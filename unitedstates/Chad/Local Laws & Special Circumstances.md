# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

You may be detained for questioning by the police if unable to produce an acceptable form of identification. Convictions for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs (including marijuana, which is illegal) result in long prison sentences and heavy fines.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification**: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

**Photography**: All photography requires a permit issued by the Ministry of Public Security and Immigration. Additionally, it is illegal to take pictures of military sites, official buildings, airports, and public monuments. Such sites are not always clearly marked.

**Telecommunications and Satellite Phones**: Satellite phones are illegal. Travelers using satellite phones risk arrest and seizure of phones. Cellular phones are widely used. SIM cards can be purchased locally and used with a compatible cell phone. The two major providers are Tigo and Airtel. Chadian networks use GSM technology.

**Military Service for Dual U.S. – Chadian citizens**: Article 56 of the Chadian Constitution states that military service is obligatory for both men and women. The conditions for fulfillment of this duty are determined by local authorities.

**Currency**: The Central African CFA franc (XAF) is the official currency. ATMs are unreliable. There are several Western Union and Money Gram offices in N’Djamena. Exporting local currency is prohibited and the export of foreign currency is limited to the amount declared upon arrival.

**Travel authorization (“autorisation de circuler”)**: Before traveling to a humanitarian zone or refugee camp, anyone planning to take photos, including journalists, need prior approval from HAMA (Haute Autorité des Médias et de l’Audiovisuel) and ANS (Agence Nationale de Sécurité). NGO humanitarian workers must submit a request for a travel authorization to the Ministry of Public Security via the “Commission Nationale pour l’Accueil et la Reinsertion des Refugies et Rapatries” (CNARR). Allow 3-4 days for processing and the request should include:

* Visitor’s or institution’s request letter
* Copies of the passport’s biographical and visa pages
* CNARR application form

**Faith-Based Travelers**: See the following web pages for details:

**LGB Travelers**: Strong social and cultural strictures against homosexuality exist, and LGB organizations do not operate openly in the country. Chadian law punishes same sex sexual relations with prison and a fine.

See our [LGB Travel Information](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/lgbt.html) page and section 6 of our[Human Rights Report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:** Access to transportation, lodging, and public buildings is limited. There are few sidewalks and no curb-cuts, and most buildings lack elevators.

**Students**: See our [Students Abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/studentsabroad/en.html) page and [FBI travel tips](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/student-travel-brochure-pdf.pdf/view).

**Women Travelers**: In addition to the safety and security measures outlined elsewhere, women travelers should never go walking or jogging alone in secluded areas, particularly at night; and never tell strangers, however friendly, where you are staying or disclose travel plans.

While the law prohibits marriage before the age of 18, forced marriage of underage girls and women remains a serious problem. The law also prohibits female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C), but the practice remains widespread.

Domestic violence, including spousal abuse, is widespread. Wives have limited legal recourse in cases of abuse. There is no reliable data on the extent of sexual assault though it is widely acknowledged as a problem. Cultural and social biases often lead to rape not being reported.
