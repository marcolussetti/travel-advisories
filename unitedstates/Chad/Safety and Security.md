# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism**: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to target crowds more effectively. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

Areas of Concern:

* **The Lake Chad area, which shares a water border with Borno State, Nigeria, a Boko Haram stronghold**: A state of emergency continues in the Lake Chad region. Chad remains vulnerable to attacks by Boko Haram, an extremist group based in northeast Nigeria, and its offshoot the Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham–West Africa, (ISIS-WA). U.S. citizen missionaries in northern Nigeria, the Far North Region of Cameroon, and Niger have been targeted by ISIS-WA/Boko Haram.

Because of the unpredictable security situation, U.S. Embassy personnel are subject to restrictions when traveling in certain areas of N’Djamena as well as outside of the capital, including the Lake Chad Basin.

**Crime:** Crime, such as car jackings, continue to be a problem. No specific group appears to be targeted. The trend has shifted from primarily nighttime occurrences to both day and night.

General Precautions:

* Avoid large concentrations of uniformed security elements, and use extreme caution when visiting areas in which the military operates.
* Avoid demonstrations and use vigilance during your movements around the city. Even events intended to be peaceful can become violent.
* Maintain caution in areas frequented by foreigners, as they may present inviting targets for terrorists.
* Be cautious when traveling outside of N’Djamena and avoid travel along border areas.
* Monitor local news and [consular messages.](https://td.usembassy.gov/category/alert/)
* Register your travel to Chad via the [Smart Traveler Enrollment Program](https://step.state.gov/step/) ([STEP](https://step.state.gov/step/))
* **Borders including the regions of Ennedi-Est, Ennedi-Ouest, Borkou and Tibesti:** Civil unrest in Central African Republic (CAR), Libya, Nigeria, and Sudan, occasionally result in cross-border clashes. A permit from the Chadian government is required for visiting the border zones near Libya and Sudan. Travelers may encounter increased border patrols and tightened border security.
* **Zakouma National Park**: Heed all instructions given by guides or trackers. Poachers have targeted rangers.
* **The Presidential Palace Compound on Avenue Felix Eboue in N’Djamena:** Do not stop your vehicle in front of this compound; avoid driving by it at night.

**International Financial Scams:** See the [Department of State](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html) and the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) pages for information.

**Victims of Crime**: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault may contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police at 2020 throughout Chad (French/Arabic) and contact the U.S. Embassy at (235) 22 51 50 17. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. Legal response or recourse for victims of crime in Chad is extremely limited.
