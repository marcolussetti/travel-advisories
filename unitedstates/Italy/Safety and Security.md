# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Emergency phone numbers**

Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes.

**Dial 112** for emergencies

**Terrorism**

[Terrorist groups](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html) and individuals inspired by them want to attack U.S. citizens outside of the United States. They are using simpler methods of attack like knives, guns, and vehicles to target crowds. They often go after unprotected or vulnerable targets.

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Airports
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains)

**Politically motivated violence**

This is most often connected to Italian internal political developments or social issues. Italian authorities and foreign diplomatic facilities have:

* Found bombs outside public buildings
* Received bomb threats
* Been targets of letter bombs and Molotov cocktails
* These attacks often happen at night. Although they have not targeted or injured U.S. citizens, you should remain aware of your surroundings. Report any suspicious activity to local authorities.

**Crime**

Italy has a moderate rate of crime. Although there are incidents of theft, violent crimes are rare. Pickpocketing, particularly in congested areas and on public transport, and break-ins of rented vehicles are common throughout the country.

**Local Laws and Customs**

U.S. citizens should be aware of the following local circumstances that could result in criminal penalties:

* Tourists can be fined or detained for buying counterfeit goods (usually fashion accessories), defacing historic monuments, and using aerial drones.
* Travelers must buy train, bus, or metro tickets at tobacco stores, kiosks, or through apps or SMS (short messaging service). Before boarding, you must validate your ticket at a machine (usually near the entrance). If you don't, an inspector may fine you. If you don’t pay right away, the fine will double and be sent to your home address.
* Some buses and trams accept onboard contactless payment (“tap to pay”) using a bank card or mobile digital wallet.
* Many cities in Italy have rules for fountains and monuments that ban activities like eating, drinking, sitting, or bathing. There are also restrictions on drinking alcohol after certain hours. Tourists should check each city's official website for more details.
* New laws make it illegal for Italians, including dual U.S.-Italian citizens, to travel outside Italy to use or arrange surrogacy. Breaking this law can result in up to 2 years in prison and fines of up to $1 million euros.

**Theft**Most reported thefts in Italy occur at:

* Crowded tourist sites
* Public transportation (on buses, metros, and trains, and at major metro and railway stations)
* Airports
* Cars parked in city centers and tourist sites

General guidance to minimize the risk of theft:

* Be alert to criminal schemes.
* Organized groups of thieves and pickpockets operate at major tourist destinations, in train stations, bars, and cafes. Criminals may use drugs to assault or rob.
* Thieves on motor scooters regularly snatch purses or bags off pedestrians. Resisting can be dangerous.
* Park cars in well-lit areas; ensure doors and windows are locked. Do not leave personal possessions, including luggage and passports, in unattended vehicles.
* Never leave baggage unattended in a car, including in a closed trunk.
* Do not leave bags unattended in public places.

**ATMs**

* To protect yourself from the risk of skimming devices at ATMs:
* Use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or secured inside a bank or business.
* Cover the keypad with one hand as you enter your PIN.
* Check for gaps, tampering, or other flaws between the ATM's metal faceplate and the card reader.
* Avoid card readers that are not flush with the face of the ATM.
* Closely check your account statements for unauthorized transactions.

**Demonstrations**

Demonstrations occur frequently. They can be anti-American in nature, especially near U.S. military bases. They may take place in response to political or economic issues. They may also occur on politically significant holidays and during international events.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Past demonstrations have turned violent.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**Weather and Natural Disasters**

* **Heatwaves** – High temperatures, especially in summer, are common in the south.
* **Thunderstorms** – Heavy rain, lightning, and gusty winds, mainly in spring and summer.
* **Snowstorms** – Common in northern and mountainous regions during winter.

These events are the most frequent and impactful in Italy. Weather varies by region. The north has more snow and cold. The south has hotter summers.

**Natural disasters**

* [Ready: Emergency Preparedness Campaign](https://www.ready.gov/) [U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards)
* [Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards%22HYPERLINK%20%22https:/www.ingv.it/)

The Italian Civil Protection agency is well-equipped to help both Italians and visitors during natural disasters.

* **Earthquakes:** Thereare several major fault lines that cross Italy. Earthquakes are frequent.
* **Flooding:** High tides in Venice can cause flooding.
* **Avalanches:** Common in mountainous areas. May occasionally occur after heavy snowfall in the winter.
* **Volcanoes:** There are several active volcanoes, including Mt. Etna in eastern Sicily. Travelers to Sicily should be aware of the possibility of travel disruptions, including airport closures, in the event of volcanic activity. Italy has many other areas of potential volcanic activity, especially near Naples.

Any visit to an active volcano or volcanic field is risky. Eruptions can occur with little to no warning. Exercise caution, follow posted instructions, stay on authorized trails, and use well-known tour operators.
