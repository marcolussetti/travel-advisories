* If you’re starting a business or a licensed profession, you must seek information from local authorities before operating.

For more information, review [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and resources from the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116).

**Arrest notification**

* If you are [arrested or detained](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html), ask police or prison officials to inform the U.S. embassy or consulate of your destination immediately.
* **Counterfeit and pirated goods**
* Counterfeit and pirated goods are common but may be illegal according to local laws.
* They may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety.

**Surrogacy**

**New laws** make it illegal for Italian citizens, including dual U.S.-Italian citizens, to travel abroad for surrogacy or to arrange it. Breaking this law can result in up to 2 years in prison and fines of up to $1 million euros. The law also affects Italian parents, spouses, or partners of U.S. citizens who use surrogacy. It applies to actions after 2024.

**Travelers with disabilities**

The law in Italy prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities, and this is enforced. This includes those with physical, sensory, intellectual, or mental disabilities.

* Accessibility in Italy is uneven. Most lodgings and buildings are accessible, but public transportation and some services may have limited access. This is especially the case in smaller towns and rural areas.
* Passengers with reduced mobility can request free assistance on board trains and in stations that are part of Italian Railway’s Sala Blu network. To receive assistance, passengers must communicate their needs to the railway company or station manager. Bookings should be made at least 24 hours in advance in person, online, by phone and email, or using the SALABLU+ app. For additional information, review the [Sala Blu site](https://www.rfi.it/en/for-persons-with-disability/information-about-the-assistance-of-the-sala-blu-in-one-click.html) or SalaBlu+ app for iOS and Android).
* Rental cars with hand controls are available from major rental companies. But it's important to reserve it well in advance.
* Equipment and repair services are usually accessible. Sign language interpreters and personal assistants are available in many locations. Contact the U.S. Embassy in Italy for a list of providers.
* Italy uses a 220-volt electrical system. You may need a transformer and plug adapter to recharge a power wheelchair.
* If traveling with a guide dog, bring the [required EU documents](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/carry/pets-and-other-animals/index_en.htm).
