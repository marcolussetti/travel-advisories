**ROAD CONDITIONS AND SAFETY:**While in Italy, you may encounter road conditions that differ significantly from those in the United States such as:

* Traffic lights are limited and often disobeyed.
* Motor scooters are very popular, and their riders may behave unexpectedly.
* Drivers frequently pass on superhighways (autostrada) at very high speeds.
* Rural roads are generally narrow, often have no guardrails, and inconsistent speed limits.
* Be careful when crossing streets even when using a marked crosswalk with a green walk (avanti) light illuminated.

**Traffic Laws:**

* Seat belt use is compulsory.
* You must use headlights year-round and at all times outside of urban areas.
* During the autumn/winter months, it is compulsory to have either winter tires or carry snow chains if driving outside urban areas.
* If you are stopped, under certain conditions you are expected to pay the police officer issuing the ticket immediately. Be prepared to pay in cash in local currency. Local police can confiscate your car if you cannot pay the fine.
* Fines are imposed if driving without the proper permits in historic downtown areas of cities and towns throughout Italy. Cameras photograph the license plates of cars illegally driving in parts of the city that require a permit. The fines imposed for these violations are forwarded to the driver’s home in the United States to request payment. For definitive legal guidance or to contest a fine, you should consult a lawyer licensed to practice in Italy. [See the U.S. Embassy of Rome’s transportation page for more information](https://it.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/local-resources-of-u-s-citizens/transportation-driving/?_ga=1.18951160.1385935530.1457127678).
* **Public Transportation:** Pickpocketing is frequent on all public transportation, especially at train stations and major tourist sites.
