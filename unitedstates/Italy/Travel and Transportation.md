**Road conditions and safety**

In Italy, you may find very different road conditions than in the United States, such as:

* Drivers often disobey the limited traffic signals.
* Motor scooters are very popular, and their riders may behave unexpectedly.
* Drivers often pass on superhighways (autostrada) at high speeds.
* Rural roads are generally narrow and often have no guardrails and inconsistent speed limits.
* Be careful when crossing streets. This is true even with a green walk (avanti) light in a marked crosswalk.

**Traffic laws**

* Seat belt use is mandatory.
* When driving outside of cities, you must always use headlights.
* In autumn and winter, you must have winter tires or snow chains on certain roads, especially in mountainous regions.
* If authorities stop you driving a car registered abroad, you must pay the ticket immediately under certain conditions. Be prepared to pay in cash in local currency. Local police can confiscate your car if you cannot pay the fine.
* Authorities fine drivers without the proper permits in historic downtown areas of cities and towns across Italy.
* Cameras take pictures of license plates for cars driving illegally in areas that need a permit. The authorities send fines for these violations to the drivers' home in the United States for payment.
* For legal advice or to contest a fine, you may wish to consult [a lawyer licensed in Italy](https://it.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/attorneys/).

**Aviation safety oversight**

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has found that Italy’s Civil Aviation Authority meets international standards for aviation safety oversight. FAA’s [website](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa) includes more information on its assessment program.

**Maritime Travel**

Rules for operating and maintaining boats in Italy may be different from those in the United States. New rules went into effect October 2024, but they are not always followed.

If you rent a boat or go on a boat trip, ask the vendor or operator about safety measures. You can find information in English about watercraft safety standards in Italy on [the Sailing News (Giornale della Vela) website.](https://www.giornaledellavela.com/2024/10/19/boat-safety-equipment-2025-whats-changing/?lang=en)

Mariners and passengers traveling to Italy should check for U.S. maritime advisories and alerts:
