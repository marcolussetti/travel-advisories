**Traveling through Europe**If you plan to visit or travel through Europe, know the [Schengen Agreement's requirements](https://schengenvisainfo.com/):

* Your passport must be valid for **at least 3 months beyond the period of stay.** Visit our [U.S. Travelers in Europe](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/schengen.html) page.
* You will need **proof of sufficient funds** and a **return plane ticket**.
* **Passports and visas**
* U.S. citizens must arrive at Italian ports of entry with a valid passport. This regulation is strictly enforced. If your passport has ever been reported as lost or stolen, or is expired, Italian authorities could deny you entry and return you immediately to the United States.
* U.S. citizens may enter Italy for up to 90 days for tourist or business purposes without a visa.
* If you intend to live or stay in Italy for longer than 90 days, you must apply for a visa from an Italian Embassy or Consulate. Once in Italy, you must also obtain a permit of stay (permesso di soggiorno). You can get more information from the [Ministry of Foreign Affairs](https://www.esteri.it/en/servizi-consolari-e-visti/ingressosoggiornoinitalia/vis/) and the [Polizia di Stato](https://www.poliziadistato.it/articolo/214).

**HIV/AIDS restrictions**The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Italy.
