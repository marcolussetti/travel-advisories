# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

There are no COVID-related entry requirements for U.S. citizens.

**Traveling Through Europe:** If you are planning to visit or travel through European countries, you should be familiar with the requirements of the Schengen Agreement.

* Your passport must be valid for **at least three months beyond the period of stay.** Review our [U.S. Travelers in Europe page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/US_Travelers_in_Europes_Schengen_Area.html).
* You will need **proof of**s**ufficient funds** and a **return plane ticket**.
* For additional information about visas for the Schengen area, see the [Schengen Visa page.](https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/schengen-visa-countries-list/)
* U.S. citizens who arrive at an Italian Port of Entry without a valid travel document – including passports that have been previously reported lost or stolen – will be denied admittance into Italy and returned to their point of origin. This regulation is strictly enforced in Italy.
* U.S. citizens may enter Italy for up to 90 days for tourist or business purposes without a visa. All non-residents are required to complete a declaration of presence (dichiarazione di presenza). Prospective residents or anyone intending to stay in Italy for longer than 90 days must obtain a [permit of stay](https://www.poliziadistato.it/articolo/10716) (permesso di soggiorno). Additional information may be obtained from the [Ministry of Foreign Affairs](https://www.esteri.it/en/servizi-consolari-e-visti/) and the [Polizia di Stato](https://www.poliziadistato.it/articolo/view/10618/).
* Non-EU visitors must obtain a stamp in their passport upon initial entry into a Schengen country. Many borders are unstaffed, so you may need to request a stamp at an official point of entry. Travelers arriving from another Schengen country must request the declaration of presence form from a local police office (commissariato di zona), police headquarters (questura), or their place of stay (e.g., hotel, hostel, campgrounds), and submit the form, along with a copy of your passport, to the police or to their place of stay within eight calendar days of arrival. Failure to complete a declaration of presence is punishable by expulsion from Italy.

The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Italy.
