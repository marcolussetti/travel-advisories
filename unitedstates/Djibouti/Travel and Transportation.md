# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Although main roads in Djibouti City are well maintained, others are unpaved or in poor repair and subject to unexpected flooding. Highways are prone to frequent rockslides. Many roads wind through steep ravines and lack guardrails.

Police occasionally set up random roadblock stops on major roads to conduct inspections of vehicle registration and insurance.

Outside of Djibouti City, hazards include narrow roads, insufficient lighting, poor vehicle maintenance (missing headlights) and wayward pedestrians and livestock. Police set up roadblocks on major roads which are not clearly visible at night. Other risks include excessive speeding and erratic driving habits. The widespread use of the narcotic khat by drivers contributes to speeding and unsafe driving habits.

When driving outside Djibouti City, use convoys of two vehicles in case one car becomes disabled and avoid all travel after dark. Carry additional fuel and provisions (water, satellite phone, first aid kit). Gas stations are located at a considerable distance from one another and sell only diesel fuel in rural areas. There are few professional roadside assistance services.

**Landmines:** Stay on paved roads. Unmarked landmines exist in the border region with Eritrea, though most landmines have been marked or cleared from border regions.

**Traffic Laws:** A U.S. driver’s license or International Driving Permit is required to drive in Djibouti. The use of cell phones while driving is prohibited. Exercise caution at intersections; drivers often run red lights and do not stop at intersections. Third-party liability insurance is required, and you must display the insurance sticker.

**Accidents:** Remain inside the vehicle and wait for the traffic police or gendarmes. If a hostile mob forms or you feel you are in danger, leave the scene in your vehicle if possible and proceed directly to the nearest police station to report the incident. If you are injured, drive to the nearest hospital or clinic.

**Public Transportation:**Avoid all travel by public transportation and hire private transport from a reliable source. Public transportation is unregulated, unreliable, and generally unsafe. Hotel and airport shuttle services are a safe alternative. Taxis are available but are considered unsafe. U.S. Embassy personnel are prohibited from riding in buses or taxis.

The capital city and the towns of Obock and Tadjoura have intercity bus and ferry services. An electric limited rail, replacing the century-old Ethio-Djibouti railway, began operation in October 2016 with freight service and, later, passenger service.

**Hiring a vehicle:** Reputable car rental firms can include the services of a driver. Be particularly vigilant at airports where criminals use luggage tag information to present themselves as pre-arranged drivers. Do not use your passport as a security deposit. If you allow your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

See our [Road Safety page](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/safety/road.html) for more information.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Djibouti, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Djibouti’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. See the [FAA’s safety assessment page](http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/). Due to security concerns, U.S. Embassy personnel are prohibited from taking commercial flights originating in Somalia that stop in Djibouti as part of a multi-leg flight.

**Maritime Travel:** Mariners planning travel to Djibouti should also check for [U.S. maritime advisories and alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts). Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard homeport website](https://www.dco.uscg.mil/Our-Organization/Assistant-Commandant-for-Prevention-Policy-CG-5P/Port-and-Facility-Compliance-CG-FAC/Homeport-20/), and the [NGA broadcast warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings).

The threat of piracy remains significant. Pirates have held foreigners hostage for ransom. Reports of attacks on local fishing boats in Djiboutian coastal waters continue. Djiboutian military ships are clearly marked and may turn away small craft or divert vessels to verify citizenship of passengers.

Use established sea lanes, and pilot vessels in groups to reduce the risk of being hijacked.

See the [Live Piracy Report](https://www.icc-ccs.org/index.php) published by the International Maritime Bureau.

In case of emergency, contact the Djiboutian Coast Guard or Djiboutian Navy on UHF marine channel 16, or the Yemeni Coast Guard on channel 16 or at 967 1-562-402.

**Port Security:** The Commandant of the Coast Guard has determined that effective anti-terrorism measures are not in place in Djibouti ports and has imposed conditions of entry on vessels that arrive in U.S. ports having visited ports in Djibouti. Mariners and passengers on commercial vessels traveling through the ports of Djibouti should exercise increased caution.
