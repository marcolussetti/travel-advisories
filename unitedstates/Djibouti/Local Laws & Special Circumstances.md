# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business. Convictions for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs result in long prison sentences and heavy fines. **Although the narcotic *khat* is legal in Djibouti, it is illegal in many countries, including the United States.** Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) website.

**Photography:** It is illegal to take pictures of government buildings, military installations or personnel, and other infrastructure such as air and seaports, bridges, and public buildings, as well as of religious sites, such as mosques. You could be fined, have your photographic equipment confiscated, and risk detention and/or expulsion. Do not take photos of Djiboutians without their permission.

**Children:** Dual Somali-U.S. or Djiboutian-U.S. citizens should be aware that moving children to Djibouti or Somalia (including Somaliland) from the United States for the purpose of having Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C) performed can be prosecuted in both countries. FGM/C is illegal under both Djiboutian and U.S. law.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information. Djiboutian law enforcement officials occasionally prevent foreigners from contacting anyone while in detention. Because of this, the U.S. Embassy may not receive notification of an arrest or may not be allowed access to you if you are detained.

**Phone Service:** Although land lines do exist in parts of Djibouti, cellular phones are the norm. You may purchase a SIM card locally for use in an unlocked GSM cell phone. You will need to present your passport to complete the purchase. The national cellular phone provider is Djibouti Telecom. Telecommunications systems outside of Djibouti City are unreliable or non-existent.

**Currency:** The Djiboutian Franc (DJF) is the official currency. It is a cash economy; credit cards are accepted at major hotels and supermarkets only. Most vendors and banks will only take bills printed after 2006 due to counterfeiting. Exchange currency only at reputable banks. ATMs are limited and may not recognize U.S.-issued credit cards, including MasterCard, though Visa generally works.

**Firearms:** Strict regulations may be enforced on the temporary import and export of firearms. [Contact the Embassy of Djibouti](https://www.djiboutiembassyus.org/) in Washington, D.C., or the Djibouti National Police for specific information regarding customs and registration requirements prior to travel. Hunting without a permit is illegal.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to relinquish them if you bring them back to the United States. See the [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1709-joint-statement-parts-c-and-d-definitions-trafficking-counterfeit) for more information.

**LGB Travelers:** While there are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events, societal norms do not allow for the public discussion of homosexuality and there are no known LGB organizations. Authorities may prosecute public display of same-sex sexual conduct under laws prohibiting attacks on “good morals.” No antidiscrimination law exists to protect LGB individuals. See our [LGB Travel Information](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/lgbt.html) page and section six of our [Human Rights report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** The law in Djibouti does not prohibit discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual or mental disabilities. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. Few government buildings, schools, banks, or grocery stores have accessible facilities, including in Djibouti City. Some hospitals and clinics are equally inaccessible to people with disabilities and lack wheelchair ramps or lifts, including some of the hospitals travelers commonly use. Expect accessibility to be very limited in transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure.

Accessibility equipment is generally not available in Djibouti. Replacement parts, rental and repair facilities for aids/equipment/devices or service providers such as sign language interpreters or personal assistants are not available.

**Students:** See our [Students Abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/studentsabroad/en.html) page and [FBI travel tips](https://ucr.fbi.gov/investigate/counterintelligence/student-brochure).

**Women Travelers:** The law prohibits female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) and the government is actively working to eliminate the practice. While rates of new FGM/C cases have declined, 70.7% of women and girls nationally have been subjected to the practice. Reliable rape statistics are not available, and laws for sentencing perpetrators are not enforced effectively. Domestic violence is common but underreported. Rather than the courts, families and the informal clan-based justice system generally handle cases of domestic abuse or violence. Police rarely intervene in domestic violence incidents. The National Union of Djiboutian Women operates a walk-in counseling center (Cellule d’Ecoute) in Djibouti City that provides services and referrals for women and men.
