**Border with Eritrea - Level 3: Reconsider Travel**

U.S. citizens should reconsider travel within 10 miles of the border with Eritrea in the Tadjoura and Obock regions due to government of Djibouti restrictions.

The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in the region. U.S. government employees are prohibited from travelling after dark anywhere within 10 miles of the Eritrean border region.
