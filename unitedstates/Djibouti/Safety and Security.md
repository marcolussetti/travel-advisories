# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:**Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to target crowds more effectively. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

Although there have been no terrorist incidents reported in Djibouti since 2014, regional terrorist groups continue to threaten Western targets and interests and can easily cross borders to conduct attacks in public places where Westerners congregate.

For more information, see our [Terrorism](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html) page.

Civil unrest or armed conflict in the neighboring countries of Ethiopia, Eritrea, Yemen, and Somalia may affect the security situation in Djibouti.

Tensions along the Djibouti-Eritrea border exist from an ongoing border dispute, necessitating approval from the Djibouti government before travel north of Obock. Border skirmishes have occurred in the past.

Many border areas between Djibouti and both Ethiopia and Somalia lack visible demarcation and may still contain landmines.

**Crime:** Crimes of opportunity are most common and include pickpocketing, purse snatching, theft from or of vehicles, and [identity theft](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-fraud/identity-theft/identity-theft-and-identity-fraud) (by stealing credit card information).

* Avoid walking alone, especially after dark, and displaying cash and valuable personal property.
* Avoid actions that would draw attention to yourself.
* Dress conservatively.
* Drive with doors locked and windows closed.
* Travel with a copy of your U.S. passport and Djibouti visa to prevent the originals from being taken. Keep original documents in a secure location.
* Keep your credit card in your sight at all times while it is being processed. Consider using prepaid credit cards with limited funds when traveling.

**Demonstrations:** Demonstrations occur occasionally and sometimes without warning. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

* Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent.
* Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas or activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available in the capital, Djibouti City. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
