# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:** Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

For more information, see our [Terrorism](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html) page.

**Demonstrations** occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

Demonstrations can be unpredictable. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.

* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.
* Police have the legal right to ask for identification on the street.
* Carry your passport or a photocopy of it at all times.
* If a police officer stops you, ask to see his or her identity card (“legiti-MAT-seeya” in Romanian, which is the official language in Moldova.).
* Moldovan police have the word “POLITIA” printed on the backs of their uniforms.
* Traffic police should also display a metal badge on the outside of their uniforms.
* If a police officer harasses you or asks for a bribe, try to record the officer’s name, title, badge number, and physical description. Contact the U.S. Embassy to report the incident at the earliest opportunity.

**Transnistria Region**

Transnistria is a breakaway region that is not under the control of the Moldovan government in Chisinau. Visitors are required to present identification to cross the administrative boundary of the Transnistria region; those without a Moldovan government-issued identification document may be requested to present a passport. Visitors may also be required to present identification and/or a passport at additional checkpoints manned by uniformed peacekeepers along roads leading into and out of the region. Ukraine has closed its border crossing points into the Transnistrian region. Taking photographs of military facilities and security forces is prohibited and may result in trouble with authorities.

The U.S. government’s ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens traveling in Transnistria maybe be limited or delayed since Transnistria’s de facto authorities control access to the region.

**Crime**: Reported types of crime include:

* Petty theft (money, passports, small valuables) from hotel rooms, local apartments, homes, offices, trains, and public transport.
* Various financial scams, including:
* inflated bar tabs
* dating scams in which someone you meet over the internet asks for money to help family, buy plane tickets, pay medical bills, or gain an immigration benefit.
* PIN theft from ATMs by “skimming” devices that record the card information, hidden cameras, and “shoulder surfing.”
* sale of credit card information by vendors to third parties
* phishing schemes and bank account hacking
* internet auction fraud in which buyers fail to pay for purchases or send counterfeit checks as payment
* International letters and package mail are sometimes opened or pilfered.
* Sexual harassment of female visitors (isolated reports of unwanted verbal attention or touching in parks, on major streets, and in bars/night clubs in Chisinau both during the day and night).

**International Financial Scams**: See the [Department of State](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html)and the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/fbi-headquarters) pages for information.

**Victims of Crime**: U.S. citizen victims of crime, including sexual assault, should report crimes to the local police at 112 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(373) (22) 40-83-00. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.

U.S. citizens should be aware that there have been reports of widespread corruption in all areas of the judicial system, including case dismissals without cause. In most cases, an investigation will not proceed if the complainant leaves the country prior to full conclusion of proceedings. Persons wishing to report incidents of corruption may contact the National Anticorruption Center hotline: 0 800 55555 active 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

**Domestic Violence**: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance.

**Tourism**: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).
