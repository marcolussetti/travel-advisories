# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

Visit the [Embassy of Moldova](https://sua.mfa.gov.md/en) website for the most current visa information.

**Entry Requirements for U.S. Citizens**

Your U.S. passport must be valid at least three months to be admitted into Moldova. If your passport is not valid for three months, you may be refused boarding by the airline at your point of origin or while transferring planes *en route* to Moldova. The U.S. Embassy, however, recommends that you have at least six months validity on your passport. To ensure that your travel plans are not disrupted, plan ahead to renew your passport before traveling. Visit the Department of State’s [passport website](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports.html) for information on applying for a new or renewed passport.

There are no special requirements for U.S. citizens entering Moldova from Romania or Ukraine at official entry points. If you enter Moldova through the separatist region of Transnistria, you should register your arrival within three days with Moldovan authorities. Transnistria is a breakaway region that is not under the control of the central government in Chisinau. A separatist regime controls the region and access to U.S. citizens is difficult. The U.S. Embassy may not be able to help if you encounter difficulties there. For more information on travel to Transnistria, please see the section on “Safety and Security” in the [Moldova International Travel Information website](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Moldova.html).

**Entering Moldova by Car**

To enter Moldova by car, a driver must be prepared to submit the following documents to the Border Police Officer:

* Driver’s license issued in the driver’s name, valid for that vehicle category;
* Valid vehicle registration;
* International insurance documents valid in Moldova or valid for the destination/transit countries if the vehicle is registered in Moldova (“cartea verde” or green card – this is sold at kiosks near the border);
* Proof of payment of the Moldovan road tax (“vinieta,” or “vignette”). This can be obtained online on the following link: <https://evinieta.gov.md/> or at kiosks near the border crossing points;
* If the car is registered in a different name, documents confirming the ownership or permission from the owner for the driver to take the vehicle across international borders.

Note: U.S. Military Official Travel and Leave; Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) documents, i.e., vehicle registrations, personnel IDs etc. are NOT valid/accepted documents for entering the Republic of Moldova by land.

**Visits and Residence Permits**

U.S. citizens can stay in Moldova without a visa for up to 90 days in any 180-day period. Upon entry or exit from Moldova, Border Police officers will check the amount of time you stayed in Moldova without a visa in the 180-day period preceding the date when your passport is being checked. U.S. citizens who leave the country and return after spending less than 90 days in the 180-day period prior to their return, will be admitted for the remainder of the 90 days. U.S. citizens attempting to re-enter Moldova after having already spent 90 days in the country in the 180-day period prior to their return may be denied re-entry to Moldova.

**Extending your stay in Moldova**

U.S. citizens who would like to stay in the Republic of Moldova for more than 90 days must apply for a residence permit. The residence permit may be obtained at the General Inspectorate for Migration offices located at the following locations:

124 Stefan cel Mare Blvd., Chisinau  
9 Moscovei Street, Balti  
22 Comsomolului Street, Comrat  
79 Ioan Voda cel Cumplit Street, Cahul

Information on the application process can be found on the General Inspectorate for Migration [website.](https://igm.gov.md/en) The application for a residence permit must be submitted at least 30 days prior to the expiration of your legal stay in the Republic of Moldova.

If you already have a Moldovan residence permit, you must notify the General Inspectorate for Migration about any address change within 15 days. Failure to report your change of address may result in fines.

Note: If you apply for a Moldovan residence permit, you will need to supply a police certificate from countries of previous residence. All public documents issued or obtained in the United States must be authenticated for use in Moldova with an [apostille certificate](https://md.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/notaries-public/). See the section on obtaining a U.S. criminal records request below for more information.

**Customs/Import, Transiting and Export of Strategic Goods**

The Moldovan authorities enforce strict rules and regulations as to what can be brought in and out of the country. The number of incidents involving U.S. citizens trying to bring in prohibited or strategic goods/“dual use” items has increased since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the closing of all air routes in and out of Ukraine. Please note that if you try to bring in any restricted and/or prohibited items into Moldova without proper authorization, your items may be confiscated, and you may be charged a fine or detained.

If you enter with humanitarian goods, you will need to complete a Traveler Customs Declaration form, and provide an invoice confirming the value of the goods, and a donation letter. If the humanitarian goods are meant for Ukraine, you will need to submit the articles through a customs broker. Please read the information carefully. We remind all U.S. citizens that they are subject to Moldovan laws and regulations, including border and customs regulations, once they enter the Republic of Moldova. The U.S. Embassy cannot assist in reclaiming items confiscated by Moldovan customs.

The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Moldova.
