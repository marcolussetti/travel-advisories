# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:**

Road conditions in Moldova are different from those in the United States.

Roads often lack signage and are unevenly maintained.

Avoid driving at night due to poorly lit roads.

It is common to see tractors, bicyclists, horse-drawn carts, pedestrians, and livestock on the same road.

Be cautious in pedestrian areas; not all drivers stop for pedestrians at crosswalks.

**Traffic Laws:**

To be safe, don’t drink alcohol before driving. The maximum legal blood alcohol content is 0.03 percent (well under the acceptable limit in the United States).

If you are stopped by traffic police for driving under the influence of alcohol and are told that you will receive a fine or will be arrested, request a blood test to confirm your actual blood alcohol level.

**Public Transportation:**

The public transportation network is well developed but differences to keep in mind include:

Some trains, trolleybuses, and buses are old and can break down.

Taxis are available in most urban areas and vary from very old and poorly maintained to new western European or U.S. vehicles.

Road emergency services are generally responsive, although you may not find an English-speaking operator.

To reach the police and/or an ambulance, call 112.

See our [Road Safety](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/driving-and-road-safety.html) page for more information.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Moldova, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Moldova’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil

Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa).
