# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties**: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the U.S. [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

If you are arrested, you can face extended periods, even years, in pre-trial detention.

Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking illegal drugs are severe, and if convicted, you can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.

You should register large sums of foreign currency (equivalent of 10,000 Euros and above) and declare all valuable goods with Moldovan customs authorities when you arrive in Moldova. Failure to do so can result in confiscation, fines, and/or arrest.

For more information about customs requirements, see the [Moldovan Customs webpage](https://customs.gov.md/en).

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods**: Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/) for more information.

**LGB Travelers:** There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Moldova. However, traditional cultural attitudes towards LGB individuals may result in discrimination and harassment.

See our [LGB Travel Information](/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgb.html) page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities**: The law in Moldova prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, or mental disabilities, and the law is enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. Expect accessibility to be limited in lodging and general infrastructure and common in public transportation and information. The general infrastructure for disabled people is not developed in the villages and in the small cities as it is in the capital. Some accessibility equipment and devices can be bought and repaired in Moldova. It’s difficult to find a sign language interpreter service in Moldova.

**Students:** See our [Students Abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/studentsabroad/en.html) page and [FBI travel tips](https://ucr.fbi.gov/investigate/counterintelligence/student-brochure).

**Women Travelers:** See our travel tips for [Women Travelers](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/women-travelers.html).

**Special Circumstances:** Credit cards are accepted in Chisinau, and occasionally in the rest of the country, but rarely in small villages. Use your credit card with caution and protect your personal information.

Individuals considering doing business in Transnistria, a breakaway region that is not under the control of the Moldovan government in Chisinau, should exercise extreme caution. Many Transnistrian firms are not legally registered with Moldovan authorities, which may complicate or prevent the import or export of goods. The government of Moldova will not recognize the validity of contracts for the privatization of firms in Transnistria without the approval of the appropriate Moldovan authorities. Western credit cards and cell phones do not work in Transnistria; Moldovan leii are not accepted as a form of payment in Transnistria.

The U.S. government’s ability to provide services to U.S. citizens traveling in Transnistria may be limited or delayed since Transnistria’s de facto authorities control access to the region.
