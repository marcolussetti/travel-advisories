**For emergency services in Moldova, dial 112.**

Ambulance services are:

* widely available but training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.

**We do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance overseas. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the Moldovan [Medicines and Medical Devices Agency](https://amdm.gov.md/ro/page/import_produse_neautorizate) to ensure the medication is legal in Moldova.

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Moldova.html#ExternalPopup) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The U.S. Embassy maintains a list of doctors and hospitals [here.](https://md.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/doctors/) We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.

**Health facilities in general:**

* Adequate health facilities are available in Chisinau and other major cities but health care in rural areas may be below U.S. standards.
* Public medical clinics lack basic resources and supplies.
* Hospitals and doctors sometimes require payment “up front” prior to service or admission.
* In small cities and villages, medical staff may speak little or no English.
* Generally, in public hospitals only minimal staff is available overnight.
* Pharmacies are not always stocked to Western standards, and products may not be labeled in English. Poor quality and/or counterfeit medications have been reported.
