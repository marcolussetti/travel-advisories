[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

You must present a passport and proof of yellow fever vaccination to enter Sao Tome and Principe. Holders of a valid U.S. passport do not require a visa when visiting for a period of up to 15 days. Apply for a visa online here: <http://www.smf.st/evisa/index.php>.

Sao Tome and Principe does not currently maintain an embassy in the United States. Travelers transiting Angola can obtain the latest information on entry requirements from the Embassy of Sao Tome and Principe in Luanda, on Rua Comandante N’zagi, 64/66, Miramar, Luanda, Angola, C.P. 1304. For all other inquiries, please contact Sao Tome and Principe’s Permanent Mission to the United Nations at 400 Park Avenue, 7th Floor, New York, NY 10022.

There are no restrictions on bringing foreign currency into Sao Tome and Principe. Visitors leaving the country must report carrying any sums equal to or greater than 10,000 Euros and be able to provide financial statements proving that they entered the country carrying a larger sum than the amount with which they plan to depart.

**Lost or Stolen Passports:** U.S. citizens whose passports are lost or stolen while in Sao Tome and Principe could face delays in receiving a replacement passport. An applicant must normally come to the Embassy in Luanda to present an application for a lost or stolen passport. There is one commercial flight per week from Sao Tome to Luanda, so a person without a passport would face great difficulty in both boarding an international flight in Sao Tome and disembarking from that flight in Luanda. If an applicant is unable to travel to Luanda, the logistical difficulties in processing a passport application from a remote location will cause at least several days’ delay.

The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Sao Tome and Principe.

Sao Tome and Principe may deny entry to people coming from Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) affected countries.
