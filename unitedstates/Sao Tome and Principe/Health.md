Medical facilities in Sao Tome and Principe are extremely limited. You will need to travel abroad for all but minor medical needs. The only hospital in the country is on Sao Tome, Hospital Central Ayres de Menezes. They have general surgery, general medicine, and an intensive care unit. Access to medicines, including antibiotics, can be limited. Facilities are antiquated and newer equipment is needed. A few clinics provide very basic services. Payment in cash is almost always expected before treatment is rendered. The availability of medicine in local stores or pharmacies is very limited. You should carry prescription medication in its original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.

**We do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most medical care providers in Sao Tome and Principe only accept cash payments and expect payment in advance. Even if your health insurance does provide overseas coverage, you will have to pay your medical charges at the time of service and later seek reimbursement from your insurance company.

See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance coverage.

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.
