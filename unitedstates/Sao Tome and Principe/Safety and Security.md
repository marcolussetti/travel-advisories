# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

There have been isolated incidents of civil unrest in the city of Sao Tome. Avoid large gatherings or any other events where crowds have congregated to demonstrate or protest.

The local equivalent to the “911” emergency line in Sao Tome and Principe is 222-22-22. In the event of fire, dial 112.

**Crime:** Burglary, pick-pocketing, and armed home invasion have occurred on the islands, particularly around the winter holidays. Pickpocketing is prevalent in crowded areas such as markets, beaches, busy streets, or near hotels.

To minimize your risk of being the victim of crime, you should:

* Not display large amounts of cash,
* Carry a minimal amount of cash,
* Avoid wearing flashy or expensive jewelry,
* Put valuables and extra cash in your hotel safe.

If you are the victim of an attempted robbery or carjacking, you are encouraged to surrender your property to avoid injury, and to report all incidents to the police and the U.S. Embassy in Luanda. Police response time can be slow.

See our webpage on [help for U.S. victims of crime overseas](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/victims.html).

The U.S. Embassy can:

* Help you find appropriate medical care,
* Assist you in reporting a crime to the police,
* Contact relatives or friends with your written consent,
* Explain the local criminal justice process in general terms,
* Provide a list of local attorneys,
* Provide information on victim’s compensation programs in the United States,
* Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution,
* Replace a stolen or lost passport.

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance.

**Tourism:**The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities are inconsistent. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be certified by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).
