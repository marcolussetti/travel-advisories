# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

In an emergency, U.S. Embassy personnel are not first responders. Guatemala has a tourism assistance program called [ASISTUR](https://asistur.gt/en/) to help and protect visitors in the country. ASISTUR provides extra security and tourist police (DISETUR) in popular tourist areas like Antigua and Lake Atitlán. ASISTUR’s emergency call center has Spanish and English speakers and is available 24/7. You can call 1500 from a Guatemalan phone or (502) 2290-2810 or send a WhatsApp message to +502-5188-1819. Here is a [list of ASISTUR’s contacts by Department](https://asistur.gt/en/servicios/). Tourist groups can also [ask for security escorts](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd6ZYoJIemUye3yb60bHYXjsZZiqcSJ_VZVy5i07OpaJjyHUQ/viewform).

**Crime:** While tourists are not usually the targets of violent crime, they can still become victims of theft. Do not leave valuables in vehicles or unattended. Some areas of Guatemala have problems with gangs, extortion, armed robbery, drug trafficking, and murder. Reports of sexual violence are also common, and support for victims is limited. Local police may not have the resources to handle serious crime effectively, leading to low arrest and conviction rates.

**Demonstrations** occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues. They may occur on politically significant holidays and during international events.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Past demonstrations have turned violent.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**Scams:**Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Guatemala. Review the Department of State’s [Protecting Yourself from Scams](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) pages for information.

Be careful when using dating apps or online dating websites while abroad. Scammers may target U.S. citizens. Tell your friends and family where you are, meet in a popular public place, and avoid consuming suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs.

Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include:

* Romance/Online dating
* Money transfers
* Lucrative sales
* Gold purchase
* Contracts with promises of large commissions
* Grandparent/Relative targeting
* Free Trip/Luggage
* Lotteries
* Inheritance notices
* Work permits/job offers
* Bank overpayments

**Technology Usage Abroad**: Mobile devices can be compromised, stolen, or damaged anywhere in the world. Before traveling abroad, it is best to keep all software (operating system and apps) updated. Enable multi-factor authentication if possible. If possible, use a virtual private network (VPN) and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi.

GPS navigation apps can be helpful. Prior to using the GPS app make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. A GPS navigation app may give you the shortest route without safety considerations.

**Victims of Crime:**  U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance.

Report crimes to the local police through the tourist assistance program which is available 24/7. Call 1500 from a Guatemalan phone or (502) 2290-2810 or send a message on WhatsApp to +502-5188-1819. You can also contact the U.S. Embassy through our [U.S. Citizens Services Navigator](https://gt.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizens-services-navigator/). Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is not well regulated. Safety inspections for equipment and facilities are rare. Dangerous areas/activities are not always labeled properly. Staff may not be trained or certified by the host government or recognized authorities. If you get injured, you will likely only find appropriate medical treatment in or near major cities. First responders cannot reach areas outside major cities to provide urgent medical care. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. Review our webpage for more [information on insurance providers for overseas coverage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html?cq_ck=1708701048867)).
