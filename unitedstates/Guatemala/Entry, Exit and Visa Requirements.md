# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

To enter Guatemala, you need a U.S. passport that is valid when you arrive with at least one blank page for an entry and exit stamp. There is no required minimum validity period for a U.S. passport, and U.S. citizens do not need a visa.

There are no vaccinations required for entry. Review the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention [website](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/guatemala) for general vaccination advice for travelers.

Guatemala has an [electronic immigration form](https://farm2.sat.gob.gt/declaDelViajeroGt-web/pages/public/declaracionJuradaDelViajero.html) that you must fill out to enter and exit the country. Some airlines may ask for proof that you completed this form before you check-in. U.S. citizens are usually allowed to stay in Guatemala for 90 days, but this can possibly be extended if you ask. If you stay longer than you are allowed, you will have to pay a fine of 15 Guatemalan quetzals (GTQ) (about $2) for each day you exceed your stay. This fine must be paid to Guatemala’s immigration authority ([Instituto Guatemalteco de Migración (IGM)](https://igm.gob.gt/formularios-control-migratorio/)) before you can leave the country.

If your [U.S. passport is lost or stolen](https://gt.usembassy.gov/passports/lost-and-stolen-passports/) in Guatemala, go to the U.S. Embassy to get a new one as soon as possible. To leave Guatemala, you must show your new passport along with a police report about the loss or theft to Guatemala’s immigration authority ([Instituto Guatemalteco de Migración (IGM)](https://igm.gob.gt/formularios-control-migratorio/)). You may also have to pay a fine of $100 for not having an entry stamp or proof of entry into the country. Fines and amounts can change.
