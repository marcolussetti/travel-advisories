Reconsider travel to Guatemala due to**crime**. Some areas have higher risks. Please read the full Travel Advisory.

Do not travel to:

* San Marcos Department (except the city of San Marcos) due to **crime**.
* Huehuetenango Department (except the city of Huehuetenango) due to **crime**.
* Zone 18 in Guatemala City and the city of Villa Nueva due to **crime**.

**Country Summary:** Some areas of Guatemala have problems with gangs, robbery, carjacking, drug trafficking and violence. Local law enforcement may not always respond well to serious crimes, leading to low arrest and conviction rates.  While tourists are not usually targeted, they can still be victims of opportunistic crimes.

Guatemala has a program called the [Tourist Assistance Program](https://asistur.gt/en/) ([ASISTUR](https://asistur.gt/en/)) that helps protect tourists. ASISTUR works with tourist police (DISETUR) in popular areas like Antigua, Lake Atitlán, Tikal, Quetzaltenango, Puerto Barrios, and Coban. They also have an emergency call center that speaks both Spanish and English. Tourist groups can request a security escort if they have safety concerns. You can call them anytime by dialing 1500 from a Guatemalan phone number or (502) 2290-2810, and you can also reach them on WhatsApp at +502-5188-1819.

U.S. government employees and their families cannot travel to the San Marcos Department, Huehuetenango Department, Zone 18 in Guatemala City, or Villa Nueva. They can travel to other parts of Guatemala and visit popular places like Tikal, Antigua, Lake Atitlán, and the Pacific coast areas in the Santa Rosa and Escuintla. However, they should avoid driving outside Guatemala City at night because of poor lighting and safety risks. They may not use white car taxis or public transportation, like “chicken buses” due to the high chance of crime and injury.

Check the [country information page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Guatemala.html) for helpful information about traveling to Guatemala. This includes information on entry and exit rules, safety, local laws, health, and getting around. Also, visit the [U.S. Embassy in Guatemala City](https://gt.usembassy.gov/services/)’s website for local resources, like legal help, medical services, driver’s licenses, and information on residence and work permits, as well as rules about bringing weapons into Guatemala.

If you decide to travel to Guatemala:

* Do not travel outside Guatemala City at night because the roads are poorly lit, and there is a high risk for serious traffic accidents.
* When visiting Lake Atitlán, use certified tour guides and travel between villages by chartered boat. The paths around the lake can be dangerous and hard to access. Emergency services cannot arrive quickly to help.
* Avoid swimming in the Pacific Ocean because the currents and undertow are very strong, and there are not many lifeguards.
* Never leave drinks unattended in bars and restaurants and say no to invitations from strangers to private parties.
* Consider staying in hotels that have secure parking, doormen, and professional security staff.
* Use trusted taxi services like Taxis Amarillo Express, Taxi Seguro, or Uber, and only use INGUAT-approved taxis from the “SAFE” stand at the airport, hotel taxis, or vetted private drivers. Avoid public transport and white car taxis, as well as “chicken buses.”
* Do not hike trails or volcanoes without a qualified local guide, as robberies can happen and getting help can be difficult.
* Avoid using public ATMs, and do not show signs of wealth like wearing expensive watches or jewelry. Also, try not to use your phone in public.
* Check the Overseas Security Advisory Council’s (OSAC) [Country Security Report](https://www.osac.gov/Content/Report/2013f384-296b-4394-bfcb-1c9c40b9c7df) for Guatemala.
* Review the [Traveler’s Checklist](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/checklist.html) and make a plan for emergencies.
* Visit the CDC page for the latest [Travel Health Notice](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/guatemala?s_cid=ncezid-dgmq-travel-single-001) and [Yellow Book](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2024/itineraries/guatemala-and-belize) on Guatemala.
* Sign up for the [Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)](https://step.state.gov/) to receive alerts while in Guatemala and help others find you in case of an emergency.
* Follow the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Embajada.EEUU.Guatemala/) and [X(Twitter)](https://twitter.com/usembassyguate) for updates.
