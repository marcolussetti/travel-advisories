# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:**  Road hazards are common.  Secondary and rural roads have little to no illumination.  U.S. Embassy employees are prohibited from traveling outside the capital city at night.  Be vigilant of motorcyclists who weave unexpectedly across lanes of traffic and pedestrians who unexpectedly dart across roads due to the lack of defined crosswalks.

Robberies of occupied vehicles are common in Guatemala City, often by two assailants on motorcycles who pull up alongside a car stopped at a traffic light.  There have also been numerous reports of violent criminal activity along Guatemala’s main highways, including the Carretera a El Salvador (Inter-American Highway CA-2).

Armed attacks have occurred in various places in Guatemala, including:

* On roads between Guatemala City and the Petén region;

Between Tikal and the Belize border; and

* On tThe Inter-American Highway (CA-1) and the road from Guatemala City to the Caribbean coast (CA-9), due to heavy traffic, including large trucks and trailers.

U.S. Embassy employees are prohibited from driving from or through Mexico to Guatemala.

Stay on main roads when traveling to and from Antigua and Lake Atitlan.  Secondary roads in those areas are poorly maintained and have experienced higher incidents of robbery, rape, and armed assault.

PROVIAL, a roadside assistance force, patrols most of the major highways in the country.  PROVIAL can be contacted by calling +502-2422-7800.  Travelers may also call the police for roadside assistance by dialing 110 or 120, or the fire department by dialing 122 or 123; however, patrols are sporadic.

**Traffic Laws:**  Valid U.S. driver’s licenses are accepted for the first 30 days of a visit, and international driving permits are accepted for extended stays.  Laws and speed limits are often ignored, turn signals are rarely used, and passing on dangerous stretches of highway is common.

It is against the law for drivers to operate cellular phones while driving.

People found driving under the influence of alcohol or other drugs will be arrested and may serve jail time.

All drivers involved in accidents resulting in injury may be detained and held in protective custody pending investigation and/or payment of alleged damages.

**Public Transportation:**  The most common form of public transportation is the system of brightly-painted recycled school buses.  Criminal activity and frequent fatal accidents, however, make these low-priced local and inter-city buses particularly dangerous.  U.S. Embassy employees are not permitted to use these public buses.

Use of radio-dispatched taxis or Uber is far safer than hailing taxis on the street.  In Guatemala City, there are several radio taxi companies in operation:

* Taxi Seguro can be reached at +502-2312-4243.
* Taxi Amarillo Express (yellow taxis) is a radio-dispatch taxi service reached by dialing 1766.
* A Green Cab radio dispatch service operates in the suburbs near zone 15 and the Cayalá entertainment and shopping destination.
* To use Uber, download their app or go to [https://www.uber.com](https://www.uber.com/).

U.S. Embassy employees are prohibited from using the white taxis.  The Guatemalan Tourist Assistance Program, [PROATUR](https://guiagt.com/item/proatur-programa-de-asistencia-al-turista/), may be able to provide additional information and can be reached by dialing 1500 or +502-2290-2800.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**  The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the Government of Guatemala’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Guatemala’s air carrier operations.  Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa).

**Maritime Travel:** Mariners planning travel to Guatemala should also check for U.S. maritime [advisories](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories) and [alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts).  Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard homeport website](https://homeport.uscg.mil/), and the [NGA broadcast warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings).
