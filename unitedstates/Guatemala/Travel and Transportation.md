# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:** There are many hazards on the roads. Secondary and rural roads often have little to no light. U.S. Embassy employees are not allowed to travel outside the capital city at night. Be careful of motorcyclists who weave between lanes of traffic and pedestrians who might suddenly cross the road because there are few crosswalks.

A roadside assistance group called [PROVIAL](https://provial.gob.gt/) patrols most major highways. You can reach them by calling (502) 2422-7800. Travelers can also call the police for help at 110 or 120, or the fire department at 122 or 123; but patrols may be infrequent.

**Traffic Laws:** [Valid U.S. driver’s licenses are accepted for the first 30 days](https://gt.usembassy.gov/driver-licenses/) of a visit, and international driving permits are needed for longer stays. Many traffic laws and speed limits are often ignored, turn signals are rarely used, and passing on dangerous stretches of highway happens frequently. It is illegal to use a phone while driving.

If someone is caught driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs they will be arrested and could go to jail. Drivers involved in accidents causing injury, no matter who is at fault, can be held until an investigation or payment of damages is completed. If you are charged with a crime, you might be banned from leaving Guatemala until the case is resolved.

**Public Transportation:** In Guatemala City, there are green public buses run by the city. The most common way to travel between cities is by brightly painted buses, known as “chicken buses.” These buses are cheap by can be dangerous due to crime and accidents. U.S. Embassy employees cannot use these buses.

In Guatemala City, you can find reliable taxi and ride-share services, such as:

* Taxi Seguro, call (502) 2312-4243
* Taxis Amarillo Express (yellow taxis), dial 1766 from a Guatemalan phone
* [Uber](https://www.uber.com)

U.S. Embassy employees are not allowed to use white taxis and cannot travel outside of Guatemala City after dark because of poor lighting and increased accident risk.

Visit the website of Guatemala’s [national tourist office (INGUAT)](https://inguat.gob.gt/) and national authority responsible for road safety ([PROVIAL](https://provial.gob.gt/)).

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed Guatemala’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with international standards for aviation safety oversight. FAA’s [website](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa) includes more information on its assessment program.

**Maritime Travel:** Mariners planning travel to Guatemala should also check for U.S. maritime [advisories](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories) and [alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts). Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard homeport website](https://homeport.uscg.mil/), and the [NGA broadcast warning website](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings).
