Guatemala City offers a full range of medical care, but options are limited outside the city. Public hospitals in Guatemala often have serious shortages of even basic medicines and equipment. Many private doctors in Guatemala have U.S. training and certifications. The U.S. Embassy lists [medical resources](https://gt.usembassy.gov/medical/) on its website but may not recommend specific providers.

Hospitals and doctors in Guatemala usually require payment before treating patients, even if insurance might cover it later. They generally do not offer payment plans and may refuse to discharge you until you have paid in full.

For emergency services in Guatemala, dial 110. “Urgent care” centers are available in larger cities.

Ambulance services are widely available in urbanized areas, but training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards. Ambulance services are not widely available in rural areas.

**The Department of State, U.S. embassies, and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.**

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. Review our [Insurance Overseas page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Travel Insurance page](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

* We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/health/insurance-providers.html) to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the [Guatemalan Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance](https://www.mspas.gob.gt/) to ensure the [medication is legal in Guatemala](https://medicamentos.mspas.gob.gt/).

**Vaccinations:** Be up to date on all [vaccinations](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Yellow fever is not currently a risk in Guatemala, but the Guatemalan government requires proof of yellow fever vaccination for ages 1 and over if they are (1) coming from [countries where there is risk of yellow fever virus transmission](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2024/preparing/yellow-fever-vaccine-malaria-prevention-by-country), or (2) have a layover of 12 hours or more in a country with yellow fever risk, or (3) travel through a country with yellow fever risk.

**Air Quality:**

\*Air pollution is a significant problem in several major cities in Guatemala. Consider the impact that seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you and consult your doctor before traveling if necessary.

The air quality varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons. It is typically worse in the dry season. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include:

* Infants, children, and teens
* People over 65 years of age
* People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema.
* People with heart disease or diabetes
* People who work or are active outdoors
* Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast "https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Spain.html#ExternalPopup"). It uses AI, historical data, and global pollution models to create a 3-day air quality forecast for [destination].

**Health facilities in general**Adequate health facilities are available in Guatemala City and other major cities, but health care in rural areas may not be the same as you would typically find in the United States.

Public medical clinics often lack basic resources and supplies.

Hospitals and doctors often require payment “up front” prior to service or admission. Credit card payment is usually available.

Private hospitals usually require advance payment before admitting a patient.

Medical staff may speak little or no English.

Generally, in public hospitals, only minimal staff is available overnight in non-emergency wards.

Consider hiring a private nurse or having family spend the night with the patient, especially a minor child.

Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals.

Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in large cities.

**Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery**U.S. citizens have suffered serious complications or died during or after having cosmetic or other elective surgery.

Medical tourism is a fast-growing industry. If you want healthcare in another country, you need to know that their medical systems are different from the United States. They don't follow the same rules. Before you travel for medical reasons, talk to your doctor.

Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Medical Tourism website](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/medical-tourism) for information on Medical Tourism. Find out about the risks of medical tourism and what you can do to prepare before traveling to Guatemala.

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/health/insurance-providers.html) to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications.

Your legal options in case of malpractice are very limited in Guatemala.

Although Guatemala has many elective/cosmetic surgery facilities that are on par with those found in the United States, the quality of care varies widely. If you plan to undergo surgery in Guatemala, make sure that emergency medical facilities are available, and professionals are accredited and qualified.

**Pharmaceuticals**Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, which can be bought without a prescription or with a prescription in the United States, are usually easy to buy with few controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may not work, have the wrong strength, or have dangerous ingredients. You should buy medication with the help of a medical professional and from trusted places.

Persons staffing pharmacies in Guatemala may have limited training and should not be assumed to be able to provide adequate counsel on appropriate medications.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration have rules for bringing medication back to the United States. Medication bought abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back. The medication must be for personal use and approved for use in the United States. Visit the websites of [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/fda-drug-info-rounds-video/traveling-prescription-medications) for more information.

**Non-Traditional Medicine**U.S. citizens have suffered serious complications or died while receiving medical care from non-traditional “healers” and practitioners in Guatemala. Ensure you have access to licensed emergency medical facilities in such cases.

**Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy**If you are considering traveling to Guatemala to have a child through use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) or surrogacy, please review our [ART and Surrogacy Abroad page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Assisted-Reproductive-Technology-ART-Surrogacy-Abroad.html).

Although surrogacy agencies/clinics claim surrogacy is legal in Guatemala, there is no legal framework for foreigners or same-sex couples to pursue surrogacy in Guatemala. As a result, surrogacy agreements between foreign or same sex intending parents and gestational mothers are not enforced by Guatemala courts.

**Water Quality**In many areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe. You should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.

**Altitude**Many cities in Guatemala, such as Guatemala City, are at high altitude. Be aware of the symptoms of altitude sickness and take precautions before you travel. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about [Travel to High Altitudes](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/travel-to-high-altitudes).

**Adventure Travel**Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Adventure Travel](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/adventure) website for more information about Adventure Travel.
