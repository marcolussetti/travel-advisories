The full range of medical care is available in Guatemala City, but medical care outside of the city is limited. Guatemala’s public hospitals frequently experience serious shortages of even the most basic medicines and equipment. Care in private hospitals is generally adequate for most common illnesses and injuries, and many of the medical specialists working in them are U.S.-trained and -certified. The U.S. Embassy maintains a list of [medical providers and hospitals](https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fgcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com.mcas.ms%2F%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fgt.usembassy.gov%252Fmedical%252F%26data%3D05%257C01%257CSimmonsSL%2540state.gov%257Cc1f4c2feae124b182b9708dbc67a12ff%257C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%257C0%257C0%257C638321999823527559%257CUnknown%257CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%253D%257C3000%257C%257C%257C%26sdata%3DRKatPwqvGAXkMHQjVGK%252BrLRxGkSf4%252FLdZRktWH2BDRQ%253D%26reserved%3D0%26McasTsid%3D20893&McasCSRF=2053b7c40a7f4bc1de1908cc50a74a6f7a048c537a2a6c8db8270c09db099235) on our website. We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.

Many hospitals in Guatemala require payment prior to treating patients, even if personal insurance will cover the treatment. They do not typically enter into payment plan agreements, and they may decline to discharge you from the hospital if you owe money for treatment.

For emergency services in Guatemala, dial 110.

Ambulance services are not present throughout the country or are unreliable in most areas except urbanized areas.

**We do not pay medical bills**

Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance**

Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments.

**Air Quality**

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.

* Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in Guatemala.
* For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/).
