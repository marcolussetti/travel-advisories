# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you break local laws, even if you don't know it, you can be kicked out of the area, arrested, or put in prison. If you want to start a business or work in a job that needs special permits or licenses, you should get information from the local authorities before you start.

If you are charged with a crime, you might be put on a travel ban, which means you would not be able to leave Guatemala until your case is finished. This could take several months or even longer.

Furthermore, some crimes are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, review our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. Review our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Counterfeit and pirated goods are common in many countries. They may be illegal according to local laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety. You may be subject to fines and/or have to give up counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States. Review the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection website](https://www.cbp.gov/trade/fakegoodsrealdangers#:~:text=It%20is%20illegal%20to%20purchase%20counterfeit%20goods.%20Bringing,activities%2C%20such%20as%20forced%20labor%20or%20human%20trafficking.) and [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-ccips) for more information.

**Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Travelers:** There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations, the provision of information or services to persons based on real or perceived sexual orientation, or the organization of events focused on sexual orientation in Guatemala. Anti-discrimination laws exist, but they do not specifically protect people based on sexual orientation. Lesbian, gay, and bisexual persons often face social discrimination and sometimes experience abuse from the police. Human rights groups report that police officers sometimes wait outside clubs and bars catering to lesbian, gay, and bisexual persons to demand money to avoid jail. Many victims do not report these incidents because they do not trust the judicial system and fear more harassment.

Review our [LGB Travel Information page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgb.html) and [section 6 of our Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports-bureau-of-democracy-human-rights-and-labor/country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** The law in Guatemala prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, intellectual, sensory, or mental disabilities, and the law is enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. The most common types of accessibility may include accessible facilities, information, and communication. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation and general infrastructure, and common in lodging and communication/information. Guatemala City is more accessible than the rest of the country.
