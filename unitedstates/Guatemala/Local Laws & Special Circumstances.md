# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:**  You are subject to local laws.  If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.  Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

Furthermore, some violations of law that occur in Guatemala are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law.  For examples, see our websites on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://ovc.ojp.gov/) website.

**Arrest Notification:**  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately.  See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:**  Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws.  You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States.  See the [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ccips) for more information.

**LGB Travelers:**  There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Guatemala.  While there is no legal recognition of same-sex partnerships or marriages, private same-sex sexual activity between consenting adults is legal.

* Antidiscrimination laws exist, but do not include specific protections based on sexual orientation.
* There is general societal discrimination against LGB persons in relation to their access to education, health care, employment, and housing.
* According to LGB rights groups, LGB individuals often experience police abuse. LGB rights groups allege that police officers regularly engage in extortion by waiting outside clubs and bars frequented by LGB persons to demand protection money or payment to avoid jail.
* A lack of trust in the judicial system and a fear of further harassment or social recrimination discourages victims from filing complaints.

Seeour [LGB Travel Information](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/lgbt.html)page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:**  The law in Guatemala prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, , intellectual or mental disabilities, and the law is enforced.  Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States.  The most common types of accessibility may include accessible facilities, information, and communication.  Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, information, and general infrastructure, and common in lodging and communication. There is a significant difference between Guatemala City and the rest of the country.

**Customs:**  Guatemalan customs authorities may enforce strict regulations concerning temporary importation into or export from Guatemala of items such as antiquities and other cultural property.

When traveling to Guatemala for temporary work related to your profession, if you bring in any technical equipment or tools, you must declare this equipment/these tools upon entry.  The equipment/tools must be of a personal, not commercial, quantity.  You must take the equipment/tools with you when you depart.  If, upon entry, you intend to leave any equipment/tools in Guatemala, you are required to report that to customs authorities and pay import taxes.
