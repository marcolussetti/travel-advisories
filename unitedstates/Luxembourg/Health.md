**The Embassy does not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.**

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance coverage overseas. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on the type of insurance you should consider before you travel.

**Medical Evacuation:** We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

**Prescription Medication:** If traveling with prescription medication, carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription or be prepared to show that it is required for your personal use. As there are very limited flights coming to Luxembourg from outside the Schengen area, follow the [guidelines for medications](https://schengeninsuranceinfo.com/travel-health-safety/travelling-with-medication-in-eu/) allowed into the Schengen area.

* Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/industry/import-basics/personal-importation#:~:text=Foreign%20Nationals:,Copy%20of%20Prescription%20(in%20English)) websites for more information.

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations recommended](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/luxembourg)by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
