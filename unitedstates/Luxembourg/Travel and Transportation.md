# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Highways and secondary roads are modern and well-maintained. Road signs and markings are clear and primarily worded in French. Streets in the city, construction sites, and crossroads are well illuminated at night. On highways, a digital alert system warns drivers of incidents or detours.

* Roads are congested during the morning and evening rush hour. The city of Luxembourg more than doubles its population Monday to Friday due to the influx of cross border workers. Visitors should drive defensively in high-volume commuter traffic.
* Fog and ice can cause sudden slowdowns on highways and secondary roads during the fall and winter. Cars must be equipped with all-weather or snow tires from October to April.
* Annual car maintenance inspections are required for most vehicles registered in Luxembourg. For specifics on different types of vehicles and timelines, see the government of Luxembourg [website.](https://guichet.public.lu/en/citoyens/transport/transports-individuels/vehicule-motorise/controle-technique-pneumatiques/controle-technique-obligatoire-vehicule.html)
* A warning triangle sign and brightly colored driver’s vest are compulsory for vehicles.
* Police can perform random road checks at any time.

**Traffic Laws:**

* Foreign drivers who are long-term residents of Luxembourg must convert their driving licenses within one year of establishing residence. See their [site](https://guichet.public.lu/en/citoyens/transport/transports-individuels/permis-conduire/international/transcription-enregistement-permis.html) for details. This does not apply to tourists and short-term visitors.
* The daily mix of drivers from Luxembourg and its three neighboring countries results in a variety of driving practices and courtesies. While most drivers respect speed limits, traffic signals, and rules, some do not.
* Drivers should carry a blank accident report in their vehicle, available through all local insurance companies and rental car companies. This report is necessary for any accident not involving injury. Typically, police do not respond to these types of accidents and it is the driver’s responsibility to exchange information and file the report with their insurance companies.
* Call the police at 113 if you are involved in a car accident involving an injury or dispute. The police will make an official assessment of the accident's circumstances that can then be used if further legal action is necessary.
* The maximum allowable blood-alcohol content in Luxembourg is 0.05 percent. Driving while intoxicated may result in penalties including fines and imprisonment. Police frequently conduct sobriety checks throughout the country.

Other common traffic violations that may result in penalties are:

* Excessive speeding (3 km per hour or more above the speed limit)
* Driving without a license
* Failure to wear a seat belt
* Using a cell phone (other than using hands-free technology) while driving

**Public Transportation:**Public transportation throughout the country is highly developed and considered very safe.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has found that Luxembourg’s Civil Aviation Authority meets international standards for aviation safety oversight. FAA’s [website](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa) includes more information on its assessment program.
