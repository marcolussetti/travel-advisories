# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

Credible information indicates terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Europe. European governments are taking action to guard against terrorist attacks; however, all European countries remain potentially vulnerable to attacks from transnational terrorist organizations.

**Demonstrations** occur occasionally in Luxembourg and have historically been non-violent. Public demonstrations take place for a variety of political, economic, or social causes. Demonstrations tend to take place on politically significant days and during international summits hosted in the country.

* Demonstrations tend to be small, well organized and non-violent, and generally sanctioned in advance by local officials.
* However, even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly escalate into violence.
* Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates on the situation and traffic advisories.
* Alerts issued regarding demonstrations are now posted on the [U.S. Mission’s website](https://lu.usembassy.gov/).

**Crime:**

Thefts of backpacks, laptops, or other valuables regularly occur on the trains with notably more incidents on the trains to and from Brussels.

* Although overall crime has decreased in recent years, home burglaries have increased with the highest number of incidents occurring during the Christmas season and summer holidays when residents are likely to be on vacation or out of the house.
* Low-level drug vending has increased in some of Luxembourg’s city parks at night and around the main train station in Luxembourg City.
* Incidents of petty crime spike during the annual “Schueberfouer,” a three-week fair held in Luxembourg City every summer.
* Thefts from cars have also increased where perpetrators often damage vehicles to gain access and steal items.
