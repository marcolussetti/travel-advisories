# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or detained. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities prior to practicing or operating a business.

Bladed weapons of any kind are strictly prohibited in Luxembourg. See Luxembourg Police’s [website](https://police.public.lu/en/legislation/armes-prohibees/armes-blanches.html) for more information.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. Due to privacy laws, you must request that the authorities notify the U.S. Embassy as they will not do so without your express consent. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

Luxembourg authorities typically do not permit foreign nationals accused of crimes to leave the country while legal proceedings are ongoing.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods**: Counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries. They may be illegal according to local laws.  Counterfeit and pirated goods may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety.  You may be subject to fines and/or have to give up counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States.  See the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection website](https://www.cbp.gov/trade/fakegoodsrealdangers#:~:text=It%20is%20illegal%20to%20purchase%20counterfeit%20goods.%20Bringing,activities%2C%20such%20as%20forced%20labor%20or%20human%20trafficking.) and [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-ccips) for more information.
