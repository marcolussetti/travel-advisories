# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

Civil unrest, such as protests, is common in Madagascar. Be especially vigilant in the vicinity of downtown Antananarivo especially near government buildings, the national stadium, and historical monuments, where violent incidents have occurred.

Violent confrontations between the dahalo (criminal gangs that steal cattle) and security forces have increased in several regions of Madagascar, particularly in areas south and west of the capital.

Often precipitated by rumors or allegations of injuries to local citizens especially in areas where there are minimal security forces, mob violence and “popular justice” continues but is rarely directed toward foreign nationals. Street altercations and traffic accidents often quickly draw large and sometimes unruly crowds. Exercise caution and remain calm if you find yourself in a dispute, particularly in a public place. If you feel threatened by large crowds, immediately leave the scene, seek the direct intervention of local law enforcement, and contact the U.S. Embassy.

The cyclone season in Madagascar occurs between December and April. Please monitor media reports, the [RSMC Tropical Cyclone Center](http://www.meteo.fr/temps/domtom/La_Reunion/webcmrs9.0/anglais/index.html), and follow all official instructions.

**Exercise Increased Caution Due to Possible Protests and Civil Unrest Related to Presidential Election**

The official campaign season for Madagascar’s presidential election has begun. The first round of voting is scheduled for November 16. A second round, if necessary, is scheduled for December 20. Opposition candidates have already called for and staged large-scale protests in the capital, Antananarivo, resulting in violent confrontations with law enforcement. Such protests may continue throughout the election period and may escalate and expand geographically as the candidates begin to campaign throughout the country. Given the increased possibility of protests and civil unrest, we urge U.S. citizens to exercise increased caution and enroll in STEP to ensure access to security alerts sent by the Embassy.

We also advise U.S. citizens that domestic flights in Madagascar are frequently subject to last-minute cancellations that can leave travelers stranded in remote areas without assistance. Tsaradia, Madagascar’s state-owned domestic airline, has a monopoly on domestic commercial flights and is notorious for last-minute cancellations and rescheduling, with no recourse for stranded travelers. Those who book Tsaradia flights through a third-party may not receive any advance notice of such cancellations and rescheduling. Regional airports in Madagascar receive little traffic and will close completely if the Tsaradia flight(s) for the day is cancelled. In such an event, there are no airline personnel present to assist stranded travelers. We recommend that travelers make contingency plans for lodging and local transportation in case their flight is cancelled or rescheduled at the last minute.

**CRIME:** Petty crime in Madagascar is common in urban areas. Skilled pickpockets are very active in downtown Antananarivo, and they primarily target jewelry, purses, and mobile phones. Additionally, criminals have stolen luggage from baggage claim areas at Antananarivo’s Ivato International Airport by simply grabbing items off the conveyor belt and exiting the airport.

Serious crimes, including home invasions, armed attacks, robberies, and assaults, are common in Madagascar. U.S. Embassy personnel are instructed not to use *taxi-bes* (minibuses which operate within urban centers) and *taxi-brousses* (which travel to outlying regions) due to the risk of carjacking and highway robbery. The majority of reported crimes were directed at Malagasy nationals but Westerners have likewise been targeted.

* Avoid walking alone especially after dark.
* Do not display cash and valuables.
* Drive with doors locked and windows closed.
* Always carry a color photocopy of your U.S. passport and visa. Keep original documents in a secure location. Most Malagasy authorities will accept a color photo copy, but you may be requested to present the original.

Violent crime, such as armed robbery and assaults, is common in:

* Toamasina and Mahajanga
* Nosy Be
* Ankarana and Montagne d’Ambre National Parks adjacent to Diego
* Isalo
* area surrounding Tolagnaro (Ft. Dauphin)
* Batteie Beach, north of Toliara (Tuléar)

**Visiting remote sites:** While the government has increased the number of dedicated police units at popular tourist sites, only visit remote sites in large groups guided by reputable tour operators.

Exercise caution when traveling through these designated areas due to violent highway robberies:

* The general area south of the National Route (RN) 7 and RN 27 including the RN 10, RN 13, and the surrounding areas. Except the tourist area on the coastal roads between Ambovombe and Farafangana, including Fort Dauphin/Tolagnaro area.
* The RN 1B, which is located to the west of Antananarivo between Tsiroanomandidy and Maintirano.

**Tourism**: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur.  Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field.  In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities.  First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.  See our webpage for more [information on insurance providers for overseas coverage.](/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html)
