# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

**Drugs:** Penalties for possession, use, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Madagascar are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.

**Visa overstays** are a violation of local laws and U.S. citizens who overstay their visas will be subject to fines and potential prosecution.

**Exporting Gemstones/Precious Materials:** The Government of Madagascar restricts the export of precious gems. Before purchasing or transporting gemstones, seek clarification of the applicable laws. Any precious materials should be accompanied by a certificate of authenticity and a certificate to allow for exportation from Madagascar.

**Currency:** Madagascar is primarily a cash economy. Although some high-end establishments accept credit cards (normally only Visa-network cards), most shops and restaurants are cash only.

Although the government changed the local currency from the Malagasy franc (FMG) to the ariary in 2005, many Malagasy still think in terms of FMG. When discussing prices, you should quantify whether the price is in ariary or FMG (1 Ariary = 5 FMG). ATMs, which generally accept Visa-network cards only, are available in large cities. Dollars are not widely accepted, and $100 bills are frequently refused at banks and local businesses.

**LGB Travelers:** Consensual same-sex sexual relations are criminalized in Madagascar with and between persons under the age of 21, and Malagasy law contains no anti-discrimination protections for LGB persons. Penalties can include imprisonment and fines.

Seeour [LGB Travel Information](http://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgb.html)page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports/2018-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details.

**Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:** There is ample public transportation, but entering and exiting vehicles is precarious, and they are not equipped to accommodate passengers with disabilities. Vehicles are often still in motion as passengers enter and exit. There are no sidewalks in the vast majority of the country, and the roads are hazardous for foot travel with swerving vehicles and uneven surfaces. There are no pedestrian crossing signs or designated pathways, and crossing any street involves an element of risk. Pedestrian injuries are common. Public spaces are not wheelchair-accessible.
