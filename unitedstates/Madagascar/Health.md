Consult the [CDC website for Madagascar](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/madagascar) prior to travel.

Plague is endemic on the island, where outbreaks have resurfaced nearly every year since 1980. U.S. citizens visiting Madagascar are urged to monitor public health announcements from the Ministry of Public Health and the World Health Organization, and to follow public health guidelines and recommendations. Plague can be successfully treated with antibiotics, but it is crucial to seek medical treatment immediately, if you experience any plague signs or symptoms.

See the [List of Health Care Providers](https://mg.usembassy.gov/local-medical-resources/) on the Embassy Antananarivo web page.

**You are responsible for all medical costs.** U.S. Medicare does not cover you overseas.

**Medical Insurance:** If your health insurance plan does not provide coverage overseas, we strongly recommend [supplemental medical insurance and medical evacuation plans](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/health/insurance-providers.html).

Carry prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.
