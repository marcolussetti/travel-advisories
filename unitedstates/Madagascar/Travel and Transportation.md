# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:**Road conditions range from minimally acceptable to very poor. There are few pedestrian crosswalks and no working traffic signals.

U.S. Embassy personnel are prohibited from driving outside of major cities after dark. Certain roads in Antananarivo have restrictions on tractor trailers during the day, so trucks use the roads at night and do not always follow the traffic rules. Street lighting is limited, and it is difficult to see pedestrians, carts, and livestock. Additional risks include excessive speeding and drivers that do not use headlights

There are random police vehicle checkpoints throughout Madagascar, so carry photo identification (residency card, U.S. passport) in the event of police questioning. These checkpoints are routine in nature and should not result in vehicle and/or person searches as long as valid identification and visas are shown. However, travelers have reported harassment and bribe solicitation.

If you are stopped at a checkpoint:

* Comply with the officers’ requests. Remain courteous and calm.
* Comply with the officers’ requests. Remain courteous and calm.
* Stay inside your vehicle with doors locked and open the window slightly to communicate. Turn on your interior vehicle light at night.
* Tell the officer you are a U.S. citizen and display your U.S. passport color photo copy through the window.
* Do not leave until instructed to do so.
* Report harassment to the U.S. Embassy.

Please note:

* Local practice is to blow the horn before going around a curve, to let others know of one's presence.
* Seatbelt use is mandatory.
* The use of cell phones while driving, even with a hands-free attachment, is illegal.
* Child safety seats are not mandatory, but highly recommended.
* You are required to wear a helmet when on a motorcycle.

**Public Transportation:** Public transportation is unreliable and vehicles are poorly maintained. Rail services are extremely limited and unreliable.

Domestic and international air services operate regularly but are subject to delays and occasional breakdowns. Air Madagascar often changes in-country flight schedules based on demand; flights that are not full may be cancelled with little or no prior warning to passengers. Overbooking is also common. Reconfirmation of tickets prior to flight day is recommended, especially when flying from provincial airports.

See our [Road Safety page](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/safety/road.html) for more information. The Ministry of Public Works, telephone (20) 22-318-02, is responsible for road safety.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Madagascar, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the Government of Madagascar’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the [FAA's safety assessment page](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.faa.gov%2Fabout%2Finitiatives%2Fiasa%2F&data=05%7C01%7COCSContentManager%40state.gov%7C8dd00b52281d4a690fdd08dbdf96000f%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C638349607556195449%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=rlsL8cSD%2FS4J16NG7umuKglksE74YMsXtoMazH9Jqyo%3D&reserved=0 "http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/").

**Maritime Travel:** Mariners planning travel to Madagascar should check for U.S. maritime advisories and alerts at the U.S. Department of Transportation’s [Maritime Security Communications with Industry WebPortal](http://www.marad.dot.gov/msci). Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard homeport website](https://homeport.uscg.mil/) and as a broadcast warning on the [National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency’s website](https://msi.nga.mil/NGAPortal/MSI.portal;jsessionid=JNQ7YvGFT3NyQqvhKxlxFwyk1n1DFqshyKphwwT8Nh75XyWCBQnH!2105571521!-1841564034?_nfpb=true&_st=&_pageLabel=msi_portal_page_63).

**Port Security:**The Commandant of the Coast Guard has determined that effective anti-terrorism measures are not in place in Madagascar ports and has imposed conditions of entry on vessels that arrive in U.S. ports having visited ports in Madagascar. Mariners and passengers on commercial vessels traveling through the ports of Madagascar should exercise increased caution.
