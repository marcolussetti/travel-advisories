Exercise increased caution in Tanzania due to **crime, terrorism,** and**targeting of LGB persons**. Some areas have increased risk.  Read the entire Travel Advisory.

Reconsider Travel To:

* Mtwara Region in southern Tanzania due to the **threat of terrorism.**

**Country Summary**: Violent crime such as assault, sexual assault, robberies, mugging, and carjacking, is common. Police forces have limited resources to respond effectively to serious crime.

Terrorist groups could attack in Tanzania with little or no warning, targeting embassies, police stations, mosques, and other places frequented by tourists.  Please see the information below regarding the increased threat of terrorism in Mtwara Region.

Members of the LGB community have been arrested, targeted, and harassed.  Due to their sexual orientation and identity LGB individuals may experience a higher likelihood of being targeted by police.  People detained under suspicion of same-sex sexual conduct could be subject to invasive physical exams such as forced anal exams.
