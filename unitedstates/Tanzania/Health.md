**The Department of State, U.S. embassies and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills.**

Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance**

Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas, including in Tanzania. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) for more [information on insurance providers for overseas coverage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/health/insurance-providers.html). We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/health/insurance-providers.html) to cover medical evacuation. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

**Prescription Medication**

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription.  Check with the [Embassy of Tanzania](https://www.us.tzembassy.go.tz/) in Washington D.C. to ensure the medication is legal in Tanzania.

You can find detailed information on vaccinations and other health precautions on the [CDC website](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel).  For information about outbreaks of infectious diseases abroad, consult the [World Health Organization (WHO) website](http://www.who.int/topics/infectious_diseases/en/), which contains additional health information for travelers, including [detailed country-specific health information](http://www.who.int/countries/en/).

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.

**Water Quality & Food Safety**

* In many areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.

**Altitude**

* If ascending Mount Kilimanjaro or other mountains in Tanzania, be aware of the symptoms of altitude sickness, and take precautions before you travel.
