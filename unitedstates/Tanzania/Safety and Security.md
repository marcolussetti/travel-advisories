# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

You should review the Department of State’s [Travel Advisory for Tanzania](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/tanzania-travel-advisory.html) before considering travel to Tanzania.

**Terrorism:** Travelers should be aware that terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

There have been reports of violence in the Mtwara region in southern Tanzania. Increased activity by extremists along the southern border has led to attacks against both government and civilian targets.

For more information, see our [Terrorism](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html) page.

**Crime:** Crime in Tanzania is a regular occurrence and Tanzanian authorities have limited capacity to deter and investigate such acts.

* Home invasions, sometimes violent, have been reported in Arusha and Dar es Salaam.
* Pickpockets and bag snatchers target Westerners in tourist areas.

**International Financial Scams:** See the [Department of State](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/scams.html) and the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) pages for information on scams.

**Victims of Crime:** If you or someone you know becomes the victim of a crime abroad, you should contact the local police and the U.S. embassy.

We can:

* Replace a stolen passport.
* Help you find appropriate medical care if you are the victim of violent crimes such as assault or rape.
* Put you in contact with the appropriate police authorities, and if you want us to, contact family members or friends.
* Direct you to local attorneys, although it is important to remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may have difficulty accessing sufficient social and/or medical support and local police have limited resources. The Embassy can provide information on the limited resources available in Tanzania to support survivors of domestic violence.

**Sexual Assault:** is a risk for all U.S. citizens and especially for women travelers.

* Victims of sexual assault may have difficulty accessing sufficient social and/or medical support.
* Local police have limited resources and investigations are often not completed. Prosecutions are very rare.

The local equivalent to the “911” emergency line in Tanzania is “111”, “112”, and “+255 787 668 306” however response times can be very slow and service unreliable.

Please see our [information for victims of crime](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/victims.html), including possible victim compensation programs in the United States.
