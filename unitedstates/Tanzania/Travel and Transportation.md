**TRAFFIC SAFETY AND ROAD CONDITIONS:** While in Tanzania, you may encounter dangerous road conditions. Road accidents are a major threat to travelers in Tanzania. Roads are poorly maintained and often bumpy, potholed, and unpaved. Even good roads may deteriorate quickly due to weather conditions.  
Travelers should note that traffic moves on the left side of the road, which can be very disorienting to those not accustomed to it.

* Beware of vehicles traveling at excessive speed, and unpredictable local driving habits.
* Many vehicles are poorly maintained and lack basic safety equipment.
* Heavy traffic jams, either due to rush hour or because of accidents, are common.
* Vehicles may cross the median strip and drive against the flow of traffic.
* During the rainy season ((late March to mid-June and mid-November to mid-December), many roads in Tanzania, both urban and rural, are passable only with four-wheel-drive vehicles.
* Please refer to our [Road Safety page](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/safety/road.html) for more information.

**Traffic Laws:** Tanzanian law requires all motor vehicle operators to be in possession of a valid driver’s license. Persons staying in Tanzania for fewer than six months may use a valid U.S. driver’s license after validation by local traffic authorities, or an international driver’s license. Persons intending to remain in Tanzania for more than six months are required to obtain a Tanzanian driver’s license. All vehicles are required to carry third-party liability insurance and to post the decal in the front window.

**Public Transport:**

* Use taxis or hire a driver from a reputable source.
* Travelers should avoid using public buses known as “dala-dalas”; three-wheeled taxis known as “bajajis”; and motorcycle taxis called “boda-bodas”. These modes of transport are often poorly maintained and ignore traffic rules.
* When traveling to Zanzibar by ferry, use the high-speed ferry and purchase your tickets from inside the ferry terminal or online in advance. Tickets should include your name, date of travel, and class of travel.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Tanzania, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Tanzania'sCivil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the [FAA's safety assessment page](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa).
