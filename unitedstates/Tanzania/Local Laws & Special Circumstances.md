# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** While you are traveling in Tanzania, you are subject to its laws. Foreign laws and legal systems can be vastly different from our own. Persons violating Tanzania’s laws, even unknowingly, may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.

* Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Tanzania are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.
* Photographing military installations is forbidden. Individuals have been detained and/or had their cameras confiscated for taking photos of hospitals, schools, bridges, industrial sites and airports. Sites where photography is prohibited are not always marked.
* It is illegal to import or export an animal or animal part without export certification from the Tanzanian government.
* It is illegal to gather, collect, or remove flora or fauna, including seashells, ebony or mpingo wood.

Furthermore, certain acts of U.S. citizens overseas are prosecutable as crimes in the United States even if they are not illegal under the local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html).

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://tz.usembassy.gov/services/) for further information.

**What to Wear:** While visiting Tanzania, you should dress modestly outside of the hotel or resort. Entering public areas in a bathing suit or in clothes that would be deemed immodest according to the local community may attract negative public attention.

**Ramadan:** During the holy month of Ramadan, when Muslims fast during daylight hours, U.S. citizens should be mindful and respectful of local culture and religious views.

**Faith-Based Travelers:** See our following webpages for details:

**LGB Travelers: Consensual same-sex sexual relations are a criminal offense in Tanzania. Those convicted may be sentenced to up to 30 years in prison. Authorities use the penal code to intimidate and arrest individuals based on their real or perceived sexual orientation. Individuals detained under suspicion of same-sex sexual conduct may be subject to or threatened with forced anal examinations.**

The Tanzanian government only accepts passports with Male or Female sex marker. This applies to travel to, within, or through Tanzania.

Members of the LGB community may be denied entry to Tanzania by immigration authorities (including on Zanzibar) or once admitted may be targeted, harassed, and/or charged with unrelated offenses.

Public displays of affection between persons of the same sex may be met with harassment or violence. Non-governmental organizations that support the LGB community and their staff may also be targeted, harassed, or have staff members detained by local authorities.

For more detailed information about respect for the human rights of LGB persons in Tanzania, you may review the State Department’s annual [Country Reports on Human Rights Practices](https://www.state.gov/reports-bureau-of-democracy-human-rights-and-labor/country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/). For further information specific to LGB travel, please read our [LGB Travel Information](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/lgbt.html)page*.*

**Accessibility:** Individuals may find accessible accommodation challenging to find in Tanzania. Sidewalks are nearly non-existent and there are frequent power outages.
