# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Swedish roads are comparable to those in the United States, though secondary roads may be less heavily traveled. Road signs use standard international symbols and Swedish text. Many urban streets have traffic lanes reserved for public transportation only.

All vehicles on the road must have their headlights turned on, no matter the time of day. You must use snow tires between December 1 and March 31, and you should be experienced driving on ice and snow if you are going to drive in the winter.

You must use seat belts, and children under 135cm (4ft 5 inches) in height must be seated in approved child or booster seats.

Gas stations in rural areas can be far apart. Some stations are unattended and require a credit card with a chip to purchase fuel.

Slower vehicles should move onto the shoulder to allow faster moving vehicles to pass.

**Traffic Laws:** You can use a valid U.S. driver’s license while visiting Sweden, or as a resident in Sweden registered for less than one year, but you must be at least 18 years old to drive.

The maximum speed limit is 120 kilometers per hour (approximately 75 miles per hour).

Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, including prescription drugs, is considered a very serious offense. The maximum legal blood-alcohol level is .02% - much lower than in the United States. Swedish police often conduct alcohol tests on roads and highways. Drunk driving rules are strictly enforced and fines can be severe, including possible jail sentences.

**Public Transportation:** Public transportation in Sweden is the recommended way to travel within larger cities. Taxis are more expensive than in major U.S. cities. Most local residents use public transport in Stockholm, as parking can be expensive. The bus, train, and subway systems are considered safe. Cyclists are common on many roads, especially in urban areas.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of Sweden’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Sweden’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa).

**Maritime Travel:** Mariners planning travel to Sweden should also check for [U.S. maritime advisories and alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts).
