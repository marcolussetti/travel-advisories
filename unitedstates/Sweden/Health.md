Medical care in Sweden is comparable to that found in the United States. Non-residents are expected to pay their own medical costs in full.

For emergency services in Sweden, dial 112. Assistance in English is available.

Ambulance services are widely available.

For non-emergencies, you can visit a local medical center or clinic, called an “Akutmottagning” or “Vardcentral.” Be prepared to present your passport.

**We do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept credit card payments. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance overseas. Visit [the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on the type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with Sweden’s [Medical Products Agency](https://www.lakemedelsverket.se/en) to ensure the medication is legal in Sweden. Please note that local physicians may not prescribe the quantities or dosages of medication that a U.S. doctor would. Stringent Swedish customs regulations prohibit the shipment of drugs to Sweden. Most pharmacies (“Apotek”) are open during normal shopping hours, but major cities will have a 24-hour pharmacy.

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list) recommended for international travel by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Air Quality:** Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas. Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in [destination]. For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/).
