# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) abroad and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy in Stockholm immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

There is no provision for bail in Sweden. U.S. citizens who are arrested may be held in custody until an investigation or trial is concluded, either of which can range in duration from a few days to a year or more.

**Drug and Alcohol Enforcement:** Swedish law enforcement authorities have no tolerance for illegal drugs, including marijuana. Marijuana of all forms, including CBD products, are illegal to bring into or possess in Sweden. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking illegal drugs in Sweden are strict, and convicted offenders can face imprisonment, fines, deportation, and/or a ban from re-entering Sweden.

Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, including prescription drugs, is considered a very serious offense. The maximum legal blood-alcohol level is .02% - much lower than in the United States. Swedish police often conduct alcohol tests on roads and highways. Drunk driving rules are strictly enforced and fines can be severe, including possible jail sentences.

**Child Protection Laws:** The treatment of children is taken very seriously in Sweden. All forms of corporal punishment of children are against the law, and any form of violence, humiliating treatment, or neglect may result in the child being taken away from parents by the Swedish authorities and placed into long-term care by Sweden’s social services and/or criminal charges being brought against the offending parent. Homeschooling is not allowed in Sweden, except under extraordinary circumstances.

**Compulsory Military Service:** In March 2017, Sweden reintroduced military conscription for men and women. Dual U.S.-Swedish citizens are also subject to conscription, although persons who have previously done military service may be excluded from the requirement and should contact the Swedish Ministry of Defense for more information.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ccips) for more information.

**LGB Travelers:** There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Sweden.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** The law in Sweden prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual or mental disabilities, and the law is enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is as prevalent as in the United States. Accessibility to public facilities and transportation in Sweden is extensive. The Swedish Government actively funds programs promoting disability access to streets, public buildings, stores, restaurants, and public transportation.
