# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism**: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

Sweden has been subject to terrorist incidents in the past and the potential for a future terrorist incident remains.  As in other countries in the Schengen area, Sweden’s open borders with its European neighbors could permit terrorist groups to enter and exit the country with anonymity. European governments are taking action to guard against terrorist attacks, but all European countries remain potentially vulnerable to attacks from transnational terrorist organizations.

**Crime:** Sweden has a low crime rate, and most crimes involve the theft of personal property from vehicles, residences, and public areas. While armed violence against the public continues to be a rare occurrence, violent crimes, such as homicides and sexual assaults, can occur. The majority of violent crimes occur in Sweden’s larger cities, such as Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Malmo. Organized crime groups have also committed armed acts against each other.

Pickpocketing and petty theft are common in and around major tourist attractions, especially Stockholm’s Old Town (“Gamla Stan”) as well as at restaurants, coffee shops, amusement parks, museums, bars, airports, and on public transportation.

Hotel breakfast rooms and lobbies attract well-dressed, professional thieves who blend in with guests and target purses and briefcases left unguarded by tourists and business travelers.

Do not buy counterfeit or pirated goods, even if they are widely available. Not only are counterfeit goods illegal to bring back into the United States, but if you purchase them, you may also be breaking local law.

**Demonstrations** occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

* Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent.
* Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**International Financial Scams**: See the [Department of State](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html) and the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-fraud-schemes) pages for information.

Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Sweden. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include:

* romance/online dating
* money transfers
* bank overpayments
* online relationships that evolve into requests for emergency financial assistance

**Victims of Crime**: U.S. citizen victims of crime, including sexual assault, should first contact local police authorities by dialing 112. Crime victims may contact the U.S. Embassy at +46 (8) 785-5300 after they have contacted local authorities.  Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting all crimes.
