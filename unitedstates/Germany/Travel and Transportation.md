* **Dial 112** for emergency services or roadside assistance.

**Road conditions and safety**Road conditions in general are excellent but can differ from those in the United States:

* Driver errors are a leading cause of accidents involving U.S. citizen motorists in Germany.
* If you hold a valid U.S. driver’s license, you can drive in [Germany for up to six months](https://de.usembassy.gov/driving-in-germany/?_ga=2.204184272.1797460205.1701971157-116128102.1701971156) without acquiring a German driver’s license.
* Many German traffic laws and traffic signs are different from those in the United States.
* Speed limits are posted on large stretches of the highway, on the Autobahn in urban areas, and when the road has many curves.
* Although high speeds are permitted on the Autobahn, adverse weather conditions and unfamiliar road markings may pose significant hazards.
* Speed limits are strictly enforced.
* Use of seat belts is required in front and back seats.
* Do not park on bike paths or sidewalks.
* These items must always be in your vehicle: Your vehicle registration, insurance policy, a first-aid kit, a reflective vest, and a reflective triangle.
* In snowy or icy conditions, your vehicle must have snow or all-season tires (M+S marking). Otherwise, you will be fined.

**Bicycles**German streets and sidewalks have dedicated bike lanes.

* Bicycles have priority in bike lanes over pedestrians and cars.
* Bicyclists also have priority over cars when turning onto side streets.
* Before turning onto side streets, check for cyclists. Do this even if the light is green.
* You will be responsible for any injury or damage if you turn into a side street and hit a cyclist in a marked bike lane.

If you are walking, watch for bicyclists before crossing or stepping into bike lanes.

**Traffic laws**In Germany, if you're in a traffic accident, even a minor one, you must stay with your vehicle and wait for the police to arrive.

* It is illegal to use your cell phone while driving in Germany.
* Except on priority roads, vehicles coming from the right have the right-of-way.
* It is illegal in Germany to pass vehicles on the right.
* Germans strictly observe the ‘slower traffic keep right’ rule.
* It is illegal to operate a vehicle if your blood alcohol level is 0.05% or higher.

You could be fined and have your driver's license suspended for a set period, depending on the severity of the violation.

**Public transportation**Germany has a safe, extensive public transport system of buses, street cars, trains, and subways.

* **Taxis:** Available throughout Germany.
* **Rideshare:** Uber and other rideshare companies are available in most cities in Germany.
* **All public transport:** Use common sense safety practices such as guarding valuables and remaining aware of your surroundings on all public transportation.

Strikes in Germany can disrupt public transportation and travel plans. We recommend checking schedules before you travel.

**Aviation safety oversight**The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has found that Germany’s Civil Aviation Authority meets international standards for aviation safety oversight. FAA’s [website](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa) includes more information on its assessment program.

**Maritime travel**Mariners and passengers planning travel to Germany should check for U.S. Maritime [Advisories](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories) and [Alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts).  Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard Homeport](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings) website, and the [NGA Navigational Warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings) website.
