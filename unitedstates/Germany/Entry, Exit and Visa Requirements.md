# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

**Traveling Through Europe**: If you are planning to visit or travel through European countries, you should be familiar with the requirements of the Schengen Agreement.

* In Europe's [Schengen area](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/US_Travelers_in_Europes_Schengen_Area.html), your passport generally must be valid for at least six months at the time of your entry.Although Germany only requires travelers to have three months of validity remaining beyond their intended departure date, airlines may still deny boarding for having less than six months validity, especially if transiting additional Schengen countries.
* If you plan on transiting a Schengen country, review our [U.S. Travelers in Europe page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/schengen.html).
* You will need **sufficient proof of funds** and a **return plane ticket**.
* For additional information about visas for the Schengen area, see the [Schengen Visa page.](https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/schengen-visa-countries-list/)
* If traveling with prescription medication, review the information below regarding pharmaceuticals to avoid potential fines and confiscation.

Carry identification with you at all times.
