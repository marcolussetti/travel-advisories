**The Department of State, U.S. embassies and U.S. consulates general do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. If you are not a resident of Germany, doctors and hospitals will expect immediate payment in cash.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas or purchase travel insurance for this purpose. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance coverage overseas. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on the type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

The Department of State strongly recommends supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the [German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices](https://www.bfarm.de/EN/Home/_node.html) to ensure the medication is legal in Germany. Also read the information below regarding pharmaceuticals and the documentation required to enter Germany with prescription medication.

**Vaccinations:** Be up to date on all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Air Quality:**Air quality varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons. It is typically at its worst in the winter. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include:

* Infants, children, and teens
* People over 65 years of age
* People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas. Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in [destination]. For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/). For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).

**Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery**

* Medical tourism is a rapidly growing industry. People seeking health care overseas should understand that medical systems operate differently from those in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations. Anyone interested in traveling for medical purposes should consult with their local physician before traveling and visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/index.htm) website for more information on Medical Tourism.
* Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/index.htm) website for information on Medical Tourism, the risks of medical tourism, and what you can do to prepare before traveling to Germany.
* We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications.

**Pharmaceuticals**

* If traveling with prescription medication, visit the [German customs website](https://www.zoll.de/EN/Home/home_node.html) to ensure the medication is legal in Germany.  For medications that Germany classifies as narcotics, you may only carry a 30-day supply.  A comprehensive list of these medications can be found  [here.](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de%2Ffileadmin%2FDateien%2F3_Downloads%2FGesetze_und_Verordnungen%2FGuV%2FA%2FAnnexIII_marketable_and_prescribable_narcotic_drugs_072010.pdf&data=05%7C01%7CMacDonaghm%40state.gov%7C0bafb26bcfad4975e07608db6daeb6e4%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C638224369383801394%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=nq3vUR9WITIc9UxW%2BtX3S%2Bl4oBeIZeNNpkfC3bXF048%3D&reserved=0)  If your medication is on that list, there is an additional requirement for your doctor to complete a [certification form](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bfarm.de%2FSharedDocs%2FDownloads%2FDE%2FBundesopiumstelle%2FBetaeubungsmittel%2FReisen%2Freise_andere_formular.pdf%3Bjsessionid%3D7C93E7D191B6D0BD19B1E9F81AC6634B.intranet262%3F__blob%3DpublicationFile&data=05%7C01%7CMacDonaghm%40state.gov%7C0bafb26bcfad4975e07608db6daeb6e4%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C638224369383801394%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=9p49E2yW%2F5MtqvsLTTCo7urlFGqLBGazbNbOZ5molr8%3D&reserved=0).  You will see part E asks for the endorsement of an “issuing authority.”  As there is no such authority in the United States, travelers may have the doctor self-certify the form and enter the information of his or her practice in part E, ideally with a stamp or seal from their office.  Due to Germany’s strict customs regulations, you are not allowed to receive prescription medication by mail without special permission.  Always carry your prescription.
* Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas.  Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments.
* U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States.  Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States.  Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States.  Please visit the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/buyingusingmedicinesafely/buyingmedicinefromoutsidetheunitedstates/default.htm) websites for more information.
