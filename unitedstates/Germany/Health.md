Germany has generally high-quality medical care and facilities. Prescription and over-the-counter medicines are widely available although brands and drug names are different from those available in the United States.

Ambulances are widely available.

**Medical payments and insurance**The U.S. government does not pay medical bills.

* U.S. Medicare and Medicaid do not work overseas.
* Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.
* Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments.
* Make sure your health insurance plan provides [coverage overseas](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for reimbursement of payments. The CDC provides more information on [types of insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) available.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation. Review our [Health Abroad page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad.html) for more information.

**Vaccinations**Be up to date on all [vaccinations](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Germany.html#ExternalPopup) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Air quality**Air quality varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons. It is typically at its worst in the winter.

People at highest risk from particle pollution:

* Infants, children, and teens
* Anyone over 65 years of age
* Have lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema.
* Have heart disease or diabetes
* Work or are active outdoors

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.

* Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in Germany.
* For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/).
* For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).
