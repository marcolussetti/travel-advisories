Exercise increased caution in Germany due to **terrorism**.

**Advisory Summary:** Terrorist groups and lone actors remain a constant threat in Germany and Europe, attacking people in public locations with knives, small arms, rudimentary explosive devices, and vehicles.  Such attacks may occur with little or no warning and target:

* Tourist locations
* Transportation centers (airports, train, or bus stations)
* Markets and shopping malls
* Local government facilities
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants
* Places of worship and educational institutions
* Parks
* Major sporting and cultural events
* Schools

If you decide to travel to Germany:

* Be aware of your surroundings when traveling to tourist locations and crowded public venues.
* Follow the instructions of local authorities.
* Monitor local media for breaking events and adjust your plans based on new information.
