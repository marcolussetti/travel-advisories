# Safety and Security

**Terrorism:**Credible information indicates terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Europe. European governments are taking action to guard against terrorist attacks; however, all European countries remain potentially vulnerable to attacks from transnational terrorist organizations.

Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad.  Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack –including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds.  Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, and celebratory gatherings)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

For more information, see our [Terrorism](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html) page.

**Crime:**Violent crime is rare in Germany, but can occur, especially in larger cities or high-risk areas such as on large metropolitan subway systems and in train stations, primarily during late night or early morning hours. Most incidents of street crime involve the theft of unattended items and pickpocketing. **Theft and pickpocketing primarily take place at train stations, on public transportation, at tourist attractions, and at large public events.**  Always pay close attention to your valuables!

Be cautious and aware of your surroundings.

U.S. citizens should exercise caution when congregating in known expatriate hangouts.

Don’t buy counterfeit and pirated goods, even if they are widely available. They are illegal to bring back into the United States, and you could also be breaking local law.

**Demonstrations:**Demonstrations occur regularly in Germany. Large, public demonstrations take place for a variety of political and economic issues. Demonstrations tend to take place on politically significant holidays like German Labor Day (May 1) and during international summits hosted in Germany.  Demonstration organizers must obtain prior police approval, and police routinely oversee participants.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable; avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.
* Strikes may interfere with travel plans. We strongly encourage travelers to check transportation schedule information prior to travel.

**International Financial Scams:** See the [Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/scams-and-safety) pages for information.

Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Germany. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Most scammers pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help.

Tips to avoid scammers:

* Look for red flags like their location is far away, their profile was recently created or seems to be too good to be true, the pace of the relationship is moving too quickly, or they ask for money.
* Set up a phone call/video chat in the initial stages.
* Do a reverse image search on the profile picture.
* If they ask for help, you should refer to them to the closest U.S. Embassy or Consulate so we can work with local authorities to assist.
* If you believe you have been scammed, report the incident to local law enforcement right away and stop all communications with the scammer.

Common scams include:

* Romance/online dating
* Money transfers
* Lucrative sales
* Gold purchase
* Contracts with promises of large commissions
* Grandparent/relative targeting (kidnapping, arrested, medical emergency)
* Free Trip/luggage
* Lotteries
* Inheritance notices
* Work permits/job offers
* Bank overpayments

**Technology Usage Abroad:** Mobiles Devices are vulnerable to compromise, theft, and physical damage anywhere in the world. Best practices prior to traveling abroad are keeping all software (operating system and apps) updated and using virtual private network and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications if possible. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S.-based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi. GPS Navigation Apps are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using the GPS app, make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. GPS navigation app may give you the shortest route without safety consideration. Be cautious of using dating apps/online dating websites abroad as U.S. citizens can be targeted by scammers. Make sure to inform your friends and family of your whereabouts, meet at a well-known public location, and not consume suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs.

Germany sometimes experiences extreme weather conditions including floods, long periods of drought, and unusually harsh winters with vast amounts of snow even in urban areas. Numerous injuries and deaths occur every year in Germany’s Alpine and coastal regions. Most of the emergencies relate to the following sports:  skiing, hiking, snowboarding, mountain biking, sledding, rock and mountain climbing, paragliding, and swimming. Those engaging in Alpine sports are strongly encouraged to register with [German “Alpen Verein.”](https://www.alpenverein.de/)
