**Emergency numbers**Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes.

* **Dial 112** for ambulance services.
* **Dial 110** for the police.

Contact the U.S. Embassy in Berlin at **+49-30-8305-0** to report crimes or emergencies (after calling local authorities).

**Terrorism**Credible information indicates terrorist groups and individuals radicalized or inspired by terrorist organizations and Jihadi ideology remain a persistent threat in Germany and Europe.

European governments are acting to prevent terrorist attacks. However, all European countries remain potentially vulnerable to attacks from transnational terrorist organizations.

[Terrorist attacks](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html) from groups and radicalized individuals aim to attack U.S. citizens abroad with knives, firearms, and vehicles.

Terrorists may target crowds at:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Tourist sites
* Popular hotels, clubs, and restaurants
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

**Crime**Violent crime is rare in Germany but can occur. It is more common in larger cities, large metropolitan subway systems, and in train stations. Most crimes occur during late night or early morning hours. Most incidents of street crime involve the theft of unattended items and pickpocketing.

Theft and pickpocketing mainly happen at train stations and on public transport. They also occur at tourist spots and large public events.

* Always pay close attention to your valuables.
* Stay aware of your surroundings.
* Exercise caution when gathering in popular expatriate hangouts.
* Don’t buy counterfeit and pirated goods, even if they are widely available. They are illegal to bring back into the United States. You could also be breaking local law.

**Demonstrations**Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues. They may also occur on politically significant holidays (German Labor Day on May 1), and during international events.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Demonstration organizers must get approval from the police first. Authorities usually watch over the participants.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.
* Strikes may interfere with travel plans. We strongly encourage travelers to check transportation schedule information before travel.

**International financial scams**Follow the Department of State [guidelines to protect yourself from scams](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html) and learn [how the FBI can help](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes).

Financial scams are common in Germany. Scams often begin through online posts, emails, or letters. Scammers pretend to be U.S. citizens in need of help.

Tips to avoid scammers:

* Look for red flags. These include asking to meet in a faraway location, or a new social media profile.
* Beware if the relationship is moving too quickly or if they ask for money.
* Do a reverse image search on the profile picture.
* If they ask for help, refer them instead to the closest U.S. embassy or consulate.

If you believe you have been scammed, report the incident to local law enforcement right away and stop all communications with the scammer.

Common scams include:

* People claiming to be U.S. military personnel
* Romance and online dating
* Money transfers
* Lucrative sales
* Gold purchase
* Contracts with promises of large commissions
* Grandparent and relative targeting (e.g., kidnapping, relative is “arrested,” or medical emergency).
* Free trip or luggage
* Lotteries
* Inheritance notices
* Work permits and job offers
* Bank overpayments

**Technology use abroad**Mobile devices can be compromised, stolen, and damaged anywhere in the world. Before traveling abroad, it is best to keep all software (operating system and apps) updated. If possible, use a virtual private network and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi.

GPS Navigation Apps are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using the GPS app make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. GPS navigation app may give you the shortest route without the safety consideration.

Be careful when using dating apps or online dating websites while abroad. Scammers may target U.S. citizens. Tell your friends and family where you are, meet in a popular public place, and avoid consuming suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs.
