# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy or nearest U.S. Consulate General immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

**Special Circumstances:** Germany has strict customs regulations concerning:

* Temporary importation or exportation of firearms
* Military artifacts (particularly those of World War II)
* Antiques
* Medications/pharmaceuticals
* Business equipment

Under German law it is also illegal to bring into or take out of Germany any literature, music, or paraphernalia that glorifies fascism, the Nazi past, or the “Third Reich.”

Contact the [German Embassy in Washington](https://www.germany.info/us-en/embassy-consulates/embassy-washington) or one of the German consulates in the United States for specific information regarding customs requirements.

**LGB Travelers**: There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Germany. Same-sex marriage is available in Germany. LGB persons are protected by federal anti-discrimination laws, and LGB Pride events are officially encouraged by most large city governments, including those in Berlin, Cologne, Hamburg, Frankfurt, and Munich.

Seeour page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:**The law in Germany prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities, and the law is enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is as prevalent as in the United States. Expect accessibility to be limited in some older public transportation, lodging, and general infrastructure, especially outside major cities, but common in most urban infrastructure. Some older buildings and public transportation systems are less adapted to individuals with disabilities.

Check your hotel or destination to learn more about options to accommodate disabled traveler needs before visiting Germany.

The German National Tourist Board maintains [information about accessibility and disability-friendly travel](https://www.germany.travel/en/accessible-germany/accessible-travel.html).

All German airports and [Lufthansa](https://www.lufthansa.com/ba/en/travellers-with-special-needs) offer services for disabled travelers.

The German National Railway, [Deutsche Bahn](https://www.deutschebahn.com/en/Digitalization/New-Mobility), maintains a mobility resource webpage.
