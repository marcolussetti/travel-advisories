# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal penalties**You are subject to local laws. If you break local laws, even if you don't know it, you can be kicked out of the area, arrested, or put in prison. If you want to start a business or work in a job that needs special permits or licenses, you should get information from the local authorities before you start.

**Arrest notification**If [arrested or detained](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html), ask the police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately.

**Customs regulations**Germany has strict customs regulations on:

* Temporary importation or exportation of firearms.
* Military artifacts (from World War II)
* Antiques
* Medications/pharmaceuticals
* Business equipment

It is illegal to bring into or take out of Germany any literature, music, or items that glorify fascism, the Nazi past, or the "Third Reich.”

Contact the German Embassy in Washington or a consulate in the U.S. for customs requirements.
