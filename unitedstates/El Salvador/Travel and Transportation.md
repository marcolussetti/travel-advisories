# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

Major highways in El Salvador are among the best in Central America, but road conditions are not up to U.S. standards. Even within the city of San Salvador, it is common to see missing manhole covers and large objects in the roadway marking the danger.

Do not drive at night or when it's hard to see. Slow-moving vehicles are often on the road, and some may not have taillights. Mini-buses, regular buses, and taxis are poorly maintained. Drivers are frequently unlicensed and generally do not adhere to traffic rules and regulations. You can expect to find pedestrians walking on the roadways and, in rural areas, it is common to encounter livestock on the road.

**Traffic Laws:** Traffic laws are not enforced; drive defensively. Passing on blind corners or cutting across several lanes of traffic is commonplace. Two lane traffic circles are common and are especially dangerous to navigate.

If you are in an accident, call the police. The law says everyone in a vehicle accident must stay at the scene. You should move the car if safe and wait for police to arrive. You can leave if you think staying is unsafe. Leaving the scene could lead to future legal complications, but always maintain your personal safety. When police come, be ready to give your name, address, vehicle registration, insurance, and driver's license info. Be aware there are legal consequences to admitting fault.

Hit and run accidents are common. The law mandates that a driver must be detained and arrested if they cause injury or death in an accident while under the influence of alcohol or lacking a proper driver's license.

You may drive with a U.S. driver’s license for up to 30 days. After that time, you must obtain a Salvadoran license.

If you want to apply for a Salvadoran driver’s license, you must present an authenticated copy of your U.S. driver’s license to Salvadoran authorities. Requests for an apostille or authentication certificate are generally submitted in writing to your state’s Notary commissioning authority (usually the Secretary of State’s office.)

In December 2024, Salvadoran transportation authorities began enforcing a new “Zero Tolerance” law for drinking and driving. Driving with ANY blood alcohol level is now a criminal offense, with prison sentences of 2-5 years for private vehicles. Police are known to conduct sobriety checks and can test drivers for alcohol even if they are pulled over for a minor traffic violation.
