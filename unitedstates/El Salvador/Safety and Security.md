The crime threat level in El Salvador is high. See below for additional information on crime.

Dial 911 for emergency assistance in El Salvador. **Demonstrations** occur anywhere, and are most common near the capital of San Salvador. They may take place in response to political or economic issues. They may also occur on politically significant holidays and during international events.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**Crime:** Crimes in El Salvador include robbery, car theft, sexual assault, and other crimes.

In the past, gangs, primarily Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and 18th Street (M18) or sub factions of each, controlled a majority of the space in El Salvador and were the source of many crimes including extortion. Since 2022, the Government of El Salvador has severely disrupted gang-related activities. This has led to a significant reduction in crime throughout the country. While levels have dropped, crime, including violent crime, still occurs.

U.S. Embassy government employees and their family members are permitted to travel throughout the country but may not travel between cities after dark, except for the route between San Salvador and the Comalapa International Airport, as well as the highway between San Salvador and tourist destinations along the littoral highway in La Libertad. This is largely due to infrastructure concerns and criminal activity. Additionally, U.S. government employees may not use public buses.

Exercise caution at all times and practice good personal security procedures throughout your stay.

* Always travel in groups.
* Avoid remote or isolated locations.
* Avoid displaying or carrying valuables in public places.
* Avoid stopping at tourist overlooks, which may be targeted by criminals.
* Never leave passports and other important documents in vehicles.
* In public, remain alert and avoid the use of cell phones and earphones. These make it harder to pay attention to your surroundings and make easy targets for crimes of opportunity.
* Avoid public transportation, especially buses.
* Use only radio-dispatched taxis, taxis stationed in front of major hotels, or internet-based rideshare services.
* Choose banks or ATMs inside secure, guarded areas and remain alert.
* Remain vigilant even in well-known restaurants, hotels, and retailers within San Salvador.
* Credit card cloning and similar fraud can occur; keep your card in sight.
* Be aware of your surroundings when traveling by car. Navigation apps seeking the quickest routes may direct you off safer routes into dangerous areas.
* Drive with your doors locked and windows raised.
* Always avoid travel outside of major metropolitan areas after dark and on unpaved roads always because of hazardous road conditions and criminal activity.
* Criminals who threaten violence typically are violent if victims do not immediately comply. There have been no reports of serious injury among victims who do comply.

The [tourist police force (POLITUR)](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/ElSalvador.html#ExternalPopup) provides security and assistance to tourists in 19 tourist destinations. Avoid hikes and guides in locations without an official guide service or police presence, regardless of advice found on the Internet.

Most serious crimes in El Salvador are never solved. The Government of El Salvador lacks sufficient resources to properly investigate and prosecute cases and to deter violent crime.

Do not purchase counterfeit and pirated goods, even if they are widely available. Counterfeit goods can be seized on entry to the United States. You might also face legal issues in El Salvador.

**Victims of Crime:** U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police at 911 and contact the U.S. Embassy at (503) 2501-2999 Emergency After-Hours Telephone: +(503) 2501-2999. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. If you are in immediate danger, you may call 911.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is not well regulated. Safety inspections for equipment and facilities are rare. Dangerous areas/activities are not always labeled properly. Staff may not be trained or certified by the host government or recognized authorities. If you get injured, you will likely only find appropriate medical treatment in or near major cities. First responders cannot reach areas outside major cities to provide urgent medical care. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.

**Watersports:**  Surfing is extremely popular in El Salvador and one of the reasons for the growth in tourism. El Salvador's Pacific Coast beaches are very risky for swimming. Strong undertows and currents can be dangerous, even for skilled swimmers. Most public beaches have government lifeguards, but private beaches may not. Follow all instructions of any lifeguard, and do not enter the water anywhere you see red warning flags. In addition, El Salvador’s search and rescue capabilities are limited, and access to medical resources in beach areas is inadequate. Check the risks of recreational water activities. Also, think about your own abilities and skills. Be aware that drinking alcohol and swimming can be a deadly combination.
