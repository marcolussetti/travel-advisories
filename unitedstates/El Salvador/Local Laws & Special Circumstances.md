# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**State of Exception:**In March 2022, the Government of El Salvador declared a “State of Exception” in response to an increase in homicides; the State of Exception continues today. The State of Exception suspended several constitutional rights, including the normal protections of criminal procedure such as the right to a speedy trial. Several U.S. and other foreign citizens have been detained under the State of Exception, some in a reportedly arbitrary manner. The number of all detainees has increased significantly.

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you break local laws, even if you don’t know it, you can be ejected from the area, arrested, or put in prison. If you want to start a business or work in a job that needs special permits or licenses, you should get information from the local authorities before you start.

Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in El Salvador are severe. **(Please note that any items containing THC, even certain CBD products that are legal and widely available in the United States, are illegal in El Salvador)**. Convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. In December 2024, El Salvador instituted a zero-tolerance law for driving under the influence, and any level of alcohol will result in detention.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the [U.S. Embassy](https://sv.usembassy.gov/) immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Guns:** You must have a locally obtained license to possess or carry a firearm in El Salvador. Convictions for possessing an unlicensed firearm can carry a prison sentence of three to five years. The U.S. Embassy cannot intervene on your behalf.

**Disaster Preparedness:** Preparing for natural disasters is crucial in El Salvador. The country has 21 active volcanoes and frequent earthquakes. During the rainy season, severe flooding and mudslides often occur.

Find information about natural disaster preparedness on the [U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)](https://www.fema.gov/) website. Find information in Spanish about earthquakes (sismos) and other natural disasters in El Salvador on the [Government of El Salvador’s web page](http://www.snet.gob.sv).

**LGB Travelers:** There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in El Salvador. There is, however, no recognition of same-sex marriage and widespread discrimination based on sexual orientation in employment, access to health care, and identity documents. Public officials, including the police, have reportedly engaged in violence and discrimination against LGB persons. See our [LGB Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgb.html) page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports/2023-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/el-salvador/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** The law in El Salvador prohibits discrimination against persons with physical or mental disabilities. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is as prevalent as in the United States. The most common types of accessibility may include accessible facilities and access to services. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure, and common in newly built infrastructure. The area around the capital is more accessible than other places in the country.
