# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

You need a U.S. passport and either a Salvadoran visa or a one-entry tourist card to enter El Salvador.

* You may obtain a tourist card when you arrive at the airport or seaport from immigration officials for a $12 fee. The card is valid for 90 days or 180 days depending on passport validity and/or purpose of travel
* Questions about extending your stay can be addressed to migracion.visas@seguridad.gob.sv.

In June 2006, El Salvador entered into the “Central America-4 (CA-4) Border Control Agreement” with Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. Under that agreement, U.S. citizens who legally enter any of those four countries may travel freely among the other three countries for up to 90 days total.

If you wish to remain in the CA-4 region for more than 90 days, you must request a one-time extension from local immigration authorities in the country where you are present. If you are “expelled” from one of the four countries, you are expelled from the entire CA-4 region.

**Minors:**A U.S. citizen minor present in El Salvador for **more** than one year is considered a **resident** of El Salvador. To leave El Salvador, a minor resident needs written consent from any parent listed on the child’s birth certificate that is not traveling with the minor. The consent form must be notarized by a Salvadoran notary. The Salvadoran government will not accept a consent form notarized at the U.S. Embassy.  **The process to obtain the consent can be lengthy. Plan ahead if you intend to have your minor child travel without both parents after being present in El Salvador for more than one year**.

**HIV/AIDS Restrictions:**The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any specific HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or for foreign residents of El Salvador. Antiretroviral medication with a prescription can be imported for personal use and for the duration of stay.

**Volunteers, Mission Groups, and Non-Profits:** Groups bringing donated supplies, equipment, or medicine may experience difficulties with customs. Groups should clear all donated material with the appropriate Salvadoran government office before arriving in El Salvador. Contact the Dirección Nacional de Medicamentos (National Directorate of Medications) via email at [donaciones@medicamentos.gob.sv](mailto:donaciones@medicamentos.gob.sv) to bring in donated medicines.
