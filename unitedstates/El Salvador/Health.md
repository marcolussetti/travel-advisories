**The Department of State, U.S. embassies and consulates do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid do not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:**Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our [Insurance Overseas](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) page for more information on insurance providers with coverage overseas. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on what type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

**We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.**
