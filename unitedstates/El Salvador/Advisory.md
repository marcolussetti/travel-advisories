**Reissued after periodic review with minor edits*.***

**Country Summary:** Crime is still a concern in El Salvador, but gang-related activity has dropped significantly over the last 3 years. This includes drops in violent crimes and murders.

U.S. government employees may travel throughout the country during daylight hours. Due to infrastructure and safety concerns, U.S. government employees may not travel between cities or departments after dark, except for:

* The route between San Salvador and El Salvador’s international airport.
* Between San Salvador and La Libertad.

Government employees are also prohibited from using public buses.

**State of Exception**

In March 2022, the Government of El Salvador declared a “State of Exception” in response to an increase in gang homicides:

* The State of Exception grants local authorities the power to arrest anyone suspected of gang activity.
* It suspends several constitutional rights, including the normal protections of criminal procedure, such as the right to a speedy or fair trial.
* Tens of thousands of people are currently in prison under the State of Exception.
* Several U.S. and other foreign citizens have been detained under the State of Exception. They remain in prison and have yet to face trial.

The State of Exception is still in place. We urge U.S. citizens to stay alert and cautious.
