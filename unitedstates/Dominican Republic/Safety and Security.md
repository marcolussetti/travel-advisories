# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Crime:** Crime is a threat throughout the Dominican Republic. Tourist destinations are generally more policed than metropolitan areas.

* If robbed, hand over your personal belongings without resisting.
* Do not carry or wear valuable items that will attract attention.
* Be wary of strangers.
* Travel with a partner or group if possible.

**International Financial Scams:**See the [Department of State](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html)and the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) pages for information.

**Dating App Robberies:**Several U.S. citizen travelers in the Dominican Republic have reported that they were robbed by people they met through popular online dating applications. If meeting with strangers, you should strongly consider meeting only in public places and avoiding isolated locations where crimes are most likely to occur.

**Demonstrations:**Avoid areas of demonstrations and exercise caution if you are in the vicinity of large gatherings or protests.

**Victims of Crime:** Report crimes to the local tourist police (POLITUR) at 809-222-2026 or [911](http://911.gob.do/) and contact the U.S. Embassy at 809-567-7775. 911 is operational throughout the country apart from some areas located near the Haitian border. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.

* Provide our information on [victim’s compensation programs in the U.S.](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/victims.html)
* Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution.

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact POLITUR (809-222-2026), the [National Police (](https://www.policianacional.gob.do/)809-682-2151), and the U.S. Embassy for assistance.

**Sexual Assault:** Rape and sexual assault has been reported throughout the Dominican Republic, including at major resorts and hotels.

**Notes for your safety:**

* U.S. citizens have been targeted with date rape drugs.
* Sexual assault victims in the Dominican Republic should not expect the totality of assistance offered in the United States. Rape kits are often not available until the following morning and must be administered by Dominican authorities.
* Victims often have to request medication to avoid transmission of STDs and reduce the chances of pregnancy.
* Prosecution of a rape case moves forward very slowly. Dominican law may require the victim to return to the Dominican Republic at some stages of the judicial process.
* Security outside of the resort area, including beach areas, is unpredictable, especially at night.

**Best Practices:**

* Contact the police/hotel management if resort staff demonstrate unwanted attention.
* Victims of sexual/other assault should contact the police and the Embassy. Insist that hotel management take immediate action by contacting the police.
* In a resort, avoid secluded places. Always be accompanied by someone you know, even going to the restroom.
* Do not consume alcoholic beverages alone or with new acquaintances. Do not leave drinks unattended.  Know your limits and help your friends/travelling companions to remain safe.
* Shout for help immediately if threatened or made uncomfortable.
* Report suspicious activity, including excessive friendliness by hotel employees, to hotel management, the U.S. Embassy, and local police.
* Do not swim alone due to life-threatening undertows.

**Tourism:**The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities may not commonly occur in all parts of the country. Hazardous areas and activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in or near major cities or major tourist zones. First responders may be unable to access areas outside of major cities or major tourist zones. The ability to provide urgent medical treatment may be limited. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
