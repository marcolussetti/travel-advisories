# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal penalties**U.S. citizens must follow local laws.

* If you break laws, even by mistake, you could be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.
* For business or professional activities requiring permits or licenses, seek information from local authorities.
* Drug-related offenses, including those involving marijuana, carry severe penalties. Convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and big fines.
* Prostitution is legal in the Dominican Republic under certain circumstances; however, disagreements over price and/or claims of mistreatment result in police involvement and are common complaints. U.S. citizens are warned against hiring a prostitute or escort service.

**Arrest notification**If you are [arrested or detained](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html), ask the police or prison officials to notify the [U.S. Embassy in the Dominican Republic](https://do.usembassy.gov/services/arrest-of-a-u-s-citizen/)

**Counterfeit and pirated goods**Counterfeit and pirated goods are common but may be illegal according to local laws. You may also be fined or forced to hand over the goods to authorities if you try to return to the United States with them.

Use caution when purchasing prescription medications locally given the possibility of counterfeit pills.

**Travelers with accessibility needs**Anti-discrimination laws exist for people with physical, sensory, intellectual, or mental disabilities, but are not consistently enforced.

* Social acceptance of people with disabilities in public is not as common as in the United States.
* Accessible facilities, information, communication, access to services, and ease of movement are limited in most of the country.
* Large resorts and Santo Domingo may have better infrastructure, but it is not usually consistent with U.S. standards.

**Real estate**

* Property rights may be irregularly enforced.
* Consult a reputable attorney before signing documents or completing any transactions.
* Title insurance is recommended due to the risk of legal and physical takeovers. Absentee landlords and owners of undeveloped land are most at risk.
