**Road conditions and safety**Driving conditions vary across the country. **Drive with extreme caution**.

* The country’s road crash-related mortality rate is 65.2 deaths per 100,000 people, which is the highest in the world.
* Consider hiring a professional driver who is familiar with local roads. Licensed drivers are hired through local private transportation companies.
* In case of accidents, typically only the driver will be taken into custody.
* Car rental companies sometimes retain the renter’s passport if the rental bill is not paid, or the car is returned damaged. It is recommended to not leave your passport with a car rental agency. If your passport is retained, call the U.S. Embassy for assistance.

Common driving hazards:

* Drivers without headlights or taillights at night
* Animals on the road
* Missing manhole covers and large potholes
* Uneven road surfaces
* Scooters and motorcycles driving recklessly and weaving through lanes
* Vehicles driving on sidewalks or against traffic
* Intersections without stop signs
* Unregulated and congested traffic
* Speeding and running stop lights
* Heavy urban traffic

**Traffic laws**Traffic laws are inconsistently enforced.

* After serious accidents, drivers are often detained. This happens even if they are not at fault, until a court ruling or a waiver is signed.
* Seat belts for car passengers and helmets for motorcyclists are required. Violators may be fined.
* There are no child car seat laws.
* Police can stop drivers using cell phones without hand-free devices.
* In collisions between cars and motorcycles, the car’s driver is usually found to be at fault, regardless of the circumstances.
* U.S. citizens have reported traffic police asking for bribes instead of giving tickets. Politely refuse and ask for an official ticket.

**Public transportation**Public transportation methods:

* Metro in Santo Domingo only
* Public bus system
* Shared bus or van taxis known as “guaguas.” Available on regular routes within cities and between towns in the countryside. Converted vans or microbuses may not have doors.
* Public buses and guaguas do not meet U.S. safety standards.

**Taxi travel**

* Avoid unregulated taxis and guaguas since they lack basic safety features.
* Avoid hailing taxis off the street. Use taxi services recommended by your hotel or a well-known company.
* Rideshare services like Uber are available in many areas.
* Private bus lines travel between large cities and tourist destinations.
* U.S. government employees are prohibited from riding motorcycle taxis.

**Aviation safety oversight**The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has found that the Dominican Republic’s Civil Aviation Authority meets international standards for aviation safety oversight.  [FAA's website](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa) includes more information on its assessment program.

**Maritime travel**Mariners and passengers planning travel to the Dominican Republic should check for [Maritime Advisories and Alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories).  Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard Homeport](https://www.uscg.mil/Homeport/) website, and the [NGA Navigational Warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings)website.

The U.S. Coast Guard has concerns about the security practices in the ports of the Dominican Republic.  Until those concerns can be addressed, the U.S. Coast Guard advises that mariners and passengers traveling through the ports of the Dominican Republic should exercise caution.
