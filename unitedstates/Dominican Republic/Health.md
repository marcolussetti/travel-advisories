For emergency services in the Dominican Republic, dial **911** or **809-202-2026**.

**Ambulance services:**

* The training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.
* Ambulances are not present or reliable in most areas of the country. They are more reliable and available in Santo Domingo, Santiago, Punta Cana, and Puerto Plata.

**We do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas.  Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the [Ministry for Public Health](https://www.msp.gob.do/web/) to ensure the medication is legal in the Dominican Republic.

**Vaccinations:**Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Air Quality:** Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas. Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in [destination]. For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/). For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/). For general health information, visit the “[Your Health Abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad.html)” page.The U.S. Embassy maintains a [list of doctors and hospitals](https://do.usembassy.gov/services/medical-assistance/). We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.

**Health facilities in general:**

* Public medical clinics lack basic resources and supplies.
* Hospitals and doctors require payment “up front” prior to service or admission.
* Private hospitals usually require advance payment or proof of adequate insurance before admitting a patient.
* Be aware that some hotels, resorts, etc. have exclusive agreements with medical providers, which have costs associated and may limit your choices in seeking emergency medical attention.
* Medical staff may speak little or no English.
* Generally, in public hospitals only minimal staff is available overnight in non-emergency wards. Consider hiring a private nurse or having family spend the night with the patient, especially a minor child.
* Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals.
* Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions

**Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery**

U.S. citizens have suffered serious complications or died during or after having cosmetic or other elective surgery.

If you are considering travel to the Dominican Republic for cosmetic surgery, be mindful of the following:

* Have a medical evaluation from a U.S. doctor to determine if you are a good candidate for surgery.
* Before travel, carefully research the doctor (e.g. qualifications, experience performing the surgery, complication rate) and credentials of the recovery facility you plan to use.
* Share all health information (e.g. medical conditions, medications, allergies) with your doctor before your surgery.
* Obtain international travel insurance that covers medical evacuation back to the United States and repatriation of remains.
