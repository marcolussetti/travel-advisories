**Vaccinations**Visit your doctor at least one month before travel and [update your vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/dominican-republic) for travel to the Dominican Republic.

**Emergency numbers  
Dial 911** or contact local tourist police (POLITUR) at **809-222-2026** for emergency services.

**Ambulance services**

* Emergency responder training and availability may be below U.S. standards.
* Ambulances are generally unreliable and/or unavailable in most areas.
* They are more reliable and available in Santo Domingo, Santiago, Punta Cana, and Puerto Plata.

**Medical payments and insurance**

* The U.S. government does not pay medical bills.
* U.S. Medicare and Medicaid do not work overseas.
* Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.
* Some care providers overseas only accept cash payments.
* Make sure your health insurance plan provides [insurance coverage overseas](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for reimbursement of payments. The CDC provides more information on types of [Travel Insurance](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) available.
* We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.
* In the Dominican Republic, private clinics sometimes hold a patient, including his/her passport, or the remains of a deceased person, over unpaid medical bills. If this happens, contact the [Superintendence of Health and Occupational Risks (SISALRIL)](https://www.sisalril.gob.do/index.php "Original URL: https://www.sisalril.gob.do/index.php. Click or tap if you trust this link.") and/or the U.S. Embassy. It is illegal under Dominican law to retain an individual’s passport or hold them in a hospital for failure to pay medical bills. If this happens, please contact the U.S. Embassy for help assistance.

**Prescription drugs**

* Confirm that your medication is legal and listed on the [Ministry of Public Health](https://www.msp.gob.do/web/) (source: Dominican Republic, in Spanish)
* Take your prescription medication in the original labeled packaging.
* Bring a copy of your doctor’s prescription.
* We recommend caution when purchasing prescription medications locally given the possibility of counterfeit pills. If purchased, only buy from a pharmacy after receiving a doctor’s prescription.

**Health facilities**

* Refer to this list of [doctors and hospitals](https://do.usembassy.gov/services/medical-assistance/) if you need healthcare in the Dominican Republic. (source: U.S. Embassy in the Dominican Republic). We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.
* Public medical clinics lack basic resources and supplies.
* Hospitals and doctors require a deposit before service or admission.
* Private hospitals need advance payment or proof of internationally-accepted insurance before admitting a patient.
* Some hotels and resorts have exclusive agreements with medical providers, which can limit your choices and add costs to emergency medical attention.
* Medical staff may speak little or no English.
* Public hospitals have minimal staff overnight in non-emergency wards. Consider hiring a private nurse or having family stay with the patient, especially a minor child.
* Patients are responsible for all medical expenses, including costs for transfer between hospitals.
* Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in larger cities.

**Medical tourism and elective surgery**Many U.S. citizens have suffered **serious complications or died** during or after cosmetic or other elective surgery in the Dominican Republic.

* Before traveling for surgery, get a medical evaluation from a U.S. doctor to determine if you are a good candidate. Refer to this list to see if your medical professional is licensed and accredited: [Consulta de Exequatur - Servicio Nacional de Salud](https://sns.gob.do/herramientas-de-consulta/consulta-de-exequatur/).
* Research the doctor’s qualifications, experience, and complication rate. Review the medical facility’s credentials before traveling.
* Share all health history information with your doctor before surgery.
* See a travel medicine professional in the United States at least 4-6 weeks before your trip to discuss [medical tourism](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/medical-tourism) and to learn about specific risks related to your surgery and travel.
* Legal options in case of malpractice are very limited in the Dominican Republic.

**Water quality**

* Tap water in many areas is not safe to drink.
* Bottled water is safe and should be requested at restaurants and hotels.
* Request “no ice” in drinks because it may be made from tap water.

**Adventure travel**

* [Adventure travel and sports](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/adventure-travel.html) may not be covered by accident insurance and safety protections.
* [Follow advice from the CDC](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/adventure) to prepare for your trip.
