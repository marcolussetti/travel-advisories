# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:**Motorbikes and motorcycles are extremely prevalent on the roads in Benin and will unexpectedly appear or switch lanes. Traffic signals are rare and may not be operational or followed. Pedestrians, non-motorized carts, broken-down vehicles, and debris are often present in even the busiest of roads.

Roads in Benin are generally in poor condition. During the rainy season (from mid-June to mid-September), dirt roads become impassable. Four-wheel drive vehicles with full spare tires and emergency equipment are recommended.

Gasoline smuggled from Nigeria is widely available in glass bottles and jugs at informal roadside stands throughout Cotonou and much of the country. This gasoline is of unreliable quality, as it often contains water or other contaminants that can damage or disable your vehicle. Drivers should purchase fuel only from official service stations. There are periodic gas shortages, especially in the north of the country where there are fewer service stations.

The U.S. Embassy prohibits travel by diplomatic personnel outside of metropolitan areas after dusk and urges all U.S. citizens to avoid night driving due to road safety and crime concerns.

**Traffic Laws:**Traffic moves on the right. In traffic circles, vehicles inside the circle must yield to those entering. Many drivers do not follow traffic laws.

When stopped by the police, you must have all of your vehicle’s documentation available to present to the authorities.

**Public Transportation:** Cotonou has a limited public transportation system. Many Beninese people rely on bicycles, mopeds, and motorbikes for hire (known as “zemidjans”). Travelers using zemidjans, particularly at night, are much more vulnerable to being mugged, assaulted, or robbed. Buses and private taxis offer service in the interior. U.S. Embassy personnel are required to wear safety helmets when on a motorcycle and are prohibited from using zemidjans.

See our [Road Safety](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/safety/road.html) page for more information.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Benin, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Benin’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/).

**Maritime Travel:** Mariners planning travel to Benin should also check for [U.S. maritime advisories and alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts).  Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard homeport website](https://homeport.uscg.mil/), and the [NGA broadcast warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings).
