**Country Summary:**   
Bandits, criminal organizations, and terrorist groups are active in Benin, particularly in areas of Benin bordering Burkina Faso and Niger. Attacks in these areas can occur with little or no warning, and could target shops, markets, hotels, places of worship, restaurants, bars, schools, government installations, transportation hubs, and other places where crowds gather.  Violent attacks are far more likely in the northern areas of Benin than in the southern and coastal areas.

Crimes such as robbery and assault occur in Benin. These crimes often happen at night and in isolated locations. Crime occurs more frequently in urban areas and crowded markets.

Foreign nationals and residents traveling in these areas have been kidnapped in Park Pendjari.

Bandits, criminal organizations, and terrorist groups are active in the vicinity of Kandi and Tanguieta and in the northeastern border region between Benin and Nigeria, specifically in the border region north of Nikki. Foreign nationals and residents are at risk of kidnapping in this region.

The U.S. government has limited ability to provide routine or emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in Benin’s northern border areas. U.S. government employees under Chief of Mission security responsibility are prohibited from personal travel and must obtain special authorization for official travel to the areas described above.
