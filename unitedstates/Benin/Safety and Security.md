# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:**Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad.  Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected and focused on vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

Extremist groups have carried out attacks in areas of Burkina Faso adjacent to Benin’s northern border, near Park Pendjari, Park W, and adjacent hunting zones. Attacks may occur with little or no warning. Western tourists have been kidnapped in Park Pendjari in northern Benin. U.S. government employees are restricted from personal travel to Park Pendjari, Park W, other areas within 50 km of Benin’s northern border with Burkina Faso, and areas north of the RNIE 7 route from Banikoara to the Nigerian border (not including the cities of Kandi and Segbana). The U.S. Department of State recommends tourists reconsider travel to these areas.

**Crime:** Street crime is a significant problem in urban areas. Robbery and muggings occur on major thoroughfares and in neighborhoods, including those where expatriates and diplomatic staff live, where popular bars and restaurants are located, and on the beaches near hotels frequented by international visitors. Most reported incidents involve the use of force, by armed persons, with minor injury to the victim. There have been reports of individuals impersonating police officers.

Travelers should avoid the Dantokpa Market between the hours of dusk and dawn.

**Demonstrations** occur occasionally. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

* Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent.
* Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**International Financial Scams:**See the [Department of State](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html)and the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) pages for information.

Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Benin. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include:

* Romance/Online dating
* Money transfers
* Contracts with promises of large commissions
* Grandparent/Relative targeting
* Work permits/job offers

**Victims of Crime:** U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police at +(229) 21-30-30-25 or +(229) 21-30-20-11, and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(229) 21-30-75-00. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.

See our webpage on [help for U.S. victims of crime overseas](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/victims.html).

Those who witness or are victimized by police fraud and/or corruption can call the “Green Line” of the Beninese Police at 166 to report what they have experienced.

The U.S. Embassy can:

* Help you find appropriate medical care.
* Assist you in reporting a crime to the police.
* Contact relatives or friends with your written consent.
* Provide general information regarding the victim’s role during the local investigation and following its conclusion.
* Provide a list of local attorneys.
* Provide our information on [victim’s compensation programs in the United States.](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/victims.html)
* Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution.
* Help you find accommodation and arrange flights home.
* Replace a stolen or lost passport.

**Domestic Violence:**U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance.

**Tourism**: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is limited. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. Depending on the nature of an injury or illness, appropriate medical treatment may not be available in Benin. U.S. citizens are strongly encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).

**Beach Safety**: Swimming conditions along Benin’s coastline are dangerous due to strong tides, waves, and rip currents, and several people drown each year. Some private beaches offer increased protection, such as sea walls.  Always learn about the water conditions at any beach before attempting to swim.

**Maritime Security**: Piracy and armed robbery in the Gulf of Guinea continue to trend upwards. Pirates/armed groups operating in the region typically carry out attacks on vessels using automatic weapons. Attacks, kidnappings for ransom, and robbery of crew, passengers, and ship’s property continue to be common occurrences.
