# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

Travelers to Benin must present a valid passport and visa to enter the country. Visas are not available upon entry at the airport or at any land or sea arrival point.

Benin offers an eVisa for tourism, business, and transit travelers. An application for an eVisa can be made [online](https://evisa.gouv.bj/en/) between 7 and 90 days before you travel. The eVisa is generally valid for 30 or 90 days. However, U.S. citizens can extend the validity to 36 months without additional costs by presenting a valid eVisa and a U.S. passport to the nearest Beninese embassy or consular office. While in the United States, requests for this extension can be made at the Embassy of Benin, located at:

2124 Kalorama Road NW  
Washington, DC 20008  
Telephone:Â  202-232-6656
