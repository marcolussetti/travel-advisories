**Passport requirements**

* Your passport must be **valid for the entire length of your stay** in the United Kingdom.
* Since June 2019, U.S. passport holders can use ePassport Gates when arriving in the UK. If you previously registered for the [UK Registered Traveler Service (RTS](https://www.gov.uk/visas-immigration)), you should now use the ePassport Gates.

**Onward travel to more countries**

* Many countries require the passport to be valid for 6 months or more during travel. Review those [country pages](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages.html) if you continue your travel after leaving the UK.

**Visa requirements**

* All U.S. citizens traveling to the UK for tourism, family visits, business meetings, conferences, or short-term study for 6 months or less must have an Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA) before travel. U.S. citizens can [apply for ETAs](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-an-electronic-travel-authorisation-eta).
* As of fall 2024, UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) is working to replace physical documents with a new online record of immigration status called an eVisa.

Review the [UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI)](https://www.gov.uk/visas-immigration) information, including:

* Visa requirements for your type of travel (research, work, study, medical treatment).
* Information for unpaid and paid workers (interns, volunteers, charity, religious, and temporary workers).
* Visitor information if you plan to get married in the UK, even if you don’t plan to live there.
* Extra fees about certain visa categories related to work, study, or residency for more than 6 months.

We cannot help with your UK visa application. If denied entry, we cannot press for your admission into the UK.

**HIV/AIDS entry restrictions**

The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of the UK.
