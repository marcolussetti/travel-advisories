**Road Conditions and Safety**

UK traffic **drives on the left side** of the road, which is different from the United States

* Read the [Highway Code](https://www.gov.uk/browse/driving/highway-code-road-safety) from the UK government before driving.
* Visit the UK Government [website](https://www.gov.uk/driving-nongb-licence) to find out if your driver’s license is valid in the UK
* Emergency call boxes are orange and have “SOS” printed on them. They are found every half mile on motorways.
* Pedestrians in the UK don’t have the right of way. Do not expect vehicles to stop for you.
* Many U.S. pedestrians get injured or killed in the UK because they forget that traffic comes from the opposite direction on the street.
* Wait for crossing signs at crosswalks. Look both ways before stepping into the street.
