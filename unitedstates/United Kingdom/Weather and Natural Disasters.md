**Emergency phone numbers**

**Terrorism**

[Terrorist groups](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html) and individuals inspired by them want to attack American citizens outside of the United States. They are using simpler methods of attack like knives, guns, and vehicles to target crowds. They often go after unprotected or vulnerable targets at:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

Terrorist groups are still planning possible attacks in Europe.

* The [UK Security Service](https://www.gov.uk/terrorism-national-emergency) updates the public on any changes in the threat level and actions for the public.

There is a risk of **isolated violence** in Northern Ireland due to political tensions.

* The Police Service of Northern Ireland warns of continued threats from protester groups. These groups target police and military with firearms or explosives.
* Tensions may be higher during the summer marching season (April to August) and on the July 12th holiday.

**Crime**

Violent crimes or crimes against property are rare. U.S. citizens should take the same security precautions as in the United States or any big city.

* Be aware of your surroundings
* Be aware of pickpocketing, mugging, and “snatch and grab” theft of mobile phones, watches, and jewelry.
* Don’t leave bags unattended in restaurants, pubs, hotel lobbies, or parked cars.
* Only use [licensed black taxis or pre-ordered car services](https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/taxis-and-minicabs/) (minicabs). Unlicensed taxis or private cars can be dangerous and may lead to robbery or sexual assault.
* Avoid ATMs that look temporary or are in isolated areas. Use ATMs inside a bank branch for safety.

**Demonstrations**

Demonstrations occur frequently in cities throughout the UK.  They can:

* Result in violence or property damage.
* Be unpredictable.
* Occur outside the U.S. Embassy in London and at the U.S. Consulates in Belfast and Edinburgh.
* Occur near tourist areas in London like Hyde Park, Oxford Street, and Trafalgar Square.

Demonstration organizers must get police approval in advance. UK police are good at managing these events.

To stay safe:

* Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Use caution near any large gatherings, protests, or rallies.
* Check local media updates and traffic advisories.
* Check [Transport for London](https://tfl.gov.uk/) and the [Metropolitan Police](https://www.met.police.uk/), including their social media accounts for updates.
