# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties**

You are subject to local laws.

* If you break laws, even if you don't know them, you can be kicked out of the area, arrested, or put in prison.
* If you want to start a business or work in a job that needs special permits or licenses, you should get information from the local authorities before you start.
* Furthermore, some crimes are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law.

For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification**

If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately.

**Weapons**

The UK government provides a full list of what is prohibited when traveling to the UK.

* **[You will be arrested](https://www.gov.uk/bringing-goods-into-uk-personal-use/banned-and-restricted-goods)** if you bring the following into the UK:
  + Pocket knives
  + Blades
  + Mace
  + Tasers
  + Pepper spray canisters
  + Gun or gun parts
* The UK has very strict gun control laws. Importing firearms is very complicated. The London Metropolitan Police Firearms provides information about [applying for a firearm or shotgun certificate](https://www.met.police.uk/advice/advice-and-information/fi/af/firearms-licensing/).
* Licenses issued in England or Wales may not be valid in Scotland. Police in Scotland provide [information on certificates](https://www.scotland.police.uk/about-us/what-we-do/firearms-and-explosives-licensing/).
* Always start packing with an empty bag. This avoids bringing into the UK any prohibited items in your luggage.  The UK and British Overseas Territories has different restrictions for bullets and ammunition.Please check the restrictions for your destination before traveling.

**Alcohol**

* The legal drinking age in the UK is 18. Parents and school trip organizers should review the [students abroad](http://studentsabroad.state.gov/) information.
* Scotland has stricter [“drunk driving limit” laws](https://www.gov.uk/drink-drive-limit) compared to the rest of the UK. In Scotland, the legal blood alcohol concentration (BAC) limit is roughly 0.05, while it is 0.08 in the rest of the UK. This means driving after one drink can result in a DUI. Authorities strictly enforce penalties for being drunk on flights to and from the UK. They can lead to arrest and prison time.
* Learn more about [U.S customs rules](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/customs-and-import.html) before returning to the United States.

**Controlled substances**

UK law bans the possession and sale of controlled substances and drugs, including some that are legal in certain U.S. states.

People who violate UK drug laws may face [penalties](https://www.gov.uk/penalties-drug-possession-dealing) including fines or prison sentences.

**Travelers with disabilities**

In the UK, all public service providers must make "reasonable adjustments" for people with disabilities. This excludes transportation services.

* The law allows older buildings to follow different rules. They can have steps from the street (no ramps).
* Getting around cities can be hard because sidewalks are often narrow and uneven.
* Most [London Underground](https://tfl.gov.uk/transport-accessibility/) and [UK National Rail System](http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/passenger_services/disabled_passengers/) stations are not accessible for people with disabilities. Many stations do not have elevators and have stairways or long hallways to change trains or exit to the street.
* UK buses have lowering platforms for travelers. This helps travelers with limited mobility and sight, or hearing disabilities.
* Many taxis have swivel-entry seats or ramps to get in easier.
* "Blue badges" are parking permits for the disabled issued by local UK councils. Some councils may not offer permits to temporary visitors.
