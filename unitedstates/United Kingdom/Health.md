**Healthcare in the United Kingdom**

Medical care in the UK is widely available. In smaller cities, it may take longer for medical help to arrive and assist.

* Free treatment under the National Health System (NHS) is only available to UK residents, EU nationals, and some visa holders.
* Some visa applicants must pay an extra NHS fee when applying.
* Tourists and short-term visitors don’t pay the extra fee but will be charged 150% of the cost for any NHS treatment they receive.
* Private medical care exists, primarily in larger cities.  Often, private medical clinics do not have Emergency Departments (A&E) services.

**Medical payments and insurance**

* The U.S. government does not pay medical bills.
* The UK Government encourages tourists to make sure they are covered by personal health or travel insurance.  More information on NHS fees for tourists and short-term visitors is available on the [UK Government website.](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-the-nhs-charges-overseas-visitors-for-nhs-hospital-care/how-the-nhs-charges-overseas-visitors-for-nhs-hospital-care)
* U.S. Medicare and Medicaid do not work overseas.
* Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments.
* Make sure your health insurance plan provides [coverage overseas](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html?cq_ck=1708701048867) for reimbursement of payments. The CDC provides more information on [types of insurance available](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance).
* We recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical needs and possible evacuation.

**Prescription drugs**

* Confirm that your medication is legal according to the [UK government](https://www.gov.uk/take-medicine-in-or-out-uk). Some U.S. approved drugs are considered controlled substances in the UK and require additional license to buy, or bring into the country.
* Bring enough medicine to last your entire trip. Mailed prescriptions may be delayed or blocked by British customs.
* Take your prescription medication in the original labeled packaging.
* Bring a copy of your doctor’s prescription.

**Vaccinations**

Stay up to date on all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Air Quality**

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas. Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in [destination]. For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/). For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).
