Professional roadside assistance service is not available.

See our [Road Safety page](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/safety/road.html) for more information. 

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Comoros, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Comoros’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/).

**Maritime Travel:** Mariners planning travel to Comoros should check for U.S. maritime advisories and alerts at the [Maritime Security Communications with Industry Web Portal](http://www.marad.dot.gov/msci). Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard homeport website](https://homeport.uscg.mil/) and as a broadcast warning on the [National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency’s website](https://msi.nga.mil/NGAPortal/MSI.portal;jsessionid=JNQ7YvGFT3NyQqvhKxlxFwyk1n1DFqshyKphwwT8Nh75XyWCBQnH!2105571521!-1841564034?_nfpb=true&_st=&_pageLabel=msi_portal_page_63).

Travel between the islands by boat is common but is poorly regulated. Boats may be overcrowded and lack safety equipment resulting is capsized vessels and fatalities. Death by drowning is common. Use only commercially licensed ferry services which are equipped with adequate safety devices, and ship-to-shore communications.

**Port Security:**The Commandant of the Coast Guard has determined that effective anti-terrorism measures are not in place in Comoros ports and has imposed conditions of entry on vessels that arrive in U.S. ports having visited ports in Comoros. Mariners and passengers on commercial vessels traveling through the ports of Comoros should exercise increased caution.
