# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Convictions for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs result in a mandatory minimum five-year prison sentence and heavy fines. You may be fined or possibly imprisoned for public intoxication. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Photography:** It is illegal to take pictures of government buildings, military installations, and other key infrastructure such as ports, train stations, and airports. You could be fined, have your photographic equipment confiscated, and risk detention and arrest. Do not take photos of Comorians without permission.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information. The U.S. Embassy in Madagascar provides consular assistance; there is no full-time official U.S. presence in Comoros.

**Clothing:** Comorians dress conservatively. Shorts or short sleeves should be avoided, except at the beach.

**Phone Service:** Cellular phones are the norm, as other telephone service is unreliable and landlines are nearly non-existent. It may be possible to purchase a SIM card locally and use a GSM-compatible cell phone. Cellular data packages, at 2G or 3G speeds, are also available for purchase.

**Currency:** The Comorian Franc (KMF) is the official currency. This is a cash society; credit cards are not widely accepted. There are three banks on the island to exchange currency.

**Utilities Outages:**

* The supply of electricity is frequently disrupted, sometimes for extended periods.
* Water supplies can fluctuate (including potable water), affecting tourist and other public services.

**Faith-Based Travelers:** Reports of religious-based violence are rare. Proselytizing or the public practice of non-Sunni Muslim religious ceremonies is against the law in the Comoros. See our following webpages for details:

**LGB Travelers:** Same-sex sexual relations are criminalized in the Union of the Comoros and are punishable by up to five years’ imprisonment and a fine of up to 2,300 USD.  Seeour [LGB Travel Information](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/lgbt.html)page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:** Persons with disabilities face limited access to transportation, communication, accommodations, and public buildings. There are few sidewalks and no curb-cuts, and most buildings lack functioning elevators.

**Students:** See our [Students Abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/studentsabroad/en.html) page and [FBI travel tips](https://ucr.fbi.gov/investigate/counterintelligence/student-brochure).

**Women Travelers:** Sexual harassment is illegal and punishable by up to 10 years’ imprisonment. Such harassment is a common problem, and the government does not effectively enforce penalties against it. Rape is illegal and punishable by imprisonment for five to 10 years or up to 15 years if the victim is younger than 15 years of age. The government enforces the laws on rape with some effectiveness if survivors pursue charges.
