Comoros has experienced occasional strikes and civil unrest, resulting in violent clashes between police and demonstrators.

**Precautions:**

* Avoid demonstrations, large gatherings and any political rallies. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence.
* Follow the instructions of local authorities, monitor local news broadcasts, and [alerts](https://km.usembassy.gov/category/alert/).

**Piracy:** Small craft on the open seas are vulnerable to attack. See [MARAD's](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories) page for advisories.

**Marine hazards:** Be aware of jellyfish, coral, and sea urchins when swimming, snorkeling, or [scuba diving](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2016/the-pre-travel-consultation/scuba-diving). Currents can be strong in the Mozambique channel and riptides exist on some beaches.

**Crime:** The most commonly reported crimes are petty crimes of opportunity such as pickpocketing.

* Be vigilant, particularly when visiting crowded markets, parks, and beaches.
* Ensure personal belongings, passport, and other travel documents are secure at all times.
* Avoid walking alone, especially after dark, and displaying cash and valuable personal property.
