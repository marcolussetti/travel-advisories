# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

Visit the [Embassy of Greece](http://www.mfa.gr/usa/en/the-embassy) website for the most current visa information.

**Greece is a party to the Schengen Agreement;** therefore, U.S. citizens may enter Greece without a visa for stays of up to 90 days for tourism or business purposes. For additional details about travel into and within Schengen countries, please see our [Schengen fact sheet](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/schengen-fact-sheet.html).

* For entry into Greece, your passport should have at least **six months of remaining validity**. While Greek law requires three months of passport validity beyond the intended date of your departure, if you are transiting a country that requires six months of validity, you may not be permitted to continue your trip. We recommend that you have at least six months of validity to avoid any travel disruptions.
* U.S. citizens traveling on a passport reported lost or stolen will not be permitted entry into Greece and may be returned to their original departure point. This decision is the purview of the Greek immigration authorities; the U.S. Embassy cannot intervene. Emergency passports are issued only at the Embassy in Athens. Staff members do not travel to the air, land, or sea ports of entry.
* You must arrive in country with proof of sufficient funds and a return airline ticket or other evidence that you will depart Greece if asked. The sufficient funds requirement is often met with credit cards.
* **U.S. official and diplomatic passport holders** must obtain a Schengen visa prior to arrival. If you are traveling on a U.S. official or diplomatic passport, you will not be allowed to enter Greece without a visa.
* **If traveling on official military orders**, review the guidance in the [Department of Defense Foreign Clearance Guide](https://www.fcg.pentagon.mil/).

**If you are a U.S. citizen with a passport listing your place of birth as the Northern Republic of Macedonia, the Greek authorities will stamp your passport.**

**If you are a U.S. citizen with a passport listing your place of birth as Skopje or the Republic of Macedonia,** your U.S. passport should be recognized as a valid travel document. However, be aware:

* Greek Immigration officers at ports of entry (land, air, and sea) will not place entry stamps in a passport listing the travelerâ€™s place of birth as Macedonia or the Republic of Macedonia.
* You will be asked to complete a short form on which the entry stamp will be placed.
* Keep the form with your passport while you are in Greece and present it upon departure. If you lose the form, you must visit a police station and file a report before the Greek authorities will permit you to depart the country.

**HIV/AIDS RESTRICTIONS:** The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Greece.
