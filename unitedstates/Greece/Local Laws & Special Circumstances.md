# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Possession of a U.S. passport will not prevent you from being arrested, prosecuted, or jailed.

* Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. Marijuana is illegal in Greece.
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs could land you immediately in jail.
* Photographing military installations is prohibited and may lead to arrest.
* Mace or pepper-spray canisters are illegal in Greece. Such items will be confiscated, and police may arrest or detain you.
* Carry your passport or some form of photo identification at all times. Police may detain you for questioning if you do not have proper identification with you.

Some crimes are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ceos/citizens-guide-us-federal-law-extraterritorial-sexual-exploitation-children) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

**Faith-Based Travelers:** See our webpages for details:

**Greek Antiquities:** Customs authorities strictly regulate the export of Greek antiquities, including rocks from archaeology sites. Do not remove anything, no matter how small, from archaeological or historical sites. Do not purchase protected antiquities and carry receipts for any purchases that may appear to be antiquities.

**Military Service for Dual Nationals:**

* Greek males between 19 and 45 are required to perform military service.
* If the Greek government considers you to be a Greek citizen, you may be required to fulfill this obligation whether or not you consider yourself Greek or possess a U.S. or third country’s passport.
* Authorities can prevent you from leaving Greece until you complete your [military obligations](https://gr.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/local-resources-of-u-s-citizens/military-obligations/). Contact the [Greek embassy or nearest Greek consulate](http://www.mfa.gr/usa/en/) with questions.
* Generally, required military service will not affect your U.S. citizenship, but contact [U.S. Embassy Athens](mailto:AthensAmericanPassports@state.gov) if you have questions.

**LGB Travelers:** There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Greece. LGB individuals in Greece are protected by anti-discrimination laws; however, non-governmental organizations report that social discrimination based on sexual orientation is widespread in Greece and violence against LGB individuals remains a problem.

Seeour [LGB travel information](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/lgbt.html) page and section six of our [Human Rights Report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:** While Greek law prohibits discrimination against persons with physical or intellectual disabilities and local law requires access to buildings, sidewalks, and public transportation, application and enforcement of these laws is lacking.

* Handicapped parking spaces and sidewalk ramps are often occupied or blocked by parked vehicles.
* Sidewalks often are narrow with broken paving stones and large holes and obstructed by trees and street signs.
* Buildings with ramps might lack accessible elevators or bathrooms.
* A small percentage of public buildings (primarily in Athens) have full accessibility. Some buildings and intersections include accommodations for visually-impaired travelers.
* The Athens metro and Athens International Airport are fully accessible with ramps and elevators.
* Ask your hotel about accessibility before booking.

[The Deputy Ombudsman for Social Welfare](http://www.synigoros.gr/?i=stp.en.how) handles complaints related to persons with disabilities, especially those related to employment, social security, and transportation.
