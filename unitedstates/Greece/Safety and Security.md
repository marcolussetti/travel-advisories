# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:** Credible information indicates terrorist groups continue plotting possible near-term attacks in Europe. All European countries remain potentially vulnerable to attacks from transnational terrorist organizations. In the past year, there have been multiple terrorist attacks in Europe. Extremists continue to focus on tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and local government facilities as viable targets. In addition, hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, parks, high-profile events, educational institutions, airports, and other soft targets remain priority locations for possible attacks. U.S. citizens should exercise additional vigilance in these and similar locations.

For more information, see our [*Terrorism*](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html) page.

**Strikes and Demonstrations:**

* Domestic strikes, demonstrations, and work stoppages are common throughout Greece and can become violent. Stay informed through local news, hotel security, the U.S. [Embassy website](https://gr.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/security-and-travel-information/), and the [Consular Section’s Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Consular-Section-US-Embassy-Athens/149676861734131). Enroll in [STEP](https://step.state.gov/) to receive alerts sent by the Embassy.
* Transportation sector strikes interrupt traffic, public transportation, taxis, seaports, and airports. Confirm domestic and international flights before heading to the airport.
* Avoid all areas affected by the annual November 17 demonstrations, including the U.S. Embassy.
* Anarchists and criminals have used university campuses as refuges. Demonstrators frequently congregate in the Polytechnic University area, Exarchia, Omonia, and Syntagma Squares in Athens; and at Aristotle Square, Aristotle University, and the Kamara area in Thessaloniki.
* Violent anarchist groups have joined public demonstrations to clash with police and vandalize public and private property.

**Crime:** Crimes against tourists, such as **pick-pocketing** and **purse-snatching**, occur at popular tourist sites and on public transportation, especially the metro. A common tactic is one person causes a commotion on the metro or pushes travelers to distract them while another person snatches the belongings. Thieves also seek out and break into rental cars to steal passports, valuables, and luggage. The Embassy has received reports of alcohol-induced attacks targeting individual tourists at some holiday resorts and bars.

Take the following precautions:

* Be cautious and aware of your surroundings.
* Do not leave bags unattended, especially on the metro and the Athens Airport train or in your vehicle.
* Avoid standing near bus or train doors. Thieves often strike as the doors open then disappear into the crowd.
* Use alcohol in moderation and remain in control.
* Never leave drinks unattended in bars or clubs.
* Be discreet when discussing plans and organizing belongings upon arrival.
* Protect yourself and your money by using well-lit, public ATMs.
* Be aware of internet scams with online thieves posing as loved ones or romantic interests.

**Tremors and earthquakes** occur regularly. **Forest fires** are common, especially during the dry summer months, and occasionally cause road closures.

Contact the General Secretariat for Civil Protection, which responds to emergencies, at 210-335-9900 for more information. Operators speak English. Monitor the [U.S. Embassy Athens’ website](https://gr.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/) and [Consular Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/ConsularSectionUSEmbassyAthens/).

**Tourism**: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities, such as Athens or Thessaloniki. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
