# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you break local laws, even if you don't know it, you can be kicked out of the area, arrested, or put in prison. If you want to start a business or work in a job that needs special permits or licenses, you should get information from the local authorities before you start.

Furthermore, some crimes are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, review our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. Review our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

**Conditions at the Bangkok Immigration Detention Center (IDC):** Conditions in immigration detention centers (IDCs), where authorities detain foreign nationals who violate immigration laws, remain poor and most are overcrowded. IDCs, administered by the Thai Immigration Bureau, which reports to the Royal Thai Police (RTP), are not subject to many of the regulations that govern the regular prison system. U.S. citizen detainees often complain of stark unhealthy living conditions and significant overcrowding. Personal security is poor. In addition, the IDC facilities throughout Thailand can only provide very basic health care. Deportations are self-funded, and it may take up to 2 weeks for Thai authorities to process a case before deportation. Detainees must have funds to purchase a phone card and do not have access to the internet. Prior approval and a security escort are required to visit a Western Union or an ATM machine.

* Please see the [Department of State’s Report on Human Rights Practices for Thailand](https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/528267_THAILAND-2023-HUMAN-RIGHTS-REPORT.pdf) for further information.

**Lèse majesté (Royal Insult):**Making a critical or defamatory comment about the royal family is punishable by a prison sentence of up to 15 years per offense. As an example, purposely tearing Thai bank notes, which carry an image of the King, may be considered a lèse majesté offense.

**Prostitution is illegal in Thailand.**Serious consequences include criminal conviction and imprisonment, particularly for child prostitution.

**Personal use of even non-lethal military equipment, such as protective vests and night vision scopes, is prohibited.**

**Illegal drugs**carry severe penalties. Expect long jail sentences under harsh conditions, heavy fines, or even execution for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs. Please visit the Royal Thai Government’s [Office of the Narcotics Control Board](https://www.oncb.go.th/) for more information. Also please note that some prescription medication from the United States is not legal to possess under Thai law. Please see “Medication for Personal Use” in the Health Section.

**Shoplifting**can result in large fines and lengthy detention followed by deportation.

**Defamation Laws:** Thailand has strict laws concerning publicly “defaming” or ‘damaging’ the reputation of a person or business, which can include leaving a negative review on a public website, punishable with civil and/or criminal penalties.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries. They may be illegal according to local laws.  Counterfeit and pirated goods may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety.  You may be subject to fines and/or have to give up counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States.  Review the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection website](https://www.cbp.gov/trade/fakegoodsrealdangers#:~:text=It%20is%20illegal%20to%20purchase%20counterfeit%20goods.%20Bringing,activities%2C%20such%20as%20forced%20labor%20or%20human%20trafficking.) and [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-ccips) for more information.

**LGB Travelers:**There are no known legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Thailand. However, LGB groups report that in the case of sexual crimes, police tend to downplay sexual abuse claims from LGB victims.

Seeour [LGB Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgb.html)page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:**The law in Thailand prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, intellectual or mental disabilities, and the law is sporadically enforced.

Sidewalks and street crossings are not suitable for travelers with mobility issues. Newly constructed buildings, facilities, and transportation equipment should be accessible by law for persons with mobility issues. However, enforcement of these provisions is not uniform.

Rental, repair, and replacement parts for mobility aids, medical equipment medical devices and service providers are available in Bangkok and other major cities but are rare outside major metropolitan areas.

**Women Travelers:** Victims of sexual assault or domestic violence may find that Thai authorities do not handle such cases with as much sensitivity or consideration for privacy as they would expect in the United States.
