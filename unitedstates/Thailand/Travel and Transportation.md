# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:**

* **Traffic accidents are common in Thailand.** According to the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241565684), Thailand had one of the world’s highest traffic-related fatality rates. Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Phuket, and other major cities can have heavy traffic.
* **Reckless driving:** Speeding, reckless passing, and failure to obey other traffic laws are common in Thailand. Traffic moves on the left. Some drivers move illegally against the traffic. Scooters and motorbikes commonly drive on the sidewalks during rush hour and other periods of heavy traffic. Commercial drivers commonly consume alcohol, amphetamines, and other stimulants.
* **Accidents involving motorcycles can be deadly**. Riders may incur serious injuries when not wearing helmets or proper clothing and footwear. In 2024, multiple U.S. citizens died in traffic accidents involving riders of 2- and 3-wheeled vehicles in Thailand. Use of motorcycle helmets is mandatory, but this law is sporadically enforced.
* **Use a pedestrian bridge** to cross the road where one is available, including in front of the U.S. Embassy on Wireless Road and on Sukhumvit Road, where many pedestrians have been killed and several U.S. citizens seriously injured. Look carefully in both directions before crossing streets, even when using a marked crosswalk.
* **If you have a traffic accident,** you should contact your insurance company for guidance in dealing with the other party and the police.
* **Emergency vehicles:** Congested roads and a scarcity of ambulances can make it difficult for accident victims to receive timely medical attention

**Traffic Laws:**

* **Driving under influence is punishable by law**. If you are found to be intoxicated, you could be jailed for a minimum of two years and subject to a fine.
* **Bribes are illegal.**If you are found guilty, you could be imprisoned up to five years, face severe fines, or both.
* **The following violations are also subject to a fine:**
  + Lack of ID.
  + Not obeying traffic laws and traffic signals.
  + Driving slowly in regular lanes of traffic.

**Public Transportation:**

* **Mass transit:** In Bangkok, the Bangkok Mass Transit System (BTS) elevated "Skytrain," “Airport Rail Link” mass transit, and the underground Metropolitan Rapid Transit (MRT) systems are reliable, inexpensive, air conditioned, and often faster than Bangkok traffic.
* **Bus system:** Bangkok also has an extensive bus system, but buses can be overcrowded and are often driven with little or no regard for passenger safety.
* **For hire vehicles:** Cities outside of Bangkok typically have only rudimentary public transportation and usually do not have metered taxis. In many cases, motorcycle taxis, tuk-tuks, bicycle-powered rickshaws, and pick-up trucks will be the only options available for travelers without their own transport.
* **Smartphone-based for-hire vehicle service** exists in Bangkok and other large cities. Those affiliated with registered taxis, such as Grab Taxi, Line Taxi, and All Thai Taxi are legal, but their affiliated car services are under legal review.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has found that Thailand’s Civil Aviation Authority does not meet international standards for aviation safety oversight. FAA’s [website](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa) includes more information on its assessment program.

**Maritime Travel:**Mariners and passengers planning travel to Thailand should check for U.S. Maritime [advisories](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories) and [alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts).  Information may also be posted to the  [U.S. Coast Guard Homeport](https://mmcvqr.uscg.mil/missions) website, and the [NGA Navigational Warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings)website.”
