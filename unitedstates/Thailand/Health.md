**For emergency services in Thailand, dial 1669 for Emergency Medical Services (EMS).**

Ambulance services are:

* Not present throughout the country or are unreliable in most areas except in Bangkok and other major cities.
* Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

**Medical treatment** is generally adequate in Thailand’s urban areas. In Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Phuket, and Pattaya, good facilities exist for routine, long-term, and emergency health care. Basic medical care is available in rural areas and on islands, but English-speaking providers are rare.

**The Department of State, U.S. embassies and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:**Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on types of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

·        The Department of State strongly recommends [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html?cq_ck=1708701048867) to cover medical evacuation.

**Medicine for personal use:** Up to a 30-day supply may be brought into the country with you. . Do not mail medicine to Thailand without first confirming it will be allowed into the country.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription. Check with [Thailand Customs](https://www.customs.go.th/list_strc_simple_neted.php?ini_content=individual_160503_03_160905_01&lang=en&left_menu=menu_individual_submenu_01_160421_01) and the [Thailand Food and Drug Administration](https://en.fda.moph.go.th/) to ensure the medication is legal in Thailand.

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Air Quality:** The air quality in Thailand varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons, but seasonal smog is a problem. In recent years the air quality in Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Khon Kaen, Lampang, Nan, and Samut Sakhon have exceeded Thai and U.S. government daily standards for fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) for a portion of the year. In Chiang Mai and other northern provinces, annual agricultural burning, approximately February through late April, and forest fires cause days with unhealthy to hazardous air quality based on the U.S. index. In Bangkok environs, airborne dust and auto pollutants are prevalent in the cooler, dry period (December-February).Anyone who travels where pollution levels are high is at risk. People at the greatest risk from air pollution exposure include:

* Infants, children, and teens
* People over 65 years of age
* People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema.
* People with heart disease or diabetes
* People who work or are active outdoors

For Bangkok and Chiang Mai, U.S. Mission Thailand is reporting the U.S. EPA’s Air Quality Index (AQI) calculated from PM2.5 data captured by monitors owned and maintained by the Royal Thai Government. The information and advice on health protection measures to take is available

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.

* Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in Thailand.
* For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/).
* For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Thailand.html#ExternalPopup).

**Doctors and Hospitals:** The U.S. Embassy maintains [a list of doctors and hospitals](https://th.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/local-resources-of-u-s-citizens/medical-emergencies/). We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.

**Health facilities in general:**

* Adequate health facilities are available in Bangkok and other major cities but health care in rural areas and on islands may be below U.S. standards.
* Hospitals and doctors require payment “up front” prior to service or admission. Credit card payment is not always available.
* Medical staff at public hospitals may speak little or no English.
* Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals.
* Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions.

**Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery:**

* Medical tourism is a fast-growing industry. If you want healthcare in another country, you need to know that their medical systems are different from the United States. They don't follow the same rules. Before you travel for medical reasons, talk to your doctor.
* Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Medical Tourism website](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/medical-tourism) for information on Medical Tourism. Find out about the risks of medical tourism and what you can do to prepare before traveling to Thailand.
* We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications.
* Your legal options in case of malpractice are very limited in Thailand.
* Although Thailand has many elective/cosmetic surgery facilities that are on par with those found in the United States, the quality of care varies widely. If you plan to undergo surgery in Thailand, make sure that emergency medical facilities are available and professionals are accredited and qualified.

**Pharmaceuticals:**

* Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with little controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments.
* U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration have rules for bringing medication back to the United States. Medication bought abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back. The medication must be for personal use and approved for use in the United States. Visit the websites of [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/fda-drug-info-rounds-video/traveling-prescription-medications) for more information.

**Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy:**

* If you are considering traveling to Thailand to have a child through use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) or surrogacy, please see our [ART and Surrogacy Abroad page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Assisted-Reproductive-Technology-ART-Surrogacy-Abroad.html).
* Surrogacy is illegal for foreigners in Thailand, subject to complex local regulation. For additional information, visit the [Government of Thailand’s website](https://www.thaigov.go.th/main/contents) for information on foreigner surrogacy.

**Water Quality and Food Safety:**

* In many areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.
