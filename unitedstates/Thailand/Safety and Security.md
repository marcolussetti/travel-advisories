**Far Southern Thailand:** Periodic violence between Thai security services and armed insurgents occurs in Thailand’s 3 southernmost provinces—Yala, Pattani and Narathiwat. Seventeen districts in these provinces remain under a declared state of emergency due to ongoing violent conflict. There is a collateral risk of violence for U.S. citizens in Thailand’s southernmost provinces due to low intensity conflict. The main dangers for U.S. citizens in these southernmost provinces are from improvised explosive devices and small arms.

The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in these provinces as U.S government employees must obtain special authorization to travel to these provinces.

**Crime:**

* **Crimes of opportunity,** such as pick-pocketing, bag-snatching, and burglary, occur in Thailand.
* **Violent crimes** against foreigners are relatively rare. However, murders, rapes, and assaults against foreigners do occur.
* **Sexually motivated violence** is most likely to occur after time spent at bars, clubs, and parties, on beaches, or in remote/isolated areas. Sexual assault victims should make a police report in the jurisdiction where the crime occurred. You may also want to contact the Embassy and hire a local attorney.
* **When traveling alone,** exercise caution, stay near other travelers, and ensure friends or family know how to contact you.
* **Taxi and “tuk-tuk”** drivers may attempt to charge excessive fares or refuse passengers. You should either request the driver use the meter or agree on the fare beforehand.
* **At the airport** use only public transportation from the airport’s official pick-up area, cars from the limousine counters, rail links (where applicable), or a car from your hotel.
* **Rental scams** occur in Thailand. Many rental motorbike, jet ski, and car companies will hold your passport until you pay for real or fictitious damages. Do not use your passport as collateral.
* **Exorbitant bar tab scams** occur in Thailand. Some bars and entertainment venues will charge exorbitant prices for drinks or unadvertised cover charges and threaten violence if you don’t pay.
* **Other scams** involving gems, city tours, entertainment venues, and credit cards are common, especially in tourist areas.
* **Self-purported visa brokers** will offer to take passports on “visa runs” to neighboring countries to “stamp out/stamp in” travelers to reset their 60-day visa-free travel or offer to obtain a visa for U.S. citizens in ways that do not conform to Thai law. We do not recommend handing your passport over to unknown individuals.

**Scams:** Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Thailand. Review the Department of State’s [Protecting Yourself from Scams](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) pages for information.

Be careful when using dating apps or online dating websites while abroad. Scammers may target U.S. citizens. Tell your friends and family where you are, meet in a popular public place, and avoid consuming suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs.

Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Tips to avoid scammers:

* Look for red flags like their location is far away, their profile was recently created or seems to be too good to be true, the pace of the relationship is moving too quickly, or they ask for money.
* Set up a phone call/video chat in the initial stages.
* Do a reverse image search on the profile picture.
* If they ask for help, you should refer to them to the closest U.S. Embassy or Consulate so we can work with local authorities to assist.
* If you believe you have been scammed, report the incident to local law enforcement right away and stop all communications with the scammer.

**Technology Usage Abroad:** Mobile devices are vulnerable to compromise, theft, and physical damage anywhere in the world. Best practices prior to traveling abroad are keeping all software (operating system and apps) updated and use virtual private network (VPN) and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications if possible. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi.

GPS Navigation Apps are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using the GPS app make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. GPS navigation app may give you the shortest route without safety consideration.

**Victims of Crime:**U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy or Consulate for assistance. Report crimes to the local police by calling 191 or the Tourist Police at 1155 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +66 (0) 2-205-4049 or Consulate at +(66) (53) 107-777. Local officials are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.

**Domestic Violence:**U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy or Consulate for assistance.

Local police are reluctant to become involved in domestic issues. You may call the Social Help Center hotline by dialing 1300 from any Thai phone.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is not well regulated. Safety inspections for equipment and facilities are rare. Dangerous areas/activities are not always labeled properly. Staff may not be trained or certified by the host government or recognized authorities. If you get injured, you will likely only find appropriate medical treatment in or near major cities. First responders cannot reach areas outside major cities to provide urgent medical care. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
