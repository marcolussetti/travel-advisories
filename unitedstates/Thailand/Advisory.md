***The advisory level was increased to Level 2. An area of increased risk was added. The advisory summary was updated.***

Exercise increased caution in Thailand due to risk of **unrest**. Some areas have increased risk.  Read the entire Travel Advisory.

**Do Not Travel to**:

* Areas along the Cambodian and Thai border due to **armed conflict.**

**Advisory summary**:   
Exercise increased caution due to **civil unrest**associated with ongoing insurgent activities in the Yala, Pattani, and Narathiwat provinces.  
  
Periodic violence between Thai security services and armed insurgents has been known to occur in Thailand’s three southernmost provinces of Yala, Pattani, and Narathiwat. Seventeen districts in these provinces remain under a declared state of emergency due to ongoing violent conflict. There is a collateral risk of violence for U.S. citizens in Thailand’s southernmost provinces due to low intensity conflict.

The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in these provinces as U.S government employees must obtain special authorization to travel to these provinces.

**Level 4 - Do Not Travel  
Thailand - Cambodia Border:**

Do not travel to areas within 50km of the Thai-Cambodian border due to **ongoing fighting** between Thai and Cambodian military forces.  
  
There are reports of fighting, including rocket and artillery fire, between Cambodian and Thai forces along the border.  Armed conflict has led to civilian casualties, and the Thai government has ordered the evacuation of certain areas. There is a collateral risk of violence, and U.S. citizens are advised to avoid all but essential travel to within 50km of these border areas until further notice.  The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in these provinces due to the ongoing risk of armed conflict.
