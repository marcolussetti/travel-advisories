***Updated to reflect lower travel advisory level for some provinces in Thailand.***

Exercise normal precautions in Thailand. Some areas have increased risk.  Read the entire Travel Advisory.

**Exercise Increased Caution to:**

* Yala, Pattani, Narathiwat, and Songkhla provinces due to **civil unrest** associated with ongoing insurgent activities.

Read the [country information page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Thailand.html) for additional information on travel to Thailand.

If you decide to travel to Thailand:

* Have evacuation plans that do not rely on U.S. government assistance.
* Enroll in the [Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)](https://step.state.gov/step/) to receive Alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.
* Review the [Country Security Report](https://www.osac.gov/Content/Report/33ef53fa-45cf-409c-8398-1c49361d4481) for Thailand.
* Prepare a contingency plan for emergency situations. Review the [Traveler’s Checklist](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/checklist.html).
* Visit the CDC page for the latest [Travel Health Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/thailand-travel-advisory.html#ExternalPopup) related to your travel.
* We highly recommend that you buy insurance before you travel. Check with your [travel insurance provider](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) about evacuation assistance, medical insurance, and trip cancellation coverage.

**Yala, Pattani, and Narathiwat Provinces – Level 2:  Exercise Increased Caution**

Periodic violence between Thai security services and armed insurgents has been known to occur in Thailand’s three southernmost provinces of Yala, Pattani, and Narathiwat.  Seventeen districts in these provinces remain under a declared state of emergency due to ongoing violent conflict.  There is a collateral risk of violence for U.S. citizens in Thailand’s southernmost provinces due to low intensity conflict.

The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in these provinces as U.S government employees must obtain special authorization to travel to these provinces.
