We strongly recommend that your passport be valid for at least six months beyond the date of your arrival in Thailand to avoid possible denied entry.
* Thai immigration officials or airline staff may ask for your onward/return ticket or financial ability to remain in Thailand.
* Business travelers, U.S. government employees travelling on official business, teachers, retirees, and those planning to stay longer than 60 days should check with the [Royal Thai Embassy about visa requirements](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Thailand.html#ExternalPopup).
* If you overstay your visa, you will be fined. Depending on the length of overstay, you may also be arrested, detained, deported at your own expense, and banned from re-entering Thailand.

We strongly recommend you always carry a digital or physical copy of your U.S. passport identification page and current Thai visa while in Thailand to help avoid detention by the Thai immigration police.
