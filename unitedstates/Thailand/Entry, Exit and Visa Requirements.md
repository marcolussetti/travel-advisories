[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

Visit the [Royal Thai Embassy](https://washingtondc.thaiembassy.org/en/page/visa-information) website for the most current visa information.

* U.S. citizen tourists entering Thailand for fewer than 60 days do not require a visa.
* We strongly recommend that your passport be valid for at least six months beyond the date of your arrival in Thailand to avoid possible denied entry.
* Thai immigration officials or airline staff may ask for your onward/return ticket.
* Business travelers, U.S. government employees travelling on official business, teachers, retirees, and those planning to stay longer than 30 days should check with the [Royal Thai Embassy about visa requirements](https://washingtondc.thaiembassy.org/en/page/visa-information).
* If you overstay your visa, you will be fined. Depending on the length of overstay, you may also be arrested, detained, deported at your own expense, and banned from re-entering Thailand.

We strongly recommend you carry a copy of your U.S. passport identification page and current Thai visa to help avoid detention by the Thai immigration police.
