# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

Before traveling to Russia, consider the current Travel Advisory.

**Do not travel to Russia** **due to:**

* Danger associated with the continuing war between Russia and Ukraine.
* The risk of harassment or wrongful detention by Russian security officials.
* The arbitrary enforcement of local laws.
* The possibility of terrorism.

**U.S. citizens in Russia should leave immediately.**The U.S. government has limited ability to help U.S. citizens in Russia, especially outside of Moscow. The U.S. Embassy in Moscow has reduced its staff and the Russian government has restricted travel for embassy personnel. All U.S. consulates in Russia have suspended operations, including consular services.

**Do not travel to Russia for any reason.**The U.S. Embassy in Moscow has limited ability to assist in the case of a detention of a U.S. citizen. There is no guarantee that detained U.S. citizens will be afforded consular access or released before their entire prison sentence is served. The risk of wrongful detention of U.S. nationals remains high. Even if the detention is determined to be wrongful, there is no guarantee of release.

Russian officials have questioned and threatened U.S. citizens without reason. Russian security services have arrested U.S. citizens on false charges. They have denied them fair treatment and convicted them without credible evidence.

Russian authorities strictly enforce all visa and immigration laws. The [Embassy of the Russian Federation](https://washington.mid.ru/en/consular-services/citizens-usa/visa-to-russia/) website provides the most up-to- date information regarding visa regulations. In accordance with Russia’s Entry-Exit Law, Russian authorities may deny entry or reentry into Russia for five years or more and cancel the visas of foreigners who have committed two administrative violations within the past three years. Activities that are not specifically covered by the traveler’s visa may result in an administrative violation and deportation.

**Dual Nationals:** Russia will **not** recognize your U.S. citizenship if you are a dual U.S.-Russian citizen or have a claim to Russian citizenship.

* Russia has blocked U.S. consular officers from visiting detained dual U.S.-Russian citizens.
* The Russian government has forced people with dual citizenship to join the military and has stopped them from leaving the country.
* In 2022, Russia started drafting citizens for the war in Ukraine. The military draft is ongoing.
* U.S.-Russian dual nationals and Russian citizens who are Lawful Permanent Residents of the United States must register their dual nationality/foreign residency with Russian authorities.  Dual U.S.-Russian citizens who have not registered have been arrested.
* U.S.-Russian dual nationals must both enter and exit Russia on a Russian passport.  You will not be permitted to depart on an expired Russian passport.  Applying for a new Russian passport can take several months.
* U.S.-Russian dual nationals who return to Russia on a “Repatriation Certificate” are only permitted to enter Russia and will not be permitted to depart Russia until they obtain a valid Russian passport.
* Minors who also have Russian citizenship and are traveling alone or in the company of adults who are not their parents must carry a Russian passport as well as their parents’ notarized consent for the trip.  Parents can contact a Russian embassy or consulate or a U.S. notary public to notarize a letter of consent. If you use a U.S. notary public, then the notarized document must be apostilled (authenticated), translated into Russian, and properly affixed. Russian authorities will prevent Russian citizen minors from entering or leaving Russia if they cannot present a properly notarized consent letter.
