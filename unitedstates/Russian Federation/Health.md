Private medical care in major metropolitan cities and tourism centers in Russia is often equal to Western standards. However, medical care is generally below Western standards in non-metropolitan areas.

Private medical facilities require payment before providing services. **Payment is expected at the time of service.**

Ambulance services are widely available but training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.

Review our [Health Abroad page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad.html) for more information. **The Department of State, U.S. embassies, and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Prescription Medication:**

* Certain classes of over-the-counter cold medicines, such as those containing pseudoephedrine, are illegal in Russia.  Do not bring cold medication with you to Russia.
* Russia does not recognize medical marijuana or CBD prescriptions. If you bring medical marijuana or CBD products, with or without THC, into Russia, you are at risk of arrest.
* Carry a copy of valid U.S. prescriptions, including a notarized translation into Russian of each prescription, when entering Russia with prescription medications.
* Prescription medication should be in its original packaging.

**Medical Insurance:**Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments.
