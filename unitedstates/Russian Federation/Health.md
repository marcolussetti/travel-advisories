Private medical care in major metropolitan cities and tourism centers in Russia is often equal to Western standards. However, medical care is generally below Western standards in non-metropolitan areas.

* Private medical facilities require payment before providing services. They will not accept U.S. insurance as a guarantee of future payment unless it's for life-threatening care. Payment is expected at the time of service.
* **The U.S. Department of State cannot pay the medical bills of private U.S. citizens.**
* **U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not provide coverage outside the United States without the purchase of supplemental coverage.**
* Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance coverage.
* **Elderly travelers and those with existing health problems are particularly at risk.**

**Prescription Medication:**

* Certain classes of over-the-counter cold medicines, such as those containing pseudoephedrine, are illegal in Russia. Do not bring cold medication with you to Russia.
* Russia does not recognize medical marijuana prescriptions. Possession of marijuana in Russia is illegal. If you bring medical marijuana into Russia, you are at risk of arrest.
* Carry a copy of valid U.S. prescriptions, including a notarized translation into Russian of each prescription, when entering Russia with prescription medications.
* Prescription medication should be in its original packaging.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/russia) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Air Quality:**Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas. Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in [destination]. For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/). For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).
