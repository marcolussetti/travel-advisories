# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Arrest Notification:** Russia routinely fails to meet its obligation to inform the U.S. Embassy of arrests of U.S. citizens. If you are detained, ask the police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. If you are a U.S.-Russian dual citizen, the police or prison officials may refuse to contact the U.S. Embassy on your behalf. Your U.S. passport does not protect you from arrest or prosecution. See our for further information.

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to all Russian laws while in Russia. If you violate these laws, even unknowingly, you may be arrested, fined, imprisoned, or expelled, and may be banned from re-entering Russia.

Some acts committed outside the United States are prosecutable as crimes in the United StatesFor examples, see [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-ccips) website.

* You can be arrested, detained, fined, deported, and banned for five years or more if you are found to have **violated Russian immigration law.**
* Penalties for**possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs** in Russia are severe. Convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.
* You can be **detained for not carrying your passport**with you.
* You can be jailed immediately for driving under the influence of alcohol.
* It is **illegal to pay for goods and services in U.S. dollars**, except at authorized retail establishments.
* You can be arrested for attempting to **leave the country with antiques**, even if they were legally purchased from licensed vendors. Travelers seeking to leave Russia with items like artwork, icons, samovars, and rugs, military medal, or antiques must possess official Russian certificates showing that they lack historical or cultural value. You may obtain certificates from the [Russian Ministry of Culture](http://government.ru/en/department/27/events/).
* **Retain all receipts** for high-value items, including caviar.
* You must have **advance approval to bring satellite telephones to Russia.**
* **Global Positioning System (GPS) and other radio electronic devices, and their use, are subject to special rules and regulations in Russia.** Contact the Russian Customs Service for required permissions.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-ccips) for more information.

**Faith-Based Travelers:** Russian authorities have arrested, fined, and even deported travelers for religious activities. The Russian government recognizes four religions: Orthodox Christianity, Judaism, Islam, and Buddhism. There are strict regulations on religious missionary work of any kind. To engage in missionary work, travelers must obtain authorization from a recognized religious group. Proselytizing outside of a registered place of worship is illegal. U.S. citizens have been detained for religious activities not allowed on tourist or humanitarian visas. See the [Department of State’s International Religious Freedom Report](https://www.state.gov/reports/2022-report-on-international-religious-freedom/).

**LGB Travelers:** Russian law bans distributing "LGB propaganda,” and the Russian Supreme Court has declared the so-called “international LGB movement” an extremist organization, effectively prohibiting all expression related to LGB issues.

Discrimination based on sexual orientation is widespread in Russia. Acts of violence and harassment targeting LGB individuals occur.

Government officials have made derogatory comments about LGB persons and violence against the LGB community continues.

There have been credible reports of arrest, torture, and extrajudicial killing of LGB persons in Chechnya allegedly conducted by Chechen regional authorities.

**Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:** Getting around in Russia is often difficult for persons with mobility issues. In general, public transportation is not accommodating to people with disabilities. The Moscow Metro, though extremely safe and efficient in other areas, is generally not accessible to persons with disabilities.

* Sidewalks are narrow and uneven.
* Mobility is usually easier in major cities such as Moscow and St. Petersburg.
* Crossing streets in large cities can be difficult, since it usually requires the use of a pedestrian underpass. These underpasses include stairs, steep ramps, and no elevators.
