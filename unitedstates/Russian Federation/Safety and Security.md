# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:** Terrorist groups, transnational and local terrorist organizations, and lone actors inspired by extremist ideology and messaging continue plotting possible attacks in Russia. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning. They may target tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, local government facilities, hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, parks, major sporting and cultural events, educational institutions, airports, and other public areas.

Terrorists have carried out attacks in Russia, including Moscow and St. Petersburg, and bomb threats against public venues are common. If you are at a location that receives a bomb threat, follow all instructions from the local police and security services.

**North Caucasus Region:** A risk of civil and political unrest continues throughout the North Caucasus region including Chechnya, North Ossetia, Ingushetia, Dagestan, Stavropol, Karachayevo-Cherkessiya, and Kabardino-Balkariya. Local criminal gangs have kidnapped foreigners, including U.S. citizens, for ransom. In the Republic of Chechnya, local authorities may harbor particular hostility towards U.S. travelers.

* Do not travel to Chechnya or any other areas in the North Caucasus region.
* If you reside in these areas, **depart immediately.**
* **U.S. government employees under Embassy (Chief of Mission) security responsibility are prohibited from traveling to the region,**due to ongoing security concerns.
* The U.S. government has no ability to assist U.S. citizens in the North Caucasus Region.

**Mt. Elbrus:**

**Do not attempt to climb Mt. Elbrus**, as individuals must pass close to volatile and insecure areas of the North Caucasus region.

**Crimea:**

* **Do not travel** to this Russian occupied territory of Ukraine.
* The U.S. government is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Crimea. Contact the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv for questions regarding consular services.
* U.S. government employees under Embassy (Chief of Mission) security responsibility are prohibited from traveling to Crimea. See the Department’s [Travel Advisory for Ukraine](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/ukraine-travel-advisory.html).

**Harassment:** Harassment of U.S.-based religious and student groups can take place in Russia, and you should be aware of the possibility of anti-U.S. sentiment or harassment. U.S. citizens, including current and former U.S. government and military personnel, may be subject to additional scrutiny by Russian security services. Remain alert, avoid any protests or demonstrations, and use discretion when commenting publicly on political developments. You can find safety and security [Alerts on the Embassy’s website](https://ru.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/security-and-travel-information/).

* Police do not need to show probable cause in order to stop, question, or detain individuals. Please comply with the requests of local law enforcement officials.
* Report harassment or crimes to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.

**Demonstrations:**

* Avoid public demonstrations. U.S. citizens who have participated in demonstrations have been arrested by the Russian authorities.

**Crime:** Crimes against tourists do occur at popular tourist sites and on public transportation. U.S. citizens have been victims of serious crimes when visiting Russia. Russian authorities are not always willing to investigate crimes impartially and thoroughly.

* **Be cautious and aware of your surroundings.**
* **Exercise caution in the vicinity of large crowds.**
* **Do not leave bags unattended.**
* **Never leave your drink unattended in a bar or club. Alcohol was a significant factor in most criminal activity reported by foreign visitors.**
* **Report Credit card or ATM card theft to the credit card company or issuing bank immediately.**
* **Avoid carrying large sums of cash.**

**Cybercrime:** Cybercrime is a major issue in Russia. Hackers and organized crime groups collaborate, especially targeting the financial sector. They use malware, spam, spear phishing, and social engineering to infect, steal, or compromise personal information. Therefore, U.S. citizens and companies must be alert and use cyber security measures to lower their risks.

U.S. citizens have no reasonable expectation of privacy in Russia. Telephone and electronic communications are subject to surveillance at any time and without advisory, which may compromise sensitive information. The Russian System for Operational-Investigative Activities (SORM) legally permits authorities to monitor and record all data that traverses Russia’s networks.

See the [Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the [FBI](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/RussianFederation.html#ExternalPopup) pages for additional information on scams.

**Victims of Crime:** U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy in Moscow for assistance. Report crimes to the local police at 02 or 102, or 112 if using a mobile phone, and the U.S. Embassy at +7 495 728-5000.

Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime. U.S. law enforcement agencies generally do not have jurisdiction to investigate crimes against U.S. citizens that occur on Russian territory.
