# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Road conditions and driver safety customs differ significantly from those in the United States. In some more remote areas of Russia, roads are practically nonexistent or have poor or nonexistent shoulders.

Drivers are required by law to yield to pedestrians in crosswalks, and this is generally observed. It is dangerous for pedestrians to cross a street where there is not a crosswalk present.

Do not drive outside the major cities at night.

Construction sites and road hazards are often unmarked.

**Traffic Laws:**  Russian authorities to sometimes consider traffic or parking infractions as "administrative violations." These can lead to deportation and denial of reentry to Russia.

* Drivers must carry third-party liability insurance under a policy valid in Russia.
* You may drive for 60 days using your U.S. driver’s license, with a notarized Russian translation.
* Tourists may also use International Driving Permits issued by the [American Automobile Association](https://www.aaa.com/vacation/idpf.html) or the American Automobile Touring Alliance to drive in Russia.
* Russian law requires foreigners on business or employment visas or with permanent residence status to have a Russian driver’s license.
* Driving regulations are strictly enforced and violators are subject to severe legal penalties.
* Russia practices a zero-tolerance policy for driving under the influence of alcohol. Authorities can detain an intoxicated driver.
* If you are involved in an accident, do not move your vehicle from the accident site. You may be held liable if you move your car even if you are not at fault.
* Roadside police checkpoints are commonplace. Be prepared to stop and show identity documents and proof of registration and insurance.

**Public Transportation:**

Moscow and St. Petersburg have extensive, efficient public transit systems, as do many other urban areas in Russia.

In metropolitan areas, well-marked taxis are generally safe and reliable. Do not use unmarked taxis. Passengers have been the victims of robbery, kidnapping, extortion, and theft.

**AVIATION SAFETY OVERSIGHT:** The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed that the Government of Russia's Civil Aviation Authority is not in compliance with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Russia's air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the [FAA's safety assessment page.](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa)

**Maritime Travel:** Mariners planning travel to Russia should check the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Maritime Administration site for [U.S. maritime advisories and alert](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts#:~:text=There%20are%20no%20active%20alerts%20at%20this%20time.)s. Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard homeport website](https://homeport.uscg.mil/) and the [NGA broadcast warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings) website.

The Commandant of the Coast Guard is unable to determine if effective anti-terrorism measures are in place in Russia’s ports as required by 46 U.S. Code § 70108.
