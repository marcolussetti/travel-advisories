# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

Exercise extreme caution when participating in water sports, such as swimming, boating, and fishing, as the tides and currents around the islands are very strong. Several small fishing boats have been lost at sea, and drownings have occurred on the beaches and along the coast in Santiago, Sal, and on other islands.

The entire island of Fogo is an active volcano. Future eruptions remain a threat, as do earth tremors throughout the islands, especially on Fogo, Brava, and Santo Antão, and beneath the ocean channels that separate them. General information about natural disaster preparedness is available [on our website](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).

**Crime**:  Petty crime and burglary are common in Cabo Verde, especially at marketplaces, festivals, street fairs, and public gatherings. Criminals target anyone perceived to be affluent, regardless of nationality. Avoid groups of children who appear to have no adult supervision, since the perpetrators of petty theft and pickpocketing are often groups of street children. Muggings occur often, particularly at night and in more isolated areas, and often involve violence. The perpetrators are predominantly males between the ages of 14 and 25 operating in groups of two or more. Due to inadequate lighting in many public areas, you should be especially vigilant after dark, carry a flashlight to illuminate your path, and never go out alone. You should also keep vehicle doors and windows locked and avoid isolated places.

It is dangerous to use hillside stairways connecting neighborhoods in Praia and many other Cabo Verdean cities and towns, even in broad daylight. These stairways isolate users and make them vulnerable to assault.

**International Financial Scams**:  See the [Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the [FBI](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/CaboVerde.html#ExternalPopup) pages for information.

**Victims of Crime**:  U.S. citizen victims of crime are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance.

Report crimes to the local police at 132 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(238) 260-8900 or after hours at +(238) 991-3325. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating crime and prosecuting offenders.

**Domestic Violence**:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.

**Tourism**:  The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities are not common. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment may not be readily available. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities to provide urgent medical treatment. There is no hyperbaric/decompression chamber in the country for scuba divers. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).
