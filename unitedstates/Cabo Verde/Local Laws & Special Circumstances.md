# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Cabo Verde are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.

The Department of State warns all U.S. citizens against taking any firearms or ammunition into Cabo Verde. If you are caught entering Cabo Verde with firearms or ammunitions, you may face severe penalties, including prison time.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and [the Department of Justice](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/CaboVerde.html#ExternalPopup) website.

**Arrest Notification:**If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [website](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Counterfeit and pirated goods are illegal in both Cabo Verde and the United States.  U.S. citizens who buy these goods are punishable under Cabo Verdean law. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/CaboVerde.html#ExternalPopup) for more information.
