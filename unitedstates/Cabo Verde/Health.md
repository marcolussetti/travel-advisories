For emergency services in Cabo Verde, dial **132**.

Medical facilities in Cabo Verde are limited, and some medications are in short supply or otherwise unavailable. The country’s largest hospitals are in Praia and Mindelo. There are smaller public health centers and private medical clinics, of variable quality in both personnel and equipment, throughout the country. Transportation between islands is difficult, and inter-island medevac options are limited. The islands of Brava and Santo Antão do not have operational airports, which makes air evacuation in the event of a medical emergency difficult.

Those traveling to Cabo Verde for scuba diving should be aware that there is no hyperbaric/decompression facility on the islands.

Ambulance services are:

* not widely available, and training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.
* not present throughout the country or are unreliable in most areas.
* not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment.
* not staffed with trained paramedics and often have little or no medical equipment.
* Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

**We do not pay medical bills.**  Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance coverage overseas. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/CaboVerde.html#ExternalPopup) for more information on types of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/CaboVerde.html#ExternalPopup) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
