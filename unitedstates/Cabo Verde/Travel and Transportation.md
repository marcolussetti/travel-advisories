# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:**Cabo Verde has an extensive road system. On the islands of Santiago, Sal, and São Vicente, many urban and rural roads are asphalt. On other islands, some roads are narrow, winding, and mostly cobblestone.

During the rainy season, cobblestone roads are especially slippery, and mud and rockslides are common on roads that cut through mountains. Roads and streets often are unlit and driving at night is hazardous.

**Traffic Laws**:Most accidents result from aggressive driving, speeding, passing on blind curves, and/or on inclines or declines in the rain.

Driving while under the influence of alcohol is a serious problem in Cabo Verde and U.S. citizens could face severe penalties, including prison time, for driving under the influence. You are most likely to encounter a drunk driver on Sundays and at night. Exercise extreme caution toward both pedestrians and other drivers after celebrations, festivals, and open-air concerts as well as during holiday periods, such as Christmas, New Year’s Eve, and Carnival.

**Public Transportation**:Praia has three principal modes of public transport: taxi, bus, and commuter vans. Using buses and vans is strongly discouraged. These vans may have a fixed, but flexible route and often contain more passengers than is safe. Licensed, registered taxis are clearly marked and tan/cream in color. While official taxis are considered safe and reliable, passengers should still exercise good common sense and avoid sharing a taxi with strangers.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of Cabo Verde’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Cabo Verde’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa).
