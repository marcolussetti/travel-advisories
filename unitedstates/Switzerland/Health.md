For emergency services in Switzerland dial 144, or 117 for the police.

**Medical care** is comparable to that found in the United States. Ambulance services are widely available.

**The U.S. government does not pay medical bills**

Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas. Swiss medical facilities and care providers will ask for you to settle your bills onsite and you will have to claim a refund with your insurer later. It is common for hospitals to ask for a deposit to ensure medical costs will be covered.

**Medical Insurance**

Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

**Mental Health Resources**

Under local law assisted suicide is legal in Switzerland, and several known organizations facilitate assisted suicide to consenting adults. If you or someone you know is experiencing a mental health crisis, help is available and is free and anonymous. For those in the United States, please contact the [National Suicide Prevention Hotline](https://988lifeline.org/) by dialing 988 from a phone in the United States.  For those in Switzerland, please contact [Die Dargebotene Hand](https://www.143.ch/) (The Helping Hand), a service aimed at adults, by dialing 143 from a phone in Switzerland (assistance is available in English, German, French, and Italian); or [Pro Joventute](https://147.ch/) (For the Children), a service aimed at youth, by dialing 147 from a phone in Switzerland (assistance available in German, French, and Italian).

**Medications**

Over-the-counter medicine is available at pharmacies and a pharmacist is on call 24/7. Information regarding the pharmacy and pharmacist on duty in your area can be obtained over the medical emergency telephone line by dialing 144. If traveling with prescription medication, check with the [Swiss Federal Customs Administration](https://www.ezv.admin.ch/ezv/en/home/information-individuals/bans--restrictions-and-authorisations/medicines--medicinal-products--and-doping.html) to ensure the medication is legal in Switzerland. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription.

**Vaccinations**

Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations recommended](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/index.html) by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

* **Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE)** is common. Travelers planning high-risk activities (camping, adventure travel) should take precautions. See the website of the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/diseases/tickborne-encephalitis) for more details on TBE and TBE prevention.

**Air Quality**

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.

* Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in Switzerland.
* For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/).
* For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).
