* Review the [Country Security Report](https://www.osac.gov/Country/Switzerland/Content/Detail/Report/762a8fac-6467-4db1-a087-1cc8fe43592c) for Switzerland.
* Prepare a plan for emergency situations. Review the [International Traveler’s Checklist](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-checklist.html).
