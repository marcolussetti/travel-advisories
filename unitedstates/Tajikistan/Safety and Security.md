# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Potential for Terrorist Activity:** Terrorist organizations, including ISIS, have a presence in the region. Their activities mostly include recruiting sympathizers and followers through online platforms and social media, with the aim of conducting terrorist attacks in Tajikistan and other countries. While attacks are rare in Tajikistan, terrorists have planned and carried out attacks against foreigners and government entities, such as law enforcement and security services.

Tajik authorities maintain a high level of security to thwart terrorist attacks. This could lead terrorists to seek softer targets including facilities where U.S. citizens and other foreigners congregate such as residential areas; clubs and restaurants; markets; places of worship; schools; hotels; outdoor recreational events, including popular hiking areas; and resorts. U.S. citizens should avoid predictable patterns of movement and revealing their personal information and location on social media. If using social media, ensure your privacy settings are appropriately set.

U.S. Embassy Dushanbe employs heightened security precautions. U.S. citizens should report any unusual activity to local authorities and then inform the Embassy.

**Border Areas with Afghanistan:** Reconsider travel near and along Tajikistan’s border with Afghanistan due to terrorism. The current political situation in Afghanistan creates a challenging and unpredictable environment in the border areas due to evolving security conditions. Additionally, the land border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan has been closed since the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in 2021. Travel in the mountainous region along the Afghan border can be dangerous due to the proximity of militant groups across the border. Militant groups have attempted cross-border rocket attacks and armed incursions into Tajikistan. Be vigilant when camping, biking, or sheltering in the open after dark. U.S. citizens should remain alert and avoid activities that develop predictable patterns of movement. If documenting travel on social media, please ensure your privacy settings are appropriately set.

**Restricted Zone of Gorno-Badakhshan:** Reconsider travel to Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast (GBAO). The current political situation in Afghanistan creates a challenging and unpredictable environment in the border areas due to evolving security conditions. Do not enter the Gorno-Badakhshan (GBAO) region without official permission. Persons violating the law may be detained by Tajik law enforcement. Violent clashes with security forces erupted in GBAO in recent years, and the government of Tajikistan can suspend travel permits for non-Tajik citizens on short notice. To enter this restricted zone, request a special permit from Tajik embassies/consulates or from the MFA’s Main Consular Department or the Department of Visas and Registration of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (OVIR) if applying within Tajikistan. Submit authorization requests at least two weeks in advance of your trip. If granted, authorities will annotate your passport with the names of the settlements and cities you are authorized to visit.

If applying for an e-Visa for tourism, you can apply for official permission to visit GBAO at the same time, for an additional fee. Please visit the [Republic of Tajikistan’s e-visa application webpage](https://www.evisa.tj/index.evisa.html) for information on electronic visas to Tajikistan and instructions for a GBAO permit.

**Border Areas with Kyrgyzstan:** Exercise caution in areas near and along Tajikistan’s border with Kyrgyzstan.Several instances of clashes between Tajik and Kyrgyz citizens, as well as armed skirmishes involving border guards, have occurred, particularly in the Isfara and Vorukh districts.

**Unexploded Landmines** and cluster munitions are a hazard along the Afghan-Tajik and Uzbek-Tajik borders, as well as in the Vakhsh and Rasht valleys. Heed land mine warning signs. Do not venture off the road into areas marked off with red and white plastic tape. Avoid roadside ditches, shoulders, and unmarked trails. Never touch anything resembling unexploded munitions.

**Crime:** Criminal activity in Dushanbe is moderate. Incidents are not usually violent, but muggings, armed robberies, and pick-pocketing do occur. Police do not provide adequate or immediate assistance and often will not open minor or routine cases.

Other criminal activity, such as narcotics trafficking, can result in violence.

Travel in pairs, especially at night. Sexual harassment of unaccompanied women is very common. Carry a copy of your passport (separate from your wallet) with you at all times.

See the [Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the[FBI webpages](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/scams-and-safety/common-frauds-and-scams)for information on scams.

**Victims of Crime:** U.S. citizen victims of crime, including sexual assault and domestic violence, may wish to contact the police or head to the nearest hospital to seek medical attention and report the crime. Please also contact the U.S. Embassy at (992)-37-229-2000.

The local equivalent to the 911 emergency line in Tajikistan is 101 for fire, 102 for police, and 103 for ambulance service (from cell phones), and in Dushanbe, dial 235-4545 for the State Traffic Inspectorate (GAI) police for traffic accidents.

Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes.

**Tourism:** No formal tourism industry infrastructure is in place in most locations. Tourists are considered to be participating in activities at their own risk. Emergency response and subsequent appropriate medical treatment is for the most part not available in-country. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase traveler’s insurance for on-the-ground medical coverage as well as [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).

**Demonstrations and Protests:** Both are rare in Tajikistan; however, due to security reasons, U.S. citizens are advised not to participate.
