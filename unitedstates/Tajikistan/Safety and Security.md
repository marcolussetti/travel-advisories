# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:** Terrorist groups and individuals inspired by them want to attack U.S. citizens outside of the United States. They are using simpler methods of attack like knives, guns, and vehicles to target crowds. They often go after unprotected or vulnerable targets.

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

Terrorist organizations, including ISIS, have a presence in the region. Their activities mostly include recruiting supporters online and through social media, with the aim of conducting terrorist attacks in Tajikistan and other countries. While attacks are rare in Tajikistan, terrorists have planned and carried out attacks against foreigners and government entities, such as law enforcement and security services. Tajik authorities maintain a high level of security to prevent terrorist attacks.

**Border Areas with Afghanistan:**Reconsider travel **near and along Tajikistan’s border with Afghanistan** due to terrorism. The current political situation in Afghanistan creates a challenging and unpredictable environment in the border areas due to evolving security conditions. The land border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan was closed after the Taliban takeover in 2021.  Currently, only “Panji Poyon” border crossing is open for land travel between the countries. Travel in the mountainous region along the Afghan border can be dangerous due to the proximity of militant groups across the border.

The [Department of State Travel Advisory for Afghanistan](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/afghanistan-advisory.html) is currently at **Level 4:  Do Not Travel.**  Please read the Travel Advisory if you are considering traveling near the Tajik-Afghan border.

* Militant groups have attempted cross-border rocket attacks and armed incursions into Tajikistan.
* Be vigilant when camping, biking, or sheltering in the open after dark.
* Stay alert and avoid activities with predictable patterns of movement.
* If using social media, set your privacy settings to hide your exact location.

**Restricted Zone of Gorno-Badakhshan:** Reconsider travel to Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast (GBAO).

* Do not enter the Gorno-Badakhshan (GBAO) region without official permission.
* If you enter without permission, Tajik law enforcement may detain you.
* Violent clashes with security forces have occurred in GBAO in recent years.
* Tajikistan may suspend travel permits for non-Tajik citizens on short notice.
* To enter this restricted zone, request a special permit from a Tajik embassy or consulate, or from the MFA’s Main Consular Department or OVIR, if applying within Tajikistan. Submit your request at least 2 weeks before your trip. If granted, authorities will list in your passport the names of authorized cities and other destinations.

If applying for an e-Visa for tourism, you can apply for official permission to visit GBAO at the same time, for an additional fee. Please visit [Tajikistan’s e-Visa website](https://www.evisa.tj/index.evisa.html) for more information.

**Border Areas with the Kyrgyz Republic:** Stay alert when traveling **near, along, or through the Tajikistan-Kyrgyz Republic land border.** There have been armed conflicts between Tajik and Kyrgyz border guards, as well as between civilians and residents, over the past 5 years—particularly in the Isfara area and the Vorukh enclave. Bilateral agreements between the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan have led to more travel at the Guliston–Kyzyl-Bel and Madaniyat–Kayragach border crossings.

**Landmines** and unexploded cluster munitions are a hazard along the Afghan-Tajik and Uzbek-Tajik borders, as well as in the Vakhsh and Rasht valleys.
