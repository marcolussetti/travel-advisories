# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Travel is difficult and unreliable in Tajikistan. Police and military checkpoints can make road travel outside Dushanbe more difficult.

* If you are involved in an accident:
  + In Dushanbe, call the City Traffic Inspectorate at 235-6623,
  + Outside Dushanbe, call the State Traffic Inspectorate (GAI in Russian or BDA in Tajiki) at 235-4545.
* The most common road dangers are related to poor road infrastructure and natural events like rockslides and avalanches, particularly in winter.
* Exercise caution on rural or mountainous roads, especially in underpopulated areas.
* Travel by car only during the day and on routes you know.
* Travel in the mountainous region along the Afghan border can be dangerous, even during daylight hours.
* Car accidents and erratic driving are common. Pedestrians tend to jaywalk or walk along highways without paying attention to traffic.
* Public transportation in the city is often overcrowded and not always safe. Bus service between major cities is unreliable.
* The GAI maintains checkpoints in cities and along highways. They frequently stop vehicles for inspection and to check drivers’ documents. The government will not register vehicles with dark, tinted windows.
* Traffic police may stop cars and solicit bribes. In Dushanbe, luxury cars and those with government license plates may ignore police, traffic lights, and other traffic rules. Police stop other cars frequently for document checks.
* Drivers with non-Tajik government-issued plates may have problems crossing the Tajik-Uzbek border. Police in Dushanbe may stop these cars and drivers more often.
* Neighboring countries sometimes unilaterally close borders, many border crossing points are not open to foreigners, and some borders are poorly delineated and even mined.

**Winter Road Travel:** Exercise caution and limit winter travel to Tajikistan’s mountain regions.

* Avalanches are common.
* Don’t travel over closed mountain passes.
* Roads are often not well maintained.
* For Dushanbe-Chanak (Dushanbe-Khujand) road conditions, please contact [Innovative Road Solutions](https://irs.tj/).

**Landmines** and unexploded cluster munitions are a hazard along the Afghan-Tajik and Uzbek-Tajik borders, as well as in the Vakhsh and Rasht valleys.

* Follow all posted landmine warnings.
* Do not leave roadways in any areas marked with red and white plastic tape.
* Avoid roadside ditches, shoulders, and unmarked trails.
* Never touch anything resembling unexploded munitions.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed Tajikistan’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with international standards for aviation safety oversight. FAA’s [website](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa) includes more information on its assessment program.
