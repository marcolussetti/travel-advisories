**Reissued after periodic review with minor updates and information about dual nationality.**

Exercise increased caution in Tajikistan due to **terrorism, unexploded landmines, occasional violence near the border with Kyrgyzstan, and limited ability to assist U.S.-Tajik dual nationals**. Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.

Reconsider travel to**:**

* Tajikistan’s border with Afghanistan
* Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast

**Country Summary:** Terrorist organizations are known to have a presence in the region and have targeted foreigners and local authorities in the past.

**Terrorist attacks** can happen with little or no warning, with terrorists targeting public areas such as tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, restaurants, places of worship, school campuses, and government facilities.

**Unexploded landmines** and cluster munitions are a hazard along the Afghan-Tajik and Uzbek-Tajik borders, as well as in the Vakhsh and Rasht valleys. Heed land mine warning signs. Do not venture off the road into areas marked with red and white plastic tape. Avoid roadside ditches, shoulders, and unmarked trails in these regions. Never touch anything resembling unexploded munitions.

Be cautious when traveling **near and along the Tajikistan-Kyrgyzstan border**. There have been several instances of armed skirmishes between Tajik and Kyrgyz border guards over the past five years, particularly in the Isfara area and the Vorukh enclave.

Tajikistan does not recognize dual nationality with the United States. Dual U.S.-Tajik citizens and U.S. citizens of Tajik descent may be subject to additional scrutiny and harassment from local authorities and may be denied access to U.S. consular officials while in detention.

* Keep a low profile.
* Be aware of your surroundings.
* Monitor local media for breaking events and be prepared to adjust your plans.
* Do not touch unknown metal objects and avoid traveling off well-used roads, tracks, and paths due to risk of unexploded ordnance.
* If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately.

**Border Areas with Afghanistan – Level 3: Reconsider Travel**

Reconsider travel in proximity of Tajikistan's border with Afghanistan due to terrorism. The current political situation in Afghanistan creates a challenging and unpredictable environment in the border areas due to evolving security conditions. Travel in the mountainous region along the Afghan border can be dangerous due to the proximity of militant groups across the border. U.S. citizens should remain alert and avoid activities that develop predictable patterns of movement. If documenting travel on social media, please ensure your privacy settings are appropriately set.

**Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast (GBAO)– Level 3: Reconsider Travel**

The challenging and unpredictable environment in northern Afghanistan has the potential to spill over insecurity into neighboring Tajikistan’s GBAO region. GBAO is a restricted region for non-Tajik citizens, requiring a travel permits from Tajik authorities. Violent clashes with security forces erupted in GBAO in recent years, and the government of Tajikistan can suspend travel permits for non-Tajik citizens on short notice.
