**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you break local laws, even if you don't know it, you can be kicked out of the area, arrested, or put in prison. If you want to start a business or work in a job that needs special permits or licenses, you should get information from the local authorities before you start.

* Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking illegal drugs are severe. Expect long jail sentences and heavy fines if you are convicted.
* Tajikistan maintains zero tolerance for alcohol-related incidents.
* It is illegal to take pictures of certain buildings. Ask before taking photographs of possible military or security areas.
* Always carry a copy of your U.S. passport, Tajik visa, and visa registration:
  + Police often check documents.
  + Check your visa and registration validity dates regularly,
  + Make sure you renew travel documents before they expire.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law.
