# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities prior to practicing or operating a business.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116)website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

* Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs are severe. Expect long jail sentences and heavy fines if you are convicted.
* Tajikistan maintains zero tolerance for alcohol-related incidents.
* It is illegal to take pictures of certain buildings. Ask before taking photographs of anything of possible military or security interest.
* Always carry a copy of your U.S. passport, Tajik visa, and visa registration, since local police frequently conduct document inspections. Check your visa and registration validity dates regularly and renew them before they expire.

**Currency and Banking:** Tajikistan is a cash-only economy. Credit cards are rarely accepted, and traveler’s checks are not used.

International banking services are limited. Some ATM machines are available and dispense local currency. Tajikistan’s national currency is the Somoni, which is convertible to USD.

**Earthquakes:** Tajikistan is an earthquake-prone country. Visitors to Tajikistan should evaluate their own emergency preparedness and plan accordingly. For information on natural disaster preparedness, see [U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).](https://www.fema.gov/)

**Faith-Based Travelers:** Tajik authorities maintain strict rules for religious expression and worship. There have been cases of harassment by security officials of individuals with beards, particularly when exiting mosques or other places of worship.

**LGB Travelers:** There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events, although Tajik society is generally hostile to LGB interests.
