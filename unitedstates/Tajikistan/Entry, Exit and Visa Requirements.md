# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

Requirements for entry:

* Passport valid for at least six months with at least two blank pages for entry and exit stamps.
* Visa if you plan to stay longer than 30 days or are traveling for a non-tourist purpose.
* Visa support letter if you are traveling on a non-tourist visa.

**Visa-free entry:** U.S. citizens are eligible for visa-free entry into Tajikistan for stays lasting no more than 30 days (non-extendable), regardless of the purpose of travel. For stays of 10 days or longer, registration within 10 days of arrival at the nearest Department of Visas and Registration of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (OVIR) *is* *required*. Registration costs 180 Tajik Somoni and takes up to three business days. Failure to register or loss of the registration form can result in fines and delay your departure. Tourists should seek registration assistance from their hotel or tour operator.

In emergency situations (i.e. medical), the Main Consular Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) can provide an emergency exit visa for a period not exceeding seven days upon submission of a formal request letter, medical documentation, and a copy of the original itinerary.

Travelers planning to spend more than 30 days in Tajikistan should obtain a tourist e-Visa[online](https://www.evisa.tj/index.evisa.html)or a T-visa upon arrival at airport.

**Tourist e-Visas:** Tajikistan offers two types of e-Visas: single entry and multiple entry. Visas are issued for a period of 90 days and are valid for stays up to 60 days. The e-Visa is non-extendable and you can [apply for it](https://www.evisa.tj/index.evisa.html)only if you are outside of Tajikistan. Registration with the Department of Visas and Registration of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (OVIR) is not required when admitted using an e-Visa.

Refer to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA)’s Main Consular Department’s [website](https://consular.tj/visa.aspx) for further visa information.

**Non-tourist visas:** Applications for non-tourist purposes of travel, including to visit family or friends (XC1-visa), to conduct business (K-visa), or to attend an educational facility (O-visa), can be submitted online to the MFA’s Main Consular Department. Supporting documents, including a Tajik visa support letter, are required. Visa validities and fees vary depending on purpose of travel. A personal appearance at a Tajik embassy or consulate may be required depending on the visa category.

Tajik visa support letters are required for all non-tourist visas. To obtain a visa support letter, the inviting organization submits a request to the MFA’s Main Consular Department. When invited by a private Tajik resident (e.g., a friend or relative), the inviting party requests a notification letter from the Department of Visas and Registration of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (OVIR). Any required supporting documents and the visa support letter should be submitted to the MFA’s Main Consular Department in Tajikistan by the inviting party.

Some non-tourist visa categories allow for the visa to be issued upon arrival, eliminating the need to appear in-person at a Tajik embassy or consulate. This upon-arrival request must be selected at the time the application is submitted online and an additional fee will be required.

Tajik visa registration stamps are required for non-tourist stays more than two days. Most travelers must register within three days of entering the country at the nearest Department of Visas and Registration of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (OVIR). Journalists, official travelers, and employees of international organizations must register with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Failure to register can result in fines and delay your departure.

**Border Zones**: Tajik authorities have implemented restrictions on travel to areas near Tajikistan’s border with other countries. The Embassy recommends that U.S. citizens provide an itinerary for intended travel to any border zone to the Department of Visas and Registration of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (OVIR) to obtain prior permission and information about any restrictions.

**Exiting Tajikistan:** Be sure to leave Tajikistan before your visa or visa-free admission expires or you may be required to pay a fine as well as pay for an exit visa.

**Departure options from Tajikistan are limited.** To maximize departure options, obtain extended visas for travel to countries with reliable connections to Tajikistan, including Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and China.

**Transit Visas to Russia:** The [Department of State Travel Advisory for Russia](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/russia-travel-advisory.html) is currently at Level 4: Do Not Travel. Please read the Travel Advisory if you are considering transiting through Russia. If you do travel from Tajikistan through Russia to a third country – including plane changes – you must have a transit visa for Russia. You cannot get a Russian visa at the airport. If you arrive in Russia without the appropriate visa, authorities may restrict you from future travel to Russia. Refer to information on [Travel.State.Gov for visa requirements for Russia](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/RussianFederation.html).

**Dual Nationality:** Tajikistan does not recognize dual nationality with the United States. If you are a dual national of the United States and Tajikistan, or otherwise have ethnic or historical ties to Tajikistan, it is possible that Tajik authorities will assert that you are a Tajik citizen, and if you are detained, may deny you access to U.S. consular officials.

If you are a naturalized U.S. citizen or have a possible claim to Tajik nationality, and you are traveling to Tajikistan, inform yourself about Tajik nationality law and practices relating to determination and loss of Tajik citizenship. Under Tajik law, naturalization as a U.S. citizen does not automatically cancel your Tajik nationality. If you have questions about your Tajik nationality, please contact the [**Embassy of the Republic of Tajikistan**](https://mfa.tj/en/washington) in the United States of America.

U.S. citizens, including U.S. citizen minor children, who are planning to remain in Tajikistan for an extended period of time, are required to have a valid Tajik visa. Please note fines for not maintaining a valid visa accumulate quickly and can be very expensive. U.S. citizens are required to pay any outstanding fines before exiting the country.

**HIV/AIDS Information:** Some HIV/AIDS entry restrictions exist for visitors and foreign residents of Tajikistan. If you are applying to be in Tajikistan for more than 90 days, you must present a medical certificate with your application confirming that you are HIV-free. Due to frequent policy changes, verify this information with the [Embassy of Tajikistan](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Tajikistan.html#ExternalPopup) before traveling.
