**Medical care is limited and significantly below U.S. standards, with severe shortages of basic medical supplies, including disposable needles, anesthetics, prescriptions drugs, and antibiotics.**

For emergency services in Tajikistan, dial 03 (103 from cell phone).

Ambulance services are:

* Not present throughout the country or are unreliable in most areas except in Dushanbe.
* Not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment.
* Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

There have been outbreaks of the following diseases:

* Water-borne diseases (such as Giardia)
* Hemorrhagic Fever
* Hepatitis A, B & C (frequently transmitted through medical and dental procedures)
* Malaria – in the southern region at Afghan border
* Tuberculosis (including multidrug-resistant (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR-TB) varieties)
* Typhoid – in Dushanbe and the southern provinces of Khatlon
* Rabies
* Chicken Pox
* Measles

Drink bottled or thoroughly boiled water while in Tajikistan. Avoid contact with street dogs in urban areas.

**Pollution levels in Tajikistan are reported online at**[AirNow.gov.](https://www.airnow.gov/)  Exercise caution and adjust your outdoor activities on days when pollution levels are elevated.

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas. Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in [destination]. For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/). For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).

**We do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas.

**Medical Insurance:**  Make sure your health insurance plan provides medical coverage in Tajikistan. Care providers in Tajikistan are not able to accept credit cards; therefore, providers only accept cash payments. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation due to inability of local medical providers to address many urgent-care situations.

**Prescriptions:** If traveling with prescription medication, check with the [**Embassy of the Republic of Tajikistan**](https://mfa.tj/en/washington) in the United States of America to ensure that the medication is legal in Tajikistan. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.

**Vaccinations:**Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/tajikistan)recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
