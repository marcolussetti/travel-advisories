# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Paraguay are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. Additionally, it is not uncommon for individuals detained on drug-related charges to spend extended periods in detention before trial.  
  
Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Paraguay.html#ExternalPopup) website.  
 **Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.  
  
**Faith-Based Travelers:** See the [Department of State’s International Religious Freedom Report](https://www.state.gov/reports/2017-report-on-international-religious-freedom/).

**LGB Travelers:** There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Paraguay. See our [LGB Travel Information](/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgb.html) page and section 6 of our [Human Rights Report](https://www.state.gov/reports/2018-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details.  
  
Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance: Paraguayan law prohibits discrimination against persons with physical and mental disabilities in employment, education, access to health care, and the provision of state services, and the government seeks to enforce these prohibitions. Nonetheless, access to buildings, pedestrian paths, and transportation is extremely difficult for persons with disabilities, as mandated accessibility requirements are rarely enforced.
