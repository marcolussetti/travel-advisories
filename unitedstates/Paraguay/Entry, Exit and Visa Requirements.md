# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

U.S. citizens need a valid passport to enter Paraguay. U.S. citizens with expired or damaged passports may not be allowed to enter and could be sent back to the United States at their own expense. Private U.S. citizens do not need a visa for stays of up to 90 days for tourism or business. Some minor children need a special notarized authorization from Paraguayan authorities to enter and exit the country when not accompanied by both legal parents/guardians. Please visit the Embassy’s [website](https://py.usembassy.gov/) for more specifics about whether this applies to your situation.

To leave Paraguay by air, you must pay an airport departure tax. Some airlines include the Paraguayan airport departure tax in the cost of the airline ticket. It is recommended that you check with the airline in order to determine whether or not the departure tax has been included.

Visit the [Embassy of Paraguay](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Paraguay.html#ExternalPopup) website for the most current visa information.
