# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Security Messages:** Messages regarding demonstrations, strikes, and weather-related events are posted on the Embassy’s [website](https://py.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/security-and-travel-information/).

**Terrorism:** The U.S. Embassy is not aware of any specific threat to U.S. citizens in Paraguay. Nevertheless, you should remain vigilant at all times while travelling.

**Crime:**Transnational criminal organizations facilitate the illicit trafficking of arms, narcotics, and other goods in Paraguay, particularly along Paraguay’s eastern border with Brazil, most prominently from Pedro Juan Caballero south to Ciudad del Este, including the Tri-Border Area of Paraguay, Brazil, and Argentina. Coupled with the lack of sufficient police enforcement, the involvement of these organizations heightens violent crime in these areas. The U.S. Embassy in Asuncion requires U.S. government personnel and their family members to provide advance notice and a travel itinerary when traveling outside of the capital, particularly when traveling to Ciudad del Este, or to the departments of Alto Parana, San Pedro, Concepcion, Amambay, and Canindeyu.

U.S. citizens visiting or residing in Paraguay should also avoid large gatherings or events where crowds have congregated to demonstrate, protest, or cause damage as a byproduct of celebrating an event, such as after soccer matches.

Street crime is prevalent in the cities and the number of pickpockets and armed assaults is increasing. Robbers are more regularly using motorcycles to approach victims with a weapon and demand a wallet or purse, before quickly fleeing.

Thieves have been known to pose as service people (e.g., mailmen, reporters, water meter readers, electrical repairmen, delivery persons, maintenance personnel) to gain access to homes. They sometimes wear uniforms and travel in vans and automobiles with markings that make the vehicle appear official. Do not let such people inside your home unless you have contacted the service provider directly to verify the appointment.

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).
