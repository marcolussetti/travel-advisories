**Crime:** Robberies, burglaries, assault, and auto theft can occur in Australia’s larger cities.

Foreign visitors in popular tourist areas are targets for pickpockets, purse-snatchers, and petty thieves. Most petty crime can be avoided with basic security precautions.

Stay alert when visiting bars or clubs in the entertainment areas of major cities. “Bar brawls” and other assaults sometimes occur. Watch out for drink spiking when drinking alcohol with unfamiliar people.

Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues. They may also occur on politically significant holidays and during international events.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Some past demonstrations have turned violent.
* Check local media for updates on traffic advisories.
