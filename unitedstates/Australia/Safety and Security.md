# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:** Terrorists have targeted, and could continue to target, Australia.

* Australia has an alert system for possible terrorist attacks. The threat levels range from “not expected” to “certain.” The [Australian National Security website](https://www.nationalsecurity.gov.au/) has up-to-date information regarding the current terrorism threat level. You may also contact the Australian National Security Hotline at 61-1-800-123-400.
* U.S. citizens in Australia should remain vigilant toward their personal security and exercise caution.
* Australian law protects the right of individuals and groups to engage in peaceful protest and to publicly express their views. Demonstrations and political rallies are generally approved by local authorities and well publicized. However, please be cautious of any possible confrontation that could escalate into violence. You should attempt to avoid the areas of demonstrations and be careful within the vicinity of any demonstrations. You should stay current with media coverage of local events and always be aware of your surroundings.

**Crime:**

* You should be aware that robberies, burglaries, assault, and auto theft are common in Australia’s larger cities.
* Foreign visitors in popular tourist areas are targets for pickpockets, purse-snatchers, and petty thieves. Most petty crime can be avoided if basic security precautions are taken.
* Be careful when visiting bars or clubs in the entertainment areas of major cities, as “bar brawls” and other assaults sometimes occur. You should watch out for drink spiking when consuming alcohol with unfamiliar people.
