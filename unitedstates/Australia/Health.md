**The Department of State, U.S. embassies and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [Insurance Overseas page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance providers with overseas coverage. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Travel Insurance page](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

* We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the [Australian Border Force](https://www.abf.gov.au/entering-and-leaving-australia/can-you-bring-it-in/categories/medicines-and-substances) to ensure the medication is legal in Australia.

**Vaccinations:** Be up to date on all [vaccinations](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Air Quality**: Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas. Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in [destination]. For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/). For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/). For general health information, visit the “[Your Health Abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad.html)” page.

Air pollution is a significant problem during certain months in Australia due to bushfires. Consider the impact pollution from seasonal bushfires may have on your health. Consult your doctor before traveling.

The air quality varies considerably and changes with the season. It is typically at its worst in the bushfire season, which varies regionally. Visit the [Bureau of Meteorology](http://www.bom.gov.au/weather-services/fire-weather-centre/fire-weather-season/) for information about regional bushfire seasons. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include:

* Infants, children, teens, and older adults
* People with heart disease and lung disease such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic bronchitis, or emphysema
* People who work or are active outdoors,

The U.S. Embassy maintains a list of hospitals and a link to the Australian National Health Services Directory at [Medical Assistance - U.S. Embassy & Consulates in Australia (usembassy.gov).](https://au.usembassy.gov/medical-assistance/#practitioners) We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.

**Health Facilities in General:**

* Excellent medical care is available in Australia.
* Doctors and hospitals often require payment “up front” prior to service or admission.
* Serious medical problems requiring hospitalization and/or medical evacuation to the United States can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.

**Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery:** Medical tourism is a fast-growing industry. If you want healthcare in another country, you need to know that their medical systems are different from the United States. They may not follow the same rules. Before you travel for medical reasons, talk to your doctor.

Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Medical Tourism website](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/medical-tourism) for information on Medical Tourism. Find out about the risks of medical tourism and what you can do to prepare before traveling to Australia.

**Pharmaceuticals:** U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration have rules for bringing medication back to the United States. Medication bought abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back. The medication must be for personal use and approved for use in the United States.
