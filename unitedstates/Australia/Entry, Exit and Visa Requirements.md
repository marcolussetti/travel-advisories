# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

To enter Australia:

* You must have a valid U.S. passport and
* A visa or approved Electronic Travel Authority (ETA).

If you are traveling to Australia for tourism or business for less than 90 days, you can enter with an [ETA](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/electronic-travel-authority-601). The ETA is an electronic label-free visa and can be obtained using the Australian ETA app for a small fee. Airlines and many travel agents in the United States are also able to apply for ETAs for you.

If you overstay your ETA or any other visa, even for short periods, you may be subject to exclusion, detention, and removal by the [Australian Department of Home Affairs.](https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/)

**SmartGate:** Most U.S passports issued since 2021 have an electronic chip. If you are 16 or older, you can use your passport with SmartGate—Australia’s automated border processing system—upon arrival at participating airports. There is no additional enrollment process or fee to use SmartGate. Visit the [SmartGate](https://www.abf.gov.au/entering-and-leaving-australia/smartgates/arrivals#:~:text=You%20can%20use%20SmartGates%20if,with%20at%20least%20two%20adults) website for more information and for a list of participating airports in Australia.

**Public health restrictions:** Depending on the type of visa you apply for, the length of your stay, and your intended activities in Australia, you may be required to undergo a medical examination before the Australian Department of Home Affairs will issue you a visa.
