**Road Conditions and Safety:**

* Traffic operates on the left side of the road, and all vehicles are right-hand drive.
* Use caution when crossing streets and when driving.
* When crossing roads on foot, make sure you look carefully in all directions.
* Seatbelt are required for drivers and all passengers. You can be fined for not wearing a seatbelt.
* Motorcyclists must wear helmets.
* Speed limits and laws are strictly enforced. Speed limits vary throughout Australia and are measured in kilometers, not miles. Be aware that speed cameras are everywhere, and you will be ticketed for driving over the speed limit.
* Roads and streets are frequently narrower and less graded than U.S. highways.
* Outside major cities, most highways are two-lane roads with long distances between destinations.
* When driving in Australia, use caution while passing or merging with adjacent traffic.
* Use caution when relying on car or phone navigation apps in rural areas. These apps may not always be accurate or account for seasonal road conditions.
* If driving in rural areas, stay alert for free-roaming animals, like kangaroos, and "road-trains,” several semi-truck trailers connected together.
* Passing road-trains is dangerous, and you should pull over to allow on-coming road-trains to pass to avoid being sideswiped.
* If you have no experience with a 4-wheel drive vehicle, you should exercise common-sense when driving in the Australian outback.

**Traffic Laws:**

* Each state/territory has different rules about using a foreign driver’s license and the conditions under which a visitor might have to get an international driver’s license. More information about [driving rules and regulations is available by state.](https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/)
* Texting or holding your phone while driving is illegal in Australia. You can use a hands-free system to communicate while driving.
