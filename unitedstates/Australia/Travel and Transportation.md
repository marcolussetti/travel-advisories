[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:**

* Traffic operates on the left side of the road, and all vehicles use right-hand drive.
* Use caution when crossing streets and when driving.
* When crossing roads on foot, make sure you look carefully in all directions.
* Seat belt use by drivers and all passengers is mandatory, and fines apply for not wearing them.
* Motorcyclists must wear helmets.
* Speed limits and laws are rigorously enforced. Speed limits vary throughout Australia and are measured in kilometers, not miles. Be aware that speed cameras are everywhere and you will be ticketed for driving over the speed limit.
* Roads and streets are frequently narrower and less graded than U.S. highways.
* Outside major metropolitan areas, most highways are two-lane roads with significant distances between destinations.
* When driving in Australia, exercise caution while passing or merging with adjacent traffic.
* If driving in rural areas, be alert to free-roaming animals, such as kangaroos, and "road-trains" (several semi-truck trailers connected together).
* Passing road-trains is dangerous, and you should pull over to allow on-coming road-trains to pass to avoid being sideswiped.
* If you have no experience with a 4-wheel drive vehicle, you should exercise common-sense when driving in the Australian outback.

**Traffic Laws:**

* Each state/territory has different rules about using a foreign driver’s license and the conditions under which a visitor might have to get an international driver’s license. More information about [driving rules and regulations is available by state](https://www.australia.gov.au/information-and-services/transport-and-regional).
* Texting or holding your phone while driving is against the law in Australia, but you can use a hands-free system to communicate while driving.
* For specific information concerning Australian driving permits, vehicle inspection, road tax, mandatory insurance, and the rental and operation of motor vehicles in Australia, visit the [Australian Tourist Commission website.](https://www.australia.com/en-us/facts-and-planning/useful-tips/road-safety.html)

**Public Transportation:**Australia has an extensive and safe public transportation network consisting of buses, streetcars, ferries, trains, and subways. Metered taxis and ride sharing services are also prevalent. Use common sense safety practices, such as guarding valuables and remaining aware of your surroundings, on all public transportation.
