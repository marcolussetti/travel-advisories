# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, imprisoned or deported.

* It is illegal to take pictures of certain buildings, such as inside certain areas of Australian airports, near prisons, and at military bases.
* Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) website.

**Alcohol and Drugs:**

* Penalties for possession, use, or trafficking of drugs are strict. Convicted offenders can expect lengthy sentences and fines. Please see Australia’s Department of Health [webpage](https://www.health.gov.au/topics/drugs/about-drugs/drug-laws-in-australia) for further information.
* Driving under the influence of alcohol can result in jail time.
* Random breath testing of a driver's blood alcohol level is a common occurrence.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

**Potential Health Screening:** Australian authorities have broad powers to prevent the entry of diseases and other materials into Australia that might pose a threat to its welfare. In the event of a public health emergency involving a communicable disease, passengers arriving in Australia may be subject to strict health screening measures, including testing, monitoring, and assessment for possible quarantine.

**Customs:** Australian customs authorities enforce very strict regulations concerning the importation from all countries of items such as agricultural goods, including plants and food products, and wood products, as well as very strict quarantine standards for animals and pets.

Contact the [Embassy of Australia](https://usa.embassy.gov.au/) in Washington, D.C., or one of [Australia's consulates in the United States](https://usa.embassy.gov.au/our-locations) for specific information regarding customs requirements, and visit the Australian Government’s [Department of Agriculture](https://www.agriculture.gov.au/) website for additional information.

**Natural Disasters:**

Australia experiences a range of natural disasters, including bushfires, floods, and severe storms. These events are difficult to predict and can result in loss of life. You should be aware of conditions around you and monitor local weather and safety reports so you can take appropriate action when needed.

See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/crisis_and_disaster_abroad_be_ready.html) for information on storm preparedness and response.

**Safety Concerns:**

**Outdoor Recreation/Adventure**

* Be aware that Australian fauna can be dangerous. From jellyfish to crocodiles, sharks, poisonous insects, and snakes, the continent and its waters host wildlife that merit awe and respect in equal doses.
* Visit the [Wet Tropics Management Authority visitor information guide](https://www.wettropics.gov.au/) for information on Australian wildlife and marine life.
* Take important safety precautions when swimming, such as swimming only between the flags where a lifeguard is present, and never swimming alone.
* Further information on beach safety can be found on the [Surf Life Saving](https://sls.com.au/) website.

Follow recommended precautions when snorkeling and scuba diving and never dive alone. Over the past few years, there have been numerous deaths related to snorkeling and scuba diving incidents.
