# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you break local laws, even if you don’t know it, you can be removed, arrested, or detained. If you want to start a business or work in a job that needs special permits or licenses, you should get information from local authorities before you start.

It is illegal to take pictures of certain buildings, including inside certain areas of Australian airports, near prisons, and at military bases.

Furthermore, some crimes are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Alcohol and Drugs:** Penalties for drug possession, use, and trafficking are strict. Convicted offenders can expect lengthy sentences and fines. Visit Australia’s Department of Health [webpage](https://www.health.gov.au/topics/drugs/about-drugs/drug-laws-in-australia) for further information.

Driving under the influence of alcohol can result in jail time.

Random breath testing of a driver's blood alcohol level is common.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy or nearest U.S. Consulate immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Potential Health Screening:** Australian authorities have broad powers to prevent the entry of diseases and other materials into Australia that might pose a threat to its welfare. During a public health emergency involving a communicable disease, when arriving in Australia, you may be subject to strict health screening measures, including testing, monitoring, and possible quarantine.

**Customs:** Australian customs authorities enforce strict regulations concerning the importation of agricultural goods, including plants, food products, and wood products, as well as strict quarantine standards for animals and pets.

Contact the [Embassy of Australia](https://usa.embassy.gov.au/) in Washington, D.C., or one of [Australia's consulates in the United States](https://usa.embassy.gov.au/our-locations) for specific information regarding customs requirements, and visit the Australian Government’s [Department of Agriculture](https://www.agriculture.gov.au/) website for additional information.

**Natural Disasters:** Australia experiences a range of natural disasters, including bushfires, floods, and severe storms. These events are difficult to predict and can result in loss of life. Stay aware of conditions around you and monitor local weather and safety reports so you can take appropriate action.

See our [Crisis and Disaster page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/crisis_and_disaster_abroad_be_ready.html) for information on storm preparedness and response.

**Safety Concerns:**

Outdoor Recreation/Adventure

* Australian wildlife can be dangerous. From jellyfish to crocodiles, sharks, poisonous insects, and snakes, the continent and its waters host animals that merit awe and respect in equal doses.
* Visit the [Wet Tropics Management Authority visitor information guide](https://www.wettropics.gov.au/) for information on Australian wildlife and marine life.
* Use caution when swimming. Swim only in beach areas between flags and where a lifeguard is present. Never swim alone.
* Further information on beach safety can be found on the [Surf Life Saving](https://sls.com.au/) website.
* Follow recommended precautions when snorkeling and scuba diving and never dive alone. In recent years, swimmers have died while snorkeling and scuba diving.

**LGB Travelers:** There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Australia. Australian federal law prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation.

As of December 9, 2017, Australia defines marriage as “the union between two people.” Australia grants temporary and permanent visas to same-sex partners of Australian citizens.

See our [LGB Travel Information page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgb.html) and [section 6 of our Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports-bureau-of-democracy-human-rights-and-labor/country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:**

Australia enforces laws prohibiting discrimination against access to premises, facilities, and accommodation.

The most common types of accessibility may include public transportation, parking, streets, and buildings.

Expect accessibility to be limited in many of the downtown areas in Australian cities, which were built in the 1800s. These areas often have narrow sidewalks crowded with pedestrians and tourists.

Tourist spots at the beach or in the Australian outback can have varying degrees of accessibility.

Many accommodations and venues provide accessibility information on their websites.
