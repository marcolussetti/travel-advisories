# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Crime:** Crimes of opportunity, such as pickpockets and purse snatching particularly at beaches, hotel lobbies, or from cars are common. Accordingly,

* Be aware of your surroundings and take precautions to secure personal property.
* Do not leave valuables in cars in plain view or unattended in unsecured hotel rooms and rental homes.
* Avoid withdrawing cash from ATMs after dark and walking in poorly-lit areas.
* Keep a copy of your valid U.S. passport in a secure location in case your passport is stolen.

Be sure you are sufficiently insured when renting vehicles, jet skis, and other equipment. Theft of rental cars can occur, and damages may not be fully covered by local insurance when a vehicle is stolen.

Parents of young travelers should be aware that the legal drinking age of 18 is not always enforced. Extra parental supervision may be appropriate. Take standard precautions when frequenting nightclubs and bars. Travel in pairs or groups and, if you consume alcohol, do so responsibly. Do not leave your drink unattended or accept open containers from strangers. If you are a victim of a crime, report it immediately to Sint Maarten police (dial 911) and the U.S. Consulate.

**Watersports Advisory:** Be aware of the risks of recreational water activities. Never venture out alone, particularly at isolated beaches or far out to sea. Avoid entering the water above your waist if you have been drinking and always be mindful of watercraft traffic in the area. When in doubt, stay out!

**Do not attempt to experience the jet blast of approaching and departing aircraft at Maho Beach, which can result in serious injury or death.**

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, basic emergency medical treatment is widely available throughout the country. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. Critical injuries often require [medical evacuation](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).
