**Road Conditions and Safety:** Sint Maarten’s main roads are narrow and dimly lit. Driving at night is reasonably safe, as long as drivers are familiar with the route and road conditions. Proceed through intersections with caution.

**Traffic Laws:**Vehicles operate on the right-hand side in Sint Maarten. You can drive in Sint Maarten with a valid U.S. driver’s license. Right turns at red lights are prohibited. There are no border controls separating the Dutch and French sides of the island. Cars pass freely without stopping. Driving while intoxicated may result in the loss of a driver’s license, fine, and imprisonment.

**Public Transportation:**Taxis are unmetered. Passengers should determine the price in advance. Rental car agencies are located near the Princess Juliana International Airport. Be sure you are sufficiently insured. Ask your car rental agency for instructions in case of an accident.
