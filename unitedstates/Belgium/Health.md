High-quality medical facilities and services are widely available in Belgium. The large university hospitals can handle most medical problems. Equivalents for most, but not all, U.S. medications are available through local pharmacies with a prescription from a Belgian physician. The responsiveness of emergency services is also generally excellent.

**For emergency services in Belgium, dial 112.**

Ambulance services are widely available.

**We do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on overseas insurance coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the [Belgian Federal Public Health Service](https://www.health.belgium.be/en) to ensure the medication is legal in Belgium.

**Vaccinations:**Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
