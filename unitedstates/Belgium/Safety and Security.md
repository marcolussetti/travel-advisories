# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:**Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad, including possible attacks in Europe. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, rudimentary IEDs, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, concerts, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks/festivals
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and airports/scheduled commercial flights)

For more information, see our [Terrorism](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html) page.

**Crime:**

* Low-level street crime including robberies, smash and grab car robberies, purse snatchings, stealing electronics, and pickpocketing is common, particularly in major cities, in public areas such as restaurants, the Brussels metro at night, buses/trams, and all train stations. Thieves often operate in teams, by bumping into or shoving the target, especially in crowds. Be alert to distractions.
* Theft from vehicles is common. Always drive with your windows up and the doors locked, as thieves sometimes target cars stopped at traffic lights. Thieves may smash the window and grab valuables. Use parking garages when possible, and if you must use street parking, look for a spot near a street light. Do not leave anything visible on the seats, floor, or dashboard.
* Theft of bags on trains has increased, particularly the Brussels-Amsterdam route. Thieves often target light bags placed overhead. Keep bags with cash, valuables, and travel documents close to you, rather than in the overhead shelf on trains.
* Carry only a minimal amount of cash, credit cards, and necessary personal identification.
* Avoid wearing expensive jewelry and watches.

**Demonstrations** **occur frequently**. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.

* Police routinely monitor protestors and demonstrations.
* Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.
* Monitor the [Embassy website](https://be.usembassy.gov/) for demonstration alerts.

**International Financial Scams:** U.S. citizens have lost tens of thousands of dollars in scams in Belgium. See the [Department of State](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html)and the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) pages for more information.

* Common internet scams include confidence schemes, in which friends, family, or others receive a message that a U.S. citizen traveler is stranded in Belgium and in need of funds to pay for customs fees.
* U.S. citizens in the United States who have been victimized by Internet crime should report it to the [Internet Crime Complaint Center](https://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx).
* Check ATMs or other machines for skimmers or removeable readers. When possible utilize bank ATMs. In bars and restaurants, have the card swiped in front of you and do not let it be taken away.

**Victims of Crime:** U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police at **101**. For all other emergencies, please dial **112**. Contact the U.S. Embassy at **+(32) (2) 811-4000**. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is generally regulated and rules are regularly enforced.

In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance.
