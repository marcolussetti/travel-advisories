# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:**

* Belgium’s road network is generally well-built and maintained.
* Adequate lighting exists on major highways, but on rural roads it is often insufficient or nonexistent.
* Roadside assistance and information on road conditions are available in English from Touring Mobilis, telephone 02 286-3040. Belgian police will also provide information on road conditions, telephone 02-642-6666.
* Emergency services are efficient and responsive. For police emergencies, dial 101 by phone within Belgium. For all other emergencies, dial 112.

**Traffic Laws:**

* Traffic coming from the right generally has priority at uncontrolled intersections, even if coming from a smaller street.
* The **maximum speed limit on Belgian highways** is 120 kilometers (72 miles) per hour but is not always posted.
* The **maximum speed in urban areas** is 50 km (30 miles) per hour, but in central Brussels it is 30 km (19 miles) per hour.
* While Belgian authorities strictly **enforce speed limits**, many Belgians still drive significantly faster than the posted limit. Claiming ignorance of the speed limit may not prevent you from getting a significant fine for speeding, and your vehicle may be impounded if you can’t pay the fine on the spot. Automated radars with cameras are common and violators are issued citations through the mail.
* Belgian police also conduct **breath analysis checks for alcohol use**, particularly at night and during major holidays. The legal limit for operating a motor vehicle is .5 grams of alcohol per liter of blood (.05 percent Blood Alcohol Content).
* **You must use your seat belt** while driving in a vehicle.
* **Bicycling** is very common in Belgium, for both recreational and more traditional transportation purposes. Wear helmets at all times and follow vehicle travel rules (stopping at lights, crosswalks, etc.). Follow bike paths when available.

**Public Transportation:**Brussels and most major cities of Belgium have extensive and efficient public transportation systems. Trains, buses, and ferries connect Brussels with other major cities in Belgium and with the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Luxembourg, and The Netherlands. Traveling by train is considered to be safer than driving.

See our [Road Safety page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/other-legal/driving-and-road-safety.html) for more information. Visit the website of the [Belgian national authority responsible for road safety.](https://www.belgium.be/en/mobility/)

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of Belgium’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Belgium’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/).

**Brussels Airport Delays:** Travelers have experienced significant delays at passport control at Brussels airport, during both arrival and departure.  We recommend outbound passengers check with your airline to find out their cutoff time for check-in and seek your airline’s recommendations on how to mitigate potential passport control delays.

**Maritime Travel:** Mariners planning travel to Belgium should also check for [U.S. maritime advisories and alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts). Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard homeport website](https://homeport.uscg.mil/), and the [NGA broadcast warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings).
