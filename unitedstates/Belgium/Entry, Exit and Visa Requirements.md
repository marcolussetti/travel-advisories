# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

**Traveling Through Europe**: Belgium is a party to the Schengen Agreement. If you are planning to visit or travel through European countries, you should be familiar with the requirements of the Schengen Agreement.

* Your passport should be valid for **at least three months beyond the period of stay.** If you plan on transiting or visiting a Schengen country review our [U.S. Travelers in Europe page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/US_Travelers_in_Europes_Schengen_Area.html).
* You will need **sufficient proof of funds** and a **return plane ticket**.

Visit the [Embassy of Belgium](https://unitedstates.diplomatie.belgium.be/en) website for the most current visa information.

The Government of Belgium does not recognize the 12-page U.S. emergency passport, issued by U.S. embassies and consulates overseas, as a valid travel document for visa-free entry into Belgium. If traveling on this emergency passport, you may be refused boarding and/or entry by immigration officials. Only direct transit through Belgium for a destination in the United States is permitted with an emergency passport. You should check entry requirements of any other country of destination to make sure the emergency passport is accepted for entry.

**HIV/AIDS RESTRICITONS:** The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Belgium.
