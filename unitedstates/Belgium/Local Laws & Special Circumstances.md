# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities prior to practicing or operating a business.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**LGB Travelers:** There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Belgium.

See our [LGB Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgbti.html) page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:** While in Belgium, individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation very different than in the United States.

* Belgian law requires that any **new** building with public or community space must be accessible for persons with disabilities.
* Many existing buildings as well as public transportation systems are less adapted to individuals with disabilities.
* General information on the accessibility of tourist accommodations, public transportation, museums, and other tourist facilities can be found on official tourism sites for Belgium’s three major regions: [Brussels](https://visit.brussels/en/profile/accessible-brussels), [Wallonia](http://walloniabelgiumtourism.co.uk/en-gb/3/i-am/travellers-with-reduced-mobility), and [Flanders](http://www.visitflanders.com/en/accessibility/?country=en_USindex.php).
