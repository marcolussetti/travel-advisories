# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

Travelers are urged to review the [Mongolia Travel Advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/mongolia-travel-advisory.html), which provides information about safety and security concerns affecting the country.

The phone number to report crimes to the **local police in Mongolia is 102**. The number to call an **ambulance or fire truck in an emergency is 103**. Please note that local authorities, including emergency responders, usually do not speak English.

**Crime:** Mongolia is a relatively safe country for foreigners. But both street crime and violent crime are on the rise, especially in the larger towns and cities. Crime typically peaks during the Naadam summer festival in July and during the Tsagaan Sar (Lunar New Year) festival in January or February. Most street crime occurs late at night, often outside bars and nightclubs.

**Theft:** Pickpocketing and bag-snatching can occur at any time, especially in crowded places like markets, train stations, and popular tourist attractions. You should take precautions to protect your personal effects when in public. The embassy has also received reports of visitors’ accommodations being burgled while occupied. These burglaries most often occurred when travelers were staying in yurt (ger) camps.  It may be impossible to lock the doors to these accommodations.

**Robbery:** Mugging is the most common robbery of visitors to Mongolia. You are most likely to be mugged if you are alone in unfamiliar urban neighborhoods after dark, or in unlicensed taxis. Stick to well-lit and well-established tourist areas. Use registered taxis whenever possible.

**Sexual Assault:** Though infrequent, the Embassy does receive reports of sexual assaults perpetrated against travelers. These reports showthat perpetrators are most often familiar with the victim. They include tour guides and employees of locations frequented by tourists, like ger camps and monasteries. If you are a victim of sexual assault, you may contact the Mongolian police. You can also seek help from the Embassy at +976 7007-6001. Female travelers should avoid solo travel in Mongolia. All travelers should research and hire only reputable tour agencies with established safety and security records, especially when visiting remote areas far from the capital.

The police will instruct victims of sexual assault to get an examination at the criminal forensic institute, which is in Ulaanbaatar city or in provincial centers. A medical check from any other clinic/hospital will not be admitted into evidence at any judicial proceeding. The Embassy can assist in helping you locate these centers.

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance.

**Street Harassment:** Street harassment is especially prevalent at night and in areas outside the capital. The most common targets of street harassment are unaccompanied women and foreign men accompanying Mongolian or other Asian women. Street harassment may range from verbal abuse to physical assault. Some nationalist groups also carry out planned attacks against foreigners. Most street harassment occurs in or near bars and nightclubs, and alcohol is often involved. All travelers should avoid walking alone after dark. They should also avoid unregistered taxis and limit their alcohol. This will help avoid harassment in public.

**Drug Offenses:** Mongolian police want to combat drug use. They often see it as a problem imported by foreigners. In Mongolia, drug possession and trafficking carry a prison term of one to twelve years.

**Smuggling of Contraband Goods, Antiquities, and Wildlife:** Smuggling of these items is prevalent across both the Russian and Chinese borders. Travelers have been known to be duped into transporting contraband goods or controlled antiquities from Mongolia. Be wary of other passengers requesting help with their luggage, as it could contain illicit articles. Mongolia’s smuggling penalties vary based on the item.  They range from one month of electronic monitoring to eight years imprisonment. Fines from 450,000 MNT to 40,000,000 MNT equal to 130 USD to 12000 USD as of September 2024.

**Demonstrations:** Demonstrations are common in many parts of Mongolia. They are most common in the capital, Ulaanbaatar. Even peaceful demonstrations can become confrontational and escalate into violence. Protesters may block traffic on roads, including major thoroughfares. U.S. citizens should avoid demonstration areas and exercise caution if near any protests. Some Mongolian ultra-nationalist demonstrations may become xenophobic. This poses a risk to foreigners who might encounter them. U.S. citizens should avoid participating in demonstrations and other activities that might be deemed political by Mongolian authorities.

**Alcohol:** If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation. If you feel ill, stop and seek medical help. Alcohol is important to Mongolian social culture. Strangers may offer drinks to travelers as a welcoming gesture. Most of these offers are harmless and friendly. But travelers should be wary of accepting beverages offered on the street by strangers on the street at night.  These are often a prelude to a robbery. The widespread use of alcohol links to many fights. U.S. citizen travelers have, knowingly or unknowingly become involved in such fights and injured.

**Driving Under the Influence:** Mongolian police take driving under the influence very seriously. They vigorously enforce the law in urban areas. Penalties for driving under the influence in Mongolia include a one-year suspension of driving privileges and a 400,000 MNT fine, roughly 120 USD as of December 2024. Travelers should exercise the same precautions as they would in the United States, use of a designated driver or a taxi, to avoid operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.

**Victims of Crime: Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes.** If you are the victim of a crime, you may contact the local authorities to file a Mongolian police report. You should also inform the U.S. embassy. A crime may only be reported in person at the local police district having jurisdiction over the location where the crime occurred. You must have your passport or residency permit with you.  Before reporting a crime, you may wish to consult an attorney. The U.S. Embassy maintains a [list of English-speaking lawyers](https://mn.usembassy.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/192/English-speaking-lawyers.docx) that you may access online. Once you report a crime to the police Mongolian law requires that you remain in the country for the duration of both the investigation and any subsequent trial. In some instances, the law provides for a victim to appoint a legal representative to take their place.

The police will instruct victims of assault or sexual assault to undergo an examination by the criminal forensic institute which is located in Ulaanbaatar or in provincial centers. No other medical examination will be accepted as evidence by Mongolian authorities. The Embassy can assist in helping you locate these centers.

It is important to note that, if a victim does not file a complaint, police may refuse to investigate the crime--even if they have probable cause to suspect that a crime took place.

If you are the victim of a crime the U.S. embassy can:

* help you find appropriate medical care and provide a list of doctors and hospitals
* assist you in reporting a crime to the police
* contact relatives or friends with your written consent
* explain the local criminal justice process in general terms
* provide a list of local attorneys
* provide our information on [victim’s compensation programs in the U.S.](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/victims.html) as well as local resources
* provide an emergency loan for repatriation, which includes accommodation and flights back to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution
* replace a stolen, lost, or damaged passport

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is unevenly regulated. Mongolia’s vast area and limited road and communications infrastructure make emergency response challenging for local and national authorities. Mongolia can experience severe weather. This raises the risk of urgent situations if one gets lost or disoriented outside of city centers. The embassy recommends travelers not drive outside of Ulaanbaatar or other city centers after sunset.  In winter, visitors should keep high-quality cold-weather clothing in vehicles. This is important, even for short trips. It will provide protection in the event of delay or becoming stranded.  Routine safety inspections for emergency and medical equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas and activities may lack proper signs. Tour guides and staff may not be properly trained or certified by the host government or recognized authorities. After an injury, basic medical care is usually only in/near major cities. Medications and healthcare are often of poor quality.  First responders are generally unable to quickly access areas outside of major cities to provide urgent medical treatment.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).
