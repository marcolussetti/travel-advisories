**Road Conditions and Safety: Operating a vehicle outside of Ulaanbaatar is unsafe**, particularly after dark. Outside of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia has few paved roads and even fewer streetlights. Most roads have only two lanes and no shoulders and most sealed roads need resurfacing. Trucks commonly carry overloaded cargo. Livestock crossing roads, even high traffic ones, is common. Pedestrians also cross all types of roads at undesignated locations. Passing is difficult and dangerous due to the narrow, highly-trafficked nature of the roads.

Mongolian motorists can be aggressive. They often cut each other off, make illegal turns, run red lights, and suddenly stop in the road. Moreover, driving while intoxicated is common. Mongolia drives on the right. But over half of all vehicles have right-side steering wheels. Most motorcycle and moped drivers have limited experience sharing the road. Motorists rarely respect pedestrians’ right-of-way, even in crosswalks.

**Driving off-road** in Mongolia can be dangerous, without a local guide. Those considering off-road driving in Mongolia should bring a few things. They should have standard vehicle maintenance equipment, a good GPS unit, and a reliable satellite phone. Be extra careful when driving off-road in winter. Stranded in remote areas, foreign drivers may face deadly situations. They may lack food, water, and heat.  Mongolia’s National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) can assist stuck vehicles during weather emergencies. But there is no government agency dedicated to helping stuck vehicles.

**Traffic Laws:**To help reduce traffic and air pollution, police actively restrict certain license plate numbers from driving into downtown Ulaanbaatar on certain days of the week, usually alternating odd/even numbers.

It is not legal to drive in Mongolia with a U.S. driver’s license. U.S. citizen tourists may drive in Mongolia for six months with a valid international driver’s license. After that, they must have a Mongolian license. Automobile insurance is mandatory. For information on Mongolian driver’s licenses, vehicle inspection, road taxes, and vehicle insurance, contact the [Embassy of Mongolia](https://mongolianembassy.us/) in Washington, DC. in Washington, DC.

**If you are in a collision** do not move your vehicle. Wait for the police or insurance company to assess the scene, even if it is blocking traffic. Moving your vehicle will incur a fine. Be prepared to wait. It can take hours for the police or the insurance company to arrive at the crash site.

**Public Transportation:**Ulaanbaatar has a fairly reliable bus system. Bus maps are in English. Buses can get very crowded, so watch for pickpockets. Ulaanbaatar has many unofficial, unregistered, un-metered taxis. Registered taxis are also available but may refuse service during rush hour.

The safety and maintenance standards of rental car companies vary. Local tour companies can provide cars with drivers. But the drivers’ experience, knowledge, and English skills will vary.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Mongolia, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Mongolia’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa).
