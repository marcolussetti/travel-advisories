# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

Visit the [Mongolian Immigration Agency’s website](https://immigration.gov.mn/en/) or the [website of the Mongolian Embassy in Washington, DC](https://mongolianembassy.us/) for the most current information on entry, exit, and visa requirements.

**Tourism & Business Travel:** No visa is needed for visits under 90 days. But your passport must be valid for at least six months beyond your date of arrival. All foreign nationals, no matter their duration of stay, must register with the Immigration Agency of Mongolia within 48 hours of their arrival in country. The individual or their housing provider can do this. Registration can be done online through the [Immigration Agency of Mongolia’s website](https://immigration.gov.mn/en/). If you don’t register, you may face fines upon departure. You may not leave until you pay the fine to the Mongolian Immigration Agency.

You will also be fined if you stay beyond your 90-day admission, even if due to circumstances beyond your control. You must pay this fine in full. It accumulates daily for every day beyond 90 days. Mongolian authorities will not allow you to leave otherwise.

**Work, Study, Reside:** If you plan to visit, work, study, or reside in Mongolia for more than 90 days you must apply for a visa at the [Mongolian Embassy in Washington, DC](https://mongolianembassy.us/), [the Mongolian Consulate General in San Francisco](https://sanfrancisco.consul.mn/), or the [Mongolian Mission to the United Nations in New York](https://www.un.int/mongolia/) before you leave the United States.

**Overland Travel to/from China or Russia:** Only the Zamiin Uud border crossing in the south with China and the Sukhbaatar/Altanbulag border crossing in the north with Russia, are always open to foreign travelers. Other overland ports of entry are open sporadically. The [status of border crossings](https://bpo.gov.mn/content/147) is available in Mongolian.

See the Country Specific Information pages on [China](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/China.html) and [Russia](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/RussianFederation.html) for additional information on the entry, exit, and transit requirements for those countries.
