[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, then you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.

Furthermore, some laws are prosecutable in the United States, even if violated abroad. For examples, see the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) website and our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html).

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, **ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. embassy immediately.** See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Customs:** Mongolian customs authorities strictly enforce laws regulating the import and export of firearms, ammunition, precious metals, antiquities and drugs. Importation of firearms or ammunition requires prior government approval. All precious metals should be declared on arrival. Exporting antiquities requires a special customs clearance certificate issued by an authorized antique dealer at the time of sale. Importing medicines is not allowed. Medicines for personal use must have doctor’s prescription. Vitamins are limited only for personal use and bringing more than 2 packages will result in taxation.

**LGB Travelers:** Mongolia’s criminal code prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, nationality, language, race, age, gender, social status, professional position, religion, education, or medical status. There are no laws or legal provisions that criminalize being LGB or that specifically target the LGB community. Yet, NGOs continue to report that LGB individuals face violence and discrimination both in public and at home based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. There were also reports that LGB persons face greater discrimination and fear in rural areas than in Ulaanbaatar. The Government of Mongolia does not recognize same-sex spouses for visa and residency purposes.

Seeour[LGB Travel Information](/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgb.html) and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports/2023-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** Ulaanbaatar’s main streets have textured sidewalks for the visually impaired. But many obstacles hinder disabled people from moving freely. Government buildings and public transportation remain largely inaccessible to persons with disabilities. Mongolian elevators are often too small fora standard wheelchair. Service animals are rare and are often barred from entering public buildings.
