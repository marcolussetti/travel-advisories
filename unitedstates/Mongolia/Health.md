With few exceptions, Mongolian hospitals do not meet Western standards. Although most doctors and emergency responders are dedicated professionals, their training and equipment are sub-standard. Most modern medical facilities are in Ulaanbaatar, though some public and private hospitals in larger provincial cities offer medical services on par with those in the capital. Medical services may be completely unavailable in remote areas. Mongolia lacks helicopter medical evacuation. In remote areas, those needing help must drive to the nearest major town. Medical evacuation to Ulaanbaatar is conducted by commercial air carriers. Some pharmacies in Ulaanbaatar carry European or U.S. pharmaceuticals. But their stock is limited. Most pharmaceuticals are made in China or Russia and lack English labels. See our [list of medical facilities in Ulaanbaatar](https://mn.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/doctors/).

**Air Quality:** Due to the pervasiveness of coal-burning for domestic heating, Ulaanbaatar and most other Mongolian cities suffer severe air pollution during winter. The U.S. Embassy’s air quality monitor shows Air Quality Indices (AQIs) over 300 most days from December through February. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency describes AQIs above 300 as “hazardous.” Air pollution can harm health, both in the short and long term. It is especially risky for children, pregnant women, the elderly, outdoor enthusiasts, and people with heart or lung disease. Travelers planning to visit Ulaanbaatar during winter should consult a doctor. At a minimum, they should, consider carrying an N95 mask to help filter out harmful particulates. For reliable and timely air pollution readings, check the U.S. Embassy’s live [air quality monitor](https://mn.usembassy.gov/embassy/ulaanbaatar/aqi/).

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas. Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in [destination]. For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/). For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).

**Water Quality:** The quality of drinking water varies throughout Mongolia, and it is likely not up to U.S. standards for potability. Most Mongolians do not drink tap water and instead prefer to consume bottled water for their domestic use.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance coverage.

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation. The U.S. embassy does not provide medical evacuation nor pay medical bills.

If traveling with prescription medication, check with the [Mongolian Embassy](https://mongolianembassy.us/) to ensure the medication is legal in Mongolia. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription.
