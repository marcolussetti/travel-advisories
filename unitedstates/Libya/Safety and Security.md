# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:** Terrorist groups and individuals inspired by them want to attack U.S. citizens outside of the United States. They are using simpler methods of attack like knives, guns, and vehicles to target crowds. They often go after unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

The following groups, which are on the U.S. government’s list of designated [Foreign Terrorist Organizations](https://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/other/des/123085.htm), pose a high risk to U.S. citizens in the region:

* The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS)-Libya
* Al-Qa’ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM)

Terrorist attacks have occurred in Libya and the surrounding region. The most recent terrorist attack in Libya occurred in 2021. Extremists have kidnapped foreigners.

**Crime:**

* Crime levels and the threat of kidnapping throughout the country remain high.
* Crimes of opportunity are commonplace, particularly against people who appear to be wealthy or of foreign nationality.

**Political Violence:**

Clashes among armed groups, including government-aligned forces, occur periodically throughout the country, including Tripoli and other urban areas.

**Demonstrations**occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Past demonstrations have turned violent.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**International Financial Scams:** Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Libya. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Most scammers pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. For more information on international financial scams, see our page on [Protecting Yourself from Scams](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html)and the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/safety-resources/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes) pages.

**Technology Usage Abroad:** Mobile devices can be compromised, stolen, or damaged anywhere in the world. Before traveling abroad, it is best to keep all software (operating system and apps) updated. If possible, use a virtual private network (VPN) and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi.

GPS navigation apps are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using the GPS app, research the route to make sure it is safe.  GPS navigation apps may give you the shortest route without safety consideration.

Be careful when using dating apps or online dating websites while abroad. Scammers may target U.S. citizens. Tell your friends and family where you are, meet in a popular public place, and avoid consuming suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs.

**Victims of Crime:** U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy in Tunis for assistance. Victims of sexual assault have little recourse in Libya, and women who report sexual crimes may be accused of adultery and are at risk of further violence against them if they are unable to prove that a crime occurred under a high standard of proof in the Libyan judicial system.

Victims may wish to report crimes to the local police station closest to where they are residing and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(216) 71-107-000, or +216 29 980 978 for WhatsApp calling capabilities. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.

**Domestic Violence:** Libya does not have any laws prohibiting or criminalizing domestic violence. U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the U.S. Embassy in Tunis for assistance.

**Tourism:**

Emergency response and subsequent appropriate medical treatment is not available in-country, except in Tripoli. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
