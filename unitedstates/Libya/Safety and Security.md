# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:**  Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad.  Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds.  Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

The following groups, which are on the U.S. government’s list of designated [Foreign Terrorist Organizations](https://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/other/des/123085.htm), pose a high risk to U.S. citizens in the region:

* The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS)-Libya
* Al-Qa’ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM)

Terrorist attacks have occurred in Libya and the surrounding region. Extremists have kidnapped foreigners.

**Crime:**

* Crime levels and the threat of kidnapping throughout the country remain high.
* Crimes of opportunity are commonplace, particularly against people who appear to be wealthy or of foreign nationality.

**Political Violence:**

Clashes among armed groups, including government-aligned forces, occur periodically throughout the country, including Tripoli, other urban areas.

**Demonstrations**occur frequently.  They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Past demonstrations have turned violent.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**International Financial Scams:** Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Libya. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Most scammers pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. For more information on international financial scams, see our page on Protecting Yourself  from Scams  and the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/safety-resources/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes) pages.

**Technology Usage Abroad:** Mobile Devices are vulnerable to compromise, theft, and physical damage anywhere in the world. Best practices prior to traveling abroad are keeping all software (operating system and apps) updated and use virtual private network and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications if possible. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi.

GPS Navigation Apps are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using the GPS app make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. GPS navigation app may give you the shortest route without safety consideration.

Be cautious of using dating apps/online dating websites abroad as U.S. citizens can be targeted by scammers. Make sure to inform your friends and family of your whereabouts, meet at a well-known public location, and do not consume suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs.

**Victims of Crime:** U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy in Tunis for assistance. Victims of sexual assault have little recourse in Libya, and women who report sexual crimes may be accused of adultery and are at risk of further violence against them if they are unable to prove that a crime occurred under a high standard of proof in the Libyan judicial system.

Victims may wish to report crimes to the local police station closest to where they are residing and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(216) 71-107-000, or +216 29 980 978 for WhatsApp calling capabilities. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.
