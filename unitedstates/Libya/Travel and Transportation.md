# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:**   Roadside assistance is extremely limited and offered only in Arabic. Wind-blown sand can reduce visibility without warning. During rainstorms, roads will flood. Very few streets are marked or have signage, and highway signs are normally only in Arabic. Paved roads in rural areas are satisfactory; however, many rural roads are unpaved.

**Traffic Laws:** There is a high accident rate and traffic laws are rarely enforced.

**Public Transportation:** Public transportation is limited.  Taxis are available, but taxi drivers may be reckless and untrained.  English-speaking drivers are extremely rare.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**

While there are operational international airports in Libya with regular domestic and international flights, flights are often delayed, rerouted, and cancelled without warning.  As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Libya, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Libya’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards.  Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/).

The FAA has issued a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) which prohibits U.S. civil aviation from flying into or over Libya.  Further information may be found on the FAA’s [Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions) webpage.

**Maritime Travel:** Mariners planning travel to Libya should also check for U.S. maritime [advisories](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories) and [alerts at:](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts)<https://www.maritime.dot.gov/> Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard homeport website,](https://homeport.uscg.mil/) and the [NGA broadcast warnings website.](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings) Navigational warnings can be found under the “Current Warnings” section for the applicable NAVAREA from within the NGA site. Navigational warnings can be found under the “Current Warnings” section for the applicable NAVAREA from within the NGA site.

**Port Security:** The Commandant of the Coast Guard has determined that effective anti-terrorism measures are not in place in Libyan ports and has imposed conditions of entry on vessels that arrive in U.S. ports having visited ports in Libya.  Mariners and passengers on commercial vessels traveling through the ports of Libya should exercise increased caution.
