For emergency services in Libya, dial 1515.

Ambulance services are:

* Not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment.
* Not present throughout the country or are unreliable in most areas except Tripoli. Even in Tripoli, ambulances are not widely available, and training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.

Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

Health Facilities:

* Adequate health facilities are available in Tripoli, but health care in rural areas may be below U.S. standards.
* Public medical clinics lack basic resources and supplies. Review our [Health Abroad page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad.html) for more information.

We highly recommend that all travelers review the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s [Travelers’ Health page](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/traveler-information-center). CDC Traveler Advice provides advice on medical considerations including:

* Select your destination in the [Travelers’ Health webpage](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/traveler-information-center). Review all sub-sections including Travel Health Notices, Vaccines and Medicines, Non-Vaccine-Preventable Diseases, Stay Healthy and Safe, Healthy Travel Packing List, and After Your Trip.
* Reasons for Travel (for example: Adventure Travel, Spring Break Travel)
* Travelers with Special Considerations (for example: Allergies, Long-Term Travelers and Expatriates)
* General Tips (for example: Traveling with Medications, Travel Vaccines)

**The Department of State does not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. Review our [Insurance Overseas page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html?cq_ck=1708701048867) for more information on insurance providers with overseas coverage. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Travel Insurance page](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

* We strongly recommend getting traveler’s insurance, including supplemental medical evacuation insurance, before traveling.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the [Embassy of Libya](https://www.embassyoflibyadc.org/) to ensure the medication is legal in Libya.

Bring enough supplies of over-the-counter and prescription medicines to last your entire stay in Libya.

**Vaccinations:** Be up to date on all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including Yellow Fever, Typhoid, Hepatitis A, and Hepatitis B.
