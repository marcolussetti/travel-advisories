For emergency services in Libya, dial 1515.

Ambulance services are:

* Not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment
* Not present throughout the country or are unreliable in most areas except Tripoli. Even in Tripoli, ambulances are notwidely available and training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.

Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

Health Facilities:

* Adequate health facilities are available in Tripoli but health care in rural areas may be below U.S. standards.
* Public medical clinics lack basic resources and supplies.

We highly recommend that all travelers review the U.S. Centers for Disease

Control and Prevention’s entire [Travelers’ Health webpage](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/) and general [Traveler Advice](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/traveler-information-center) for Libya.

* Review the Traveler Advice webpage that provides advice on medical considerations including:
  + Reasons for Travel (for example: Adventure Travel, Spring Break Travel)
  + Travelers with Special Considerations (for example: Allergies, Long-Term Travelers and Expatriates)
  + and General Tips (for example: Traveling with Medications, Travel Vaccines)

**The Department of State does not pay medical bills.**Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas.  Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas.  Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments.  See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage.  Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

The Department strongly recommends supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.  Check with the [Embassy of Libya](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Libya.html#ExternalPopup) to ensure the medication is legal in Libya.

**Vaccinations:** Be up to date on all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
