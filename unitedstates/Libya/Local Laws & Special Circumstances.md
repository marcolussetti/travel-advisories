# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:**

You are subject to local laws. If you break local laws, even if you don't know it, you can be kicked out of the area, arrested, or put in prison. If you want to start a business or work in a job that needs special permits or licenses, you should get information from the local authorities before you start.

In Libya:

* You may be detained for questioning if you do not have your passport with you.
* It is illegal to take pictures of certain buildings, especially military and government facilities.
* Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.
* Driving under the influence can result in immediate detention. Alcohol is also prohibited, and possessing, using, or trafficking in alcohol can carry severe penalties.
* Customs authorities enforce strict regulations concerning the introduction into Libya or removal from Libya of firearms, religious materials, antiquities, medications, and currency.
* The importation and consumption of alcohol, pornography, and pork products are illegal.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy in Tunis immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

If you are detained in Libya, the Department of State may not be notified. Department of State officials cannot visit detained U.S. citizens in Libya, due to security reasons throughout the country and the suspended operating status of the U.S. Embassy in Libya. Since most law enforcement is currently performed by armed groups under varying degrees of government control, there are few clear legal processes. During your detention, you may not be provided with basic toiletries or appropriate nutrition.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries. They may be illegal according to local laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety. You may be subject to fines and/or have to give up counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States. Review the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection website](https://www.cbp.gov/trade/fakegoodsrealdangers#:~:text=It%20is%20illegal%20to%20purchase%20counterfeit%20goods.%20Bringing,activities%2C%20such%20as%20forced%20labor%20or%20human%20trafficking.) and [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-ccips) for more information.

**Dual Nationality:**

* U.S. citizens of Libyan origin may also be subject to laws that impose special obligations on Libyan citizens.
* The Government of Libya considers all children born to Libyan fathers to be Libyan citizens, even if they were not issued a Libyan birth certificate or a Libyan passport. Women married to foreign nationals cannot pass their nationality to their children. Women may confer nationality to children if the fathers are unknown, stateless, or do not establish filiation. Women cannot confer nationality to spouses.
* Dual Libyan-U.S. citizens may not enter or leave Libya on their U.S. passports and must obtain a Libyan travel document before traveling to Libya.
* Persons with dual nationality who travel to Libya on their Libyan passports are normally treated as Libyan citizens by the local government.
* The U.S. Department of State’s ability to provide consular assistance to those traveling on Libyan passports is extremely limited.
* For additional information, please see our [information on dual nationality.](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/Dual-Nationality-Travelers.html)

**Faith-Based Travelers:** Proselytizing is illegal in Libya. Penalties are severe. In addition to possibly facing the death penalty, proselytizers may be the target of extra-judicial killings.

**Gay and Lesbian Travelers:** Consensual same-sex sexual relations are criminalized in Libya with a penalty of up to five years’ imprisonment or flogging. Authorities may disproportionately enforce other public-order laws against lesbian, gay, and bisexual persons to justify arbitrary arrest. Discrimination against individuals on the basis of sexual orientation is codified in some local laws. There have been reports of physical violence, harassment, and blackmail based on sexual orientation. There have been reports of armed groups detaining individuals suspected of being gay or lesbian.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** The law in Libya does not explicitly prohibit discrimination against persons with “special needs.” However, Libyan law describes the provision of financial and other social assistance to protect disabled persons with respect to employment, education, access to health care, and provision of other government services. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure.

**Women Travelers:**Women and girls in Libya, particularly those with relatives of Libyan origin, as well as other Western travelers, are at increased risk of forced marriage, abduction, and kidnapping in Libya.

Women travelling alone or with children, including foreigners and U.S. citizens, have been stopped, questioned, or harassed by authorities for travelling without a male guardian throughout Libya or when attempting to exit the country. Male guardianship is not mandatory under current Libyan law, but Libyan authorities frequently require it. Women and men travelling together may be asked to provide a marriage certificate to verify their relationship.

Even when accompanied by a male guardian, women have been intimidated, threatened, and detained by armed groups, extremists, or other individuals for “un-Islamic” behavior. Women are expected to wear clothing that meets strict modesty standards and may be stopped or harassed if they are dressed in a manner that is deemed immodest. Women and girls who have been detained in Libya also report being victims of acts of sexual violence inflicted by authorities or armed group members.

Victims of sexual assault have little recourse in Libya. Women who report sexual crimes may be accused of adultery and are at risk of further violence against them if they are unable to prove that a crime occurred under a high standard of proof in the Libyan judicial system.
