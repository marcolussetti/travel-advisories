# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.  Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

In Libya:

* You may be detained for questioning if you do not have your passport with you.
* It is illegal to take pictures of certain buildings, especially military and government facilities.
* Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.
* Driving under the influence can result in immediate detention. Alcohol is also prohibited, and possessing, using, or trafficking in alcohol can carry severe penalties.
* Customs authorities enforce strict regulations concerning the introduction into Libya or removal from Libya of firearms, religious materials, antiquities, medications, and currency.
* The importation and consumption of alcohol, pornography, and pork products are illegal.

Furthermore, certain acts of U.S. citizens overseas are prosecutable as crimes in the United States even if they are not illegal under the local law..  For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask for police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy in Tunis immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

If you are detained in Libya, the Department of State may not be notified of your detention, and Department of State officials cannot visit you, due to security reasons throughout the country and the suspended operating status of the U.S. Embassy in Libya.  Since most law enforcement is currently performed by militias, there are few clear legal processes.  During your detention, you may not be provided with basic toiletries or appropriate nutrition.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may be illegal according to the local laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods also may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety. You may be subject to fines and/or have to give up counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States. See the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection website](https://www.cbp.gov/trade/fakegoodsrealdangers#:~:text=It%20is%20illegal%20to%20purchase%20counterfeit%20goods.%20Bringing,activities%2C%20such%20as%20forced%20labor%20or%20human%20trafficking.) and [U.S. Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-ccips) website for more information.

**Dual Nationality:**

* U.S. citizens of Libyan origin may also be subject to laws that impose special obligations on Libyan citizens.
* The Government of Libya considers all children born to Libyan fathers to be Libyan citizens, even if they were not issued a Libyan birth certificate or a Libyan passport.
* Dual Libyan-American nationals may not enter or leave Libya on their U.S. passports and must obtain a Libyan travel document before traveling to Libya.
* Persons with dual nationality who travel to Libya on their Libyan passports are normally treated as Libyan citizens by the local government.
* The U.S. Department of State’s ability to provide U.S. consular assistance to those traveling on Libyan passports is extremely limited.
* For additional information, please see our [information on dual nationality](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/Advice-about-Possible-Loss-of-US-Nationality-Dual-Nationality/Dual-Nationality.html).

**Faith-Based Travelers:** Proselytizing is illegal in Libya. Penalties are severe. In addition to possibly facing the death penalty, proselytizers may be the target of extra-judicial killings.

**LGB Travelers:** Same-sex sexual relations are criminalized in Libya, and discrimination against LGB individuals is codified in some local laws. Penalties include fines or jail time. There have been reports of physical violence, harassment, and blackmail based on sexual orientation. There have been reports of armed groups detaining individuals suspected of belonging to the LGB community.

**Travelers with Disabilities:**  The Libyan Constitutional Declaration  does not explicitly prohibit discrimination against persons with “special needs.”  However, Libyan law describes the provision of financial and other social assistance to protect disabled persons with respect to employment, education, access to health care, and provision of other government services.  Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure.

**Women Travelers:**

Women and girls in Libya, particularly those with relatives of Libyan origin, as well as other Western travelers, are at increased risk of forced marriage, abduction, and kidnapping in Libya.

Women travelling alone or with children, including Westerners and U.S. citizens, have been stopped, questioned, or harassed by authorities for travelling without a male guardian throughout Libya or when attempting to exit the country.  Male guardianship is not mandatory under current Libyan law, but Libyan authorities frequently require it.  Women and men travelling together may be asked to provide a marriage certificate to verify their relationship.

Even when accompanied by a male guardian, women have been intimidated, threatened, and detained by armed militias, extremists, or other individuals for “un-Islamic” behavior.  Women are expected to wear clothing that meets strict modesty standards and may be stopped or harassed if they are dressed in a manner that is deemed immodest.  Women and girls who have been detained in Libya also report being victims of acts of sexual violence inflicted by authorities and/or militia members.

Victims of sexual assault have little recourse in Libya, and women who report sexual crimes may be accused of adultery and are at risk of further violence against them if they are unable to prove that a crime occurred under a high standard of proof in the Libyan judicial system.
