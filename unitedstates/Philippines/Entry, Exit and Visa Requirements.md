[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

Visit the website of the [Embassy of the Republic of the Philippines](https://philippineembassy-dc.org/)in Washington, D.C., for the most current visa information.

If you remain in the Philippines beyond the “admit until” date stamped in your passport by immigration authorities, you may be subject to fines and detention by the [Philippine Bureau of Immigration](https://immigration.gov.ph/) (BI).

Certain foreigners must apply for an [Emigration Clearance Certificate](https://immigration.gov.ph/)(ECC) from BI before they may depart the Philippines.

See the [Philippine Bureau of Immigration](https://immigration.gov.ph/ "https://immigration.gov.ph/") (BI)'s website for information about Philippine visas, exit clearances, and Alien Certificate Registration (ACR).

See the [Philippine Retirement Authority](https://pra.gov.ph/ "https://pra.gov.ph/") (PRA)'s website for information about the Special Retiree Resident Visa (SRRV).

U.S. citizens who intend to work in the Philippines should contact the [Philippines Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE)](https://www.dole.gov.ph/) for information.

The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors or foreign residents of the Philippines.

We advise all U.S. citizens against traveling with potentially prohibited items, such as firearms, on their person or in their checked baggage. While at the airport or traveling in country, possession of prohibited items such as live or spent ammunition or firearms, or anything resembling such items -- whether it be a souvenir, gift, or artifact – may subject the traveler to prosecution and stringent penalties by local authorities. [Learn more about how to avoid problems when traveling abroad with firearms.](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/traveling-abroad-with-firearms.html)

Check with your airline to determine whether a particular item is allowed for transport, as well as with the appropriate authorities in the Philippines – such as the [Philippine National Police](https://pnp.gov.ph/) and [Bureau of Immigration](https://immigration.gov.ph/faqs/emigration-clearance-certificate-ecc) – as well as the appropriate authorities in any transit countries.
