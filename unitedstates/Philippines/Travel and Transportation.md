# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Vehicle traffic is dense and unpredictable. The road system is frequently congested, and drivers are often undisciplined. Driving may be risky if you are not used to Philippine road conditions. Avoid driving off the national highways and other paved roads, especially at night. Be extra vigilant when crossing the street. Do not expect vehicles to stop for pedestrians.

**Traffic Laws:** Always have a valid driver’s license and relevant documents with you when driving and familiarize yourself with local traffic laws.

**Accidents:** If you are involved in an accident, contact the local police.  Stay inside your car until the police arrive before engaging with the other driver. Do not attempt to negotiate with drivers until police arrive. Drivers often ignore or do not yield to emergency vehicles, which may delay their arrival to the scene of an accident.

**Public Transportation:** U.S. embassy personnel are not permitted to use public buses, jeepneys, shared taxis, or light rail due to safety and security concerns.

U.S. citizens should exercise caution while traveling by public transportation, including inter-island ferryboats. Avoid overcrowded or unsafe transport. There have been 19 major inter-island ferryboat accidents since 2012, two with significant loss of life. U.S. government employees are advised not to use inter-island ferry boat services unless they are the only means of transportation available. There have also been a series of bus accidents due to poor bus maintenance or driver error. Please refer to our Safety and Security section for more information.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has found that the Philippines’ Civil Aviation Authority meets international standards for aviation safety oversight.  FAA’s [website](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa) includes more information on its assessment program.
