[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Vehicle traffic is dense and unpredictable. The road system is frequently congested, and drivers are often undisciplined. Consider the risks of driving your own vehicle if you are not used to Philippine road conditions. Avoid driving off the national highways and other paved roads, especially at night. Be extra vigilant when crossing the street. Do not expect vehicles to stop.

**Traffic Laws:** If you are involved in an accident, contact the local police, and attempt to stay inside your car until the police arrive before engaging with the other driver. Do not attempt to negotiate with drivers until police arrive. Drivers often ignore or do not yield to emergency vehicles, which may delay their arrival to the scene of an accident.

Always have a valid driver’s license and relevant documents with you when driving. Please review the following notices circulated by the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) to avoid scams and requests for bribes from apprehending officers: [List of Traffic Violations and Penalties,](https://mmda.gov.ph/images/Home/FINES_and_PENALTIES_As_of_CY2023.pdf)[No Contact Traffic Apprehension Policy,](https://mmda.gov.ph/20-faq/5478-no-contact-traffic-apprehension-policy-faqs-updated-june-7-2022.html) and [Procedure in Settling Traffic Violations](https://mmda.gov.ph/images/FAQ/PROCEDURES_FOR_SETTLING_MMDA_TRAFFIC_VIOLATIONS_updated_7202022.pdf) The MMDA also publishes guidelines on [what to do during vehicular accidents](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa).

**Public Transportation:** Exercise caution while traveling by inter-island ferryboats or other public transportation. Avoid overcrowded or unsafe transport. There have been 19 major inter-island ferryboat accidents since 2012, two with significant loss of life. U.S. government employees are advised not to use inter-island ferry boat services unless they are the only means of transportation available. There have also been a series of bus accidents due to poor bus maintenance or driver error. While taxis are the recommended form of public transportation, there have been safety issues using taxis. Please refer to our Safety and Security section for more information.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of the Philippine’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of the Philippine’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page.](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa)

**Maritime Travel:** Mariners planning travel to the Philippines should also check for U.S. maritime [advisories](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories) and [alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts). Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard homeport website](https://homeport.uscg.mil/) and the [NGA broadcast warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings).
