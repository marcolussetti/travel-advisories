# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:** Terrorist groups, and those inspired by such organizations, are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less-sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to target crowds more effectively. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

U.S. citizens should remain alert to the potential for explosions and bombings as part of pre-planned attacks, as well as the threat of kidnapping.

Terrorist and armed groups continue plotting possible kidnappings, bombings, and other attacks in the Philippines. Terrorist and armed groups may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, markets/shopping malls, and local government facilities.

**Crime:** Confidence games (con games), pickpocketing, internet scams, and credit/ATM card fraud are common. Be wary of unknown individuals who attempt to befriend you, especially just after you arrive in country. Do not accept food, drinks, or rides in private vehicles from strangers, even if they appear to be legitimate. Solo travelers have been drugged and robbed by strangers after accepting an invitation to visit a tourist destination.

Kidnappings, physical assaults, murder-for-hire, and other violent crimes occur in the Philippines.

Travelers have been stopped and robbed shortly after leaving Manila Ninoy Aquino International Airport in a taxi or private vehicle.

Taxi drivers and/or individuals using stolen taxi cabs have committed robberies. Ask the hotel, restaurant, and/or business establishment to call a reliable taxi service for you or use a ride-sharing application.

Other tips for safer travel by taxi:

* Do not enter a taxi if it is already occupied by another passenger.
* Request that the taxi driver use the meter to record your fare.
* Wait for another cab if the driver is unwilling to comply with these requests.
* Make a mental note of the license plate number of your taxi, or text it to someone, should there be a problem.

When driving in the city, make certain that vehicle doors are locked and windows are rolled up.

One common form of credit/ATM card fraud involves an illicit electronic device attached to ATM card readers that retrieves and records information, including the PIN, from a card's magnetic strip. Refer to the Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC) website for more [information](https://www.osac.gov/Pages/ContentReportDetails.aspx?cid=20279).

**International Financial Scams:**See the [Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/scams-and-safety/common-frauds-and-scams) pages for information on scams.

Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in the Philippines. Scams are often initiated through social media or by unsolicited emails or messages sent via messaging apps such as WhatsApp or Viber. Scammers may pose as potential romantic partners or as U.S. citizens in crisis.

Common scams include:

* Romance/online dating
* Money transfers
* Lucrative sales schemes
* Gold purchase schemes
* Contracts or jobs with promises of large salaries or commissions
* Grandparent/relative targeting
* Offers of free travel or luggage
* Lottery winnings

**Tourism:** Please check with the [Philippine Department of Tourism](https://beta.tourism.gov.ph/) before traveling. The safety standards you might expect of transport and tour operators, including adventure activities such as SCUBA diving, are not always met. Operators may not provide sufficient safety equipment or observe recommended maintenance standards and safety precautions. Always use available safety equipment, such as lifejackets or seatbelts, even if others do not. If appropriate safety equipment is not available, use another provider. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country. However, outside of major metropolitan centers, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html). If you are planning to SCUBA dive, the [Diver’s Alert Network (DAN)](https://dan.org/) provides information on diving accident management.
