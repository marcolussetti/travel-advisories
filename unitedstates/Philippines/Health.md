For emergency services in the Philippines, dial 911.

Ambulance services are not widely available, and training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards. Most ambulances are not equipped medical equipment and function as medical transport only.

**Healthcare Coverage and Medical Insurance:**   
Make sure your health insurance covers you while traveling overseas.  U.S. Medicare and Medicaid benefits cannot be used in the Philippines. While some private hospitals in the Philippines may accept international health insurance, most require you to pay up front and seek reimbursement from your insurance provider. Many providers in the Philippines only accept cash payments.

Check [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance when traveling abroad. You can also visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/before-travel) for advice on health insurance for travel.

For information about TRICARE (a health care program for service members, retirees, and their families), including possible vaccinations, please visit the [TRICARE overseas website](https://tricare.mil/Plans/HealthPlans).

**Supplemental Insurance:** We strongly recommend purchasing supplemental insurance that includes coverage for  medical evacuation while in the Philippines.  This type of insurance can help cover costly emergencies, including air transportation to the nearest medical facility or back to the United States if needed.

Blood types that are Rh-negative (e.g., O-negative, A-negative, B-negative, AB-negative) are extremely rare in the Philippines, as they occur in less than one percent of the population.  U.S. citizens with Rh-negative blood are encouraged to be aware of this scarcity, particularly in the event of an emergency requiring a transfusion.  Travelers with known medical conditions may wish to identify hospitals or donor networks that can accommodate their needs before traveling.

Vaccinations: Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/index.html) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Veterans Affairs (VA) Clinic in Manila:** The VA Manila Outpatient Clinic provides services to eligible U.S. veterans living in the Philippines.  It offers outpatient medical care and assistance with service-connected disabilities only.  Care that is not service-connected is not permitted and will have to be obtained in the community at the veteran’s expense.  The clinic cannot provide inpatient care.  For more details on eligibility and available services, visit the [VA Manila](https://www.va.gov/manila-va-clinic/) website or contact the clinic directly.

The U.S. Embassy maintains a [list of doctors and hospitals](https://ph.usembassy.gov/hospitals-and-medical-facilities-in-the-philippines/?_ga=2.27269948.1618084337.1685063387-685343346.1685063386) in the Philippines that accept U.S. patients. We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.

Health facilities in general:

* Adequate health facilities are available throughout the country but health care in rural areas may be below U.S. standards.  Medical staff may speak little or no English.
* Public medical clinics lack basic resources and supplies.  Staff may be limited, particularly overnight.  Consider hiring a private nurse or having family spend the night with the patient, especially a minor child.
* Hospitals and doctors often require payment or proof of adequate insurance prior to service or admission.
* Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals.
* Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based psychological and psychiatric care only available through government institutions.
* Some medical facilities engage in unethical business practices, pricing, and collection measures. Travelers should make efforts to obtain complete information on billing, pricing, and proposed medical procedures before agreeing to any medical care.
* Be aware that some hotels or resorts may have exclusive agreements with medical providers, which may limit your choices in seeking emergency medical attention.

**Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery:** Medical tourism is a rapidly growing industry. People seeking health care overseas should understand that medical systems operate differently from those in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations. Anyone interested in traveling for medical purposes should consult with their local physician before traveling and visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/medical-tourism) website for more information on medical tourism.

* U.S. citizens have suffered serious complications or died during or after having cosmetic or other elective surgery in the Philippines.
* We strongly recommend those considering obtaining such care in the Philippines  purchase [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications.
* Your legal options in case of malpractice are very limited in the Philippines.
* Although the Philippines has some cosmetic surgery facilities that are on par with those found in the United States, the quality of care varies widely. If you plan to undergo surgery in the Philippines, make sure that emergency medical facilities are available and professionals are accredited and qualified.

**Pharmaceuticals:**

* Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, including those that require a prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with few controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments.
* U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication to the United States. Do not attempt to bring medication purchased abroad into the United States without confirming it complies with their requirements. Please visit the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/) websites for more information.
