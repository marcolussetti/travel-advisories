# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities prior to practicing or operating a business.

The judicial process in the Philippines can be lengthy, with cases often taking several years to reach resolution. Individuals facing criminal charges may encounter extended periods of pre-trial detention.

Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking illegal drugs are strictly enforced, including significant prison terms, substantial fines, and in severe cases, life imprisonment. Carry prescription medication in its original packaging and check with the Philippine Bureau of Customs to ensure it is legal in the Philippines.

Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs could land you immediately in jail.

Travelers should know that medical marijuana is illegal in the Philippines, even with a prescription from the United States or elsewhere. Bringing marijuana or cannabis-based products into the Philippines can result in drug trafficking charges, a non-bailable offense with a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.  The Department strongly advises travelers not to bring marijuana or any cannabis-based products, including vape cartridges, into the Philippines under any circumstances.

Always carry a copy of your passport in the event that you are asked about your citizenship. You may be questioned by authorities if you take pictures of certain buildings, especially government buildings or military installations.

The Philippine Bureau of Immigration (BI) may consider the participation of foreign nationals in demonstrations or political rallies in the Philippines to be anti-government and/or a violation of the terms of admission, resulting in possible detention or deportation

In the Philippines, any adult in the company of a minor under 12 years old who is not related within the “fourth degree” may be subject to a severe penalty.

U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents who have sex with people under the age of 18 or commit other sexual offenses involving children overseas are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of whether those offenses are illegal under local law. See our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Counterfeit and pirated goods are illegal in the Philippines. You may  pay fines or have counterfeit goods seized if you attempt to bring them back to the United States. See the [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-ccips) for more information.

**LGB Travelers:** There is no prohibition on entry into the Philippines by LGB individuals. Same-sex relationships are not illegal in the Philippines but they lack legal recognition. No federal law prohibits discrimination against LGB individuals. Several cities, however, have passed local ordinances protecting LGB rights. Despite these legislative efforts, LGB individuals continue to face discrimination and harassment.

See our [LGB Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgb.html) Page and section  of our [Human Rights Report](https://www.state.gov/reports-bureau-of-democracy-human-rights-and-labor/country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** Streets, buildings, and public transportation may lack facilities for persons with disabilities. Most public buildings are inaccessible to persons with mobility impairments.  Government efforts to improve access to transportation for persons with disabilities are limited due to weak implementing regulations.

There are local stores in the Philippines that sell durable medical equipment . Some pharmacies also carry limited medical supplies and equipment.
