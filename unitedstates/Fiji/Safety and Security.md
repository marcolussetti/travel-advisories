# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Public Safety:**Although demonstrations are not common in Fiji, you should avoid marches and large crowds, remembering that even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent unexpectedly.

**Crime:**Remain cautious and alert in public places. Urban areas experience a higher incidence of crime than rural areas, but there are specific locations to avoid.  Most crime is opportunistic. If you are not familiar with an area, ask hotel staff about areas to avoid.

* Several assaults and robberies have occurred in the bar and nightclub district of downtown Suva, the waterfront/seawall area during hours of darkness, as well as on Victoria Parade Street. Consider taking door-to-door transportation.
* Violent robberies and assaults continue to occur within the Colo I Suva Forest Park and as of July 2023 there is no security presence on the trails.
* Be attentive to your personal safety and be cautious about sharing too much personal information about where you are from and where you are staying while traveling.
* Reports of sexual assault against female tourists have increased. You should not walk alone after dark and always be sure to avoid isolated and deserted areas.
* Since some crime takes place in taxis, do not allow taxis to pick up other passengers while you are enroute. Similarly, you should never enter a taxi already carrying other passengers.

**Victims of Crime:** U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance at + (679) 331-4466, or after hours at +(679) 772-8049.

**Tourism:**The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage.
