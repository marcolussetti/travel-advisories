# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Fiji.html#ExternalPopup) website.

**Arrest Notification:**If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://fj.usembassy.gov/arrest-of-a-u-s-citizen/) for further information.

**Disaster preparedness:**

* Fiji is located in an area of high seismic activity called the “Ring of Fire” and is subject to earthquakes which can trigger a tsunami.
* The rainy (or monsoon) season in the South Pacific is from November to April, when strong winds, heavy rains, landslides, and disruptions to services could occur.
* For information about tropical cyclone preparedness, visit our [disaster preparedness webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/crisis_and_disaster_abroad_be_ready.html) and [NOAA's Hurricane Preparedness Guide.](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Fiji.html#ExternalPopup)

**LGB Travelers:** The constitution of Fiji prohibits discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, and expression. Fijian law also prohibits discrimination in employment based on sexual orientation; however, there are no laws specifically prohibiting discrimination against LGB persons in other areas.

LGB travelers may encounter difficulties when pursuing adoption, marriage, devolution of property on death and pension, and holding public office.

Fijian law does not criminalize consensual same-sex sexual activity and recognizes male-on-male rape as a crime.

In general attitudes toward LGB individuals have become more accepting, especially among the young, and articles promoting tolerance are regularly found in the media.

Seeour [LGB Travel Information](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/lgbt.html)page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:**All persons are considered equal under Fijian law, and discrimination against persons with disabilities in employment, education, provision of housing and land, or provision of other state services is illegal. Statutes provide for the right of access to places and all modes of transport are open to the public. Public health regulations include penalties for noncompliance; however, there is little or no enforcement of laws protecting persons with disabilities.

Building regulations require new public buildings to be accessible to persons with disabilities, but only a few existing buildings meet this requirement. Under the Health and Safety at Work Act, all new office spaces must be accessible to persons with disabilities. The number of disabled-accessible vehicles in the country is small.

There are some special schools for persons with physical, cognitive, and sensory disabilities, but cost and location limit access. Opportunities for a secondary school education for those with disabilities are very limited.
