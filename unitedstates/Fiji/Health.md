**For emergency services in Fiji dial 911 or 910.**

Ambulance services are not widely available and training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards. Ambulances are often not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

**The Department of State does not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance coverage overseas. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Fiji.html#ExternalPopup) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

**Medication**: Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.

**Vaccinations:**Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Fiji.html#ExternalPopup) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Air Quality:**Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas. Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in [destination]. For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/). For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).

**Health facilities:**

* Health facilities are available in major cities, but health care in rural areas may be below U.S. standards.
* Public medical clinics sometimes lack basic resources and supplies.
* Hospitals and doctors often require payment “up front” prior to service or admission. Most hospitals and medical professionals require cash payment.
* Hospitals usually require advance payment or proof of adequate insurance before admitting a patient.
* Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions

**Pharmaceuticals:**

* Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with little controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments.
* U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Fiji.html#ExternalPopup) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Fiji.html#ExternalPopup) websites for more information.

**Adventure Travel:**

* Scuba divers should be aware that Fiji’s hyperbaric chamber is currently not in service, and the nearest chambers are in New Zealand and Australia.
* While Fiji continues work to bring a new chamber online, divers should consider insurance that covers both decompression treatment and, if needed, medical evacuation to a third country.
