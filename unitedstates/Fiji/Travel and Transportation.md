# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:**Traffic moves on the left in Fiji. While most roads in urban areas are paved, they are poorly maintained. Roads outside the city are usually not paved. In the city, be especially attentive when driving after dark. Outside of the city, it is best to avoid driving after dark except in emergency or exceptional circumstances. Insufficient lighting, stray animals, and potholes make driving dangerous and particularly hazardous at night.

**Traffic Laws:**Driving while intoxicated is illegal in Fiji. Use of a mobile phone while driving is illegal. Bicycle riders should be cautious as there is no separate lane for cyclists.

**Public Transportation:** Avoid using minivans and public buses for public transportation, due to safety concerns.There have been multiple recent reports of public buses catching fire or having severe accidents.

**Maritime Travel:** The U.S. Coast Guard has concerns about the security practices in the ports of Fiji.  Until those concerns can be addressed, the Coast Guard advises that Mariners and passengers traveling through the ports of Fiji should exercise caution.

Mariners planning travel to Fiji should check for U.S. maritime [advisories](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories) and [alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts).  Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard homeport](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings) website, and the [NGA broadcast warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings) website.
