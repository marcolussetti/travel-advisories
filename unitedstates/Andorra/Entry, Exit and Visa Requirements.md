# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

Visit [Andorra’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs](https://www.exteriors.ad/en/travel-to-andorra) website for the most current travel requirements information.

* We recommend passports be valid for at least six months beyond your stay.
* You may enter Andorra through Spain or France under the Schengen Visa Waiver Agreement for a stay of up to 90 days; however, long term visitors should follow the relevant residency regulations and obtain the required Andorra residence card (Note: Andorra does not issue visas).
* Upon re-entry to the Schengen zone, your passport should have at least 90 days validity after the date of your planned departure from the Schengen zone.
* If you require a Schengen visa to enter Europe, be sure your visa entitles you to multiple entries to safeguard against being refused re-entry to Spain or France following a stay in Andorra. For further details about travel into and within Schengen countries, please see our [website](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/US_Travelers_in_Europes_Schengen_Area.html).
* If you wish to stay in **Andorra longer than three months,** or to apply for residency, you must provide a criminal record check to Andorran authorities. This may be obtained from the [Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Criminal Justice Information Services office (CJIS)](https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/identity-history-summary-checks), which you would then send to the [Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/internl-judicial-asst/authentications-and-apostilles/apostille-requirements.html) to obtain the required apostille. You can download the FBI form for fingerprint collection (FD-258) directly from the FBI website link: [https://www.fbi.gov/form-fd-258-1.pdf](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/standard-fingerprint-form-fd-258-1.pdf/view). With this form you can visit the main police station of Andorra: Despatx Central de Policia, Ed. Administratiu de l'Obac, Crta. de l'Obac s/n, Escaldes-Engordany, Principat d'Andorra, Tel: +376-872000, e-mail: [policia@andorra.ad](mailto:policia@andorra.ad) and request that an officer take your fingerprints. This service is available from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. Monday through Friday but call ahead to confirm.
* To prevent international child abduction, many governments have initiated additional procedures at entry/exit points. These often include **requiring documentary evidence of relationship and permission for the child's travel** from the parent(s) or legal guardian not present. Having such documentation on hand, even if not required, may facilitate your entry/departure. (See: Unaccompanied minors travel information from Andorran authorities <https://www.exteriors.ad/en/travel-to-andorra>).

The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Andorra.
