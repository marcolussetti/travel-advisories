**Road Conditions and Safety:** While in Andorra, you may encounter road conditions that differ significantly from those in the United States.

Andorra’s transportation infrastructure is largely road-based. The road network has a length of 167 miles of which 123 are paved. In winter, the main roads are, in general, quickly cleared of snow and remain accessible but storms in the north might cause traffic disruptions.

See our [Road Safety page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/driving-and-road-safety.html) for more information. Visit the website of the Andorra Tourism authority and [Andorra’s national authority responsible for road safety](https://www.mobilitat.ad/).

**Traffic Laws:**

* You must carry proof of car insurance and an International Driving Permit while driving.
* **Driving while intoxicated is a very serious offense and carries heavy penalties.**
* **The use of front seatbelts is mandatory,** as are car seats for infants.
* **Talking on cell phones while driving is prohibited,**except when using a hands-free system.
* If your car is disabled due to an accident or mechanical issue, you will have to place two red warning triangles on the road, one in front and one behind the vehicle, to alert other drivers.
* Unlike in the United States, Andorran police authorities may levy and collect fines on the spot and issue a receipt for the payment.

**Public Transportation:** Bus service connects all parishes, and there is frequent long-distance bus service to La Seu d’Urgell and Barcelona in Spain and to Toulouse and Perpignan in France.

Car rental agencies in Andorra have offices in most towns. To rent a car, you must be in possession of a valid EU driver’s license or an International Driving Permit and a credit card.

Taxi service is available through the [Andorra Association of Interurban Taxi Drivers](https://visitandorra.com/places-and-services/association-of-interurban-taxi-drivers/).

The nearest airports in France are **Toulouse**, **Carcassonne** and Perpignan. Most offer coach or minibus service to Andorra.
