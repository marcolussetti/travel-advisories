Good medical care is available in Andorra. Regulations regarding medications may vary from those in the United States, however. Andorra relies on the Spanish and French postal systems. As Spanish and French regulations do not permit the international shipment of medication, please do not ship medication from the United States to Andorra as the package will transit through Spain or France and likely be intercepted. U.S. citizens who plan a lengthy trip to Andorra should bring their own medication or obtain a prescription for that medication from a local physician.

The U.S. Consulate General maintains [a list of doctors and hospitals](https://es.usembassy.gov/medical-assistance/#medicalserviceslist). We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.

For emergency services in Andorra dial **112**.

Ambulance services are widely available.

**The U.S. government does not pay medical bills for private U.S. citizens.**Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance**

Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance coverage overseas. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the [Andorra’s Health Department](https://www.salut.ad/contacta-ns) to ensure the medication is legal in Andorra.

**Vaccinations**

Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Health facilities in general**

* Adequate health facilities are available in Andorra La Vella but health care in rural areas may be below U.S. standards.
* Hospitals usually require advance payment or proof of adequate insurance before admitting a patient.
* Medical staff may speak little or no English.

**Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery**

* Medical tourism is a rapidly growing industry. People seeking health care overseas should understand that medical systems operate differently from those in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations. Anyone interested in traveling for medical purposes should consult with their local physician before traveling and visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/medical-tourism) website for more information on Medical Tourism.
* We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications.

**Pharmaceuticals**

* Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, may be readily available for purchase with little controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments.
* U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/buyingusingmedicinesafely/buyingmedicinefromoutsidetheunitedstates/default.htm) websites for more information.

**Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy**

* If you are considering traveling to Andorra to have a child through use of assisted reproductive technology (ART), please see our [ART and Surrogacy Abroad page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Assisted-Reproductive-Technology-ART-Surrogacy-Abroad.html).
* Surrogacy is illegal in Andorra and subject to complex local regulation.
