# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:** Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on conducting attacks worldwide, including within Europe. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

For more information, see our [Terrorism](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html) page.

**Crime:** Andorra has a low crime rate. However, since all visitors to Andorra transit through southern France or northeast Spain, it is important to be aware of the type of crime that tourists typically experience in the region. Please refer to country information for [Spain](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Spain.html) and [France](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/France.html) for additional details.

* **The local equivalent to the “911” emergency line for police, ambulance, or fire in Andorra is 112.** Typically, the 112 line has English-speaking operators.

**International Financial Scams:** See the [Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud)  pages for information.

**Victims of Crime:** Report crimes to the local police at 110 and contact the U.S. Consulate General in Barcelona at + (34) 932-802-227 for assistance. U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Consulate General. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is generally regulated and rules [with regards to best practices and safety inspections] are regularly enforced. Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).
