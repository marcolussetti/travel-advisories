# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

* Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Andorra are severe. You can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.
* Driving under the influence could land you immediately in jail.
* Your U.S. passport won’t help you avoid arrest or prosecution.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Consulate General immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ccips) for more information.

**Faith-Based Travelers:** See the following webpages for details:

**LGB Travelers:** There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Andorra. The LGB community in Andorra is not as visible or as politically organized as in neighboring countries. Andorran law prohibits discrimination against LGB persons.

* Andorra allows for civil unions for same-sex couples. According to Andorran law 34/2014, the same sex “civil union” is accorded all of the same benefits as a “marriage” and differs in name only.
* Andorra recognizes same-sex marriages performed in other countries where it is legal if neither spouse is an Andorran citizen. If one or both spouses are Andorran, the same sex marriage performed elsewhere would be recorded in Andorra’s Civil Registry as a “civil union.”

**Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:** Andorran law prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, and mental disabilities in employment, education, access to health care, and the provision of other state services.

* Persons with disabilities have easy access to public buildings.
* Andorra ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in March 2014, and the government continues to adapt infrastructure to the needs of disabled persons to ensure accessibility to public transportation, museums, commerce, restaurants, and other buildings throughout the country.
* Taxis that can accommodate wheelchairs are available but must be called in advance.
* In some areas, sidewalks can be narrow and very steep. You should take this into account when planning your visit.
