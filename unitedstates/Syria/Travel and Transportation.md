# Travel and Transportation

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Exercise caution if driving in Syria because road conditions are hazardous and there are threats generated by active conflict.

Visitors may encounter hostile activity, harassment, or even abduction at both official and unofficial security checkpoints on roads throughout the country. Although drivers generally follow traffic signs and signals in urban centers, they maneuver aggressively and show little regard for vehicles traveling near them. Lane markings are usually ignored. Unlike in the United States, vehicles within Syrian traffic circles must give way to entering traffic. At night, it is very difficult to see pedestrians, who often walk into traffic with little warning. Outside major cities, it is common to find pedestrians, animals, and vehicles on unlit roads at night.

Pedestrians should exercise caution. Parked cars, deteriorating pavement, and guard posts obstruct sidewalks, often forcing pedestrians to walk in the street. Vehicles often do not stop for pedestrians and regularly run red lights or “jump” the green light well before it changes. Drivers and passengers are subject to demands for money, harassment, and abduction throughout the country. Rule of law, including traffic laws, and law enforcement is absent in many areas of the country.

See our [Road Safety page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/driving-and-road-safety.html) for more information.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** Because of the risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Syria, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) that prohibits U.S. flights from flying within Syrian airspace and advises caution for flights operating within 200 nautical miles.

For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the [Federal Aviation Administration's Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/).

As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Syria, the FAA has not assessed the government of Syria’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa).

**Maritime Travel:** Mariners planning travel to Syria should also check for U.S. maritime [advisories](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories) and [alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts). Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard homeport](https://homeport.uscg.mil/) website, and the [NGA broadcast warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings) .

The Commandant of the Coast Guard has determined that effective anti-terrorism measures are not in place in Syrian ports. Therefore, the Commandant has imposed conditions of entry on vessels that arrive in U.S. ports, after visiting Syrian ports. Mariners and passengers on commercial vessels traveling through the ports of Syria should exercise increased caution.
