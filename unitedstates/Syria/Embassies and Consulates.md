# Embassies and Consulates

[#### Embassies and Consulates](javascript:void(0); "Embassies and Consulates")

The U.S. Department of State urges U.S. citizens not to travel to Syria. More information can be found in the U.S. Department of State’s [Syria Travel Advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/syria-travel-advisory.html). The [U.S. Embassy in Damascus](https://sy.usembassy.gov/) suspended operations in 2012, and therefore for over a decade has not been able to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens who choose to travel to Syria despite the Travel Advisory.

Czechia, acting through its Embassy in Damascus, serves as the Protecting Power for U.S. interests in Syria. The range of consular services Czechia provides to U.S. citizens is extremely limited. U.S. citizens in Syria who seek consular services should contact the U.S. Interests Section of the Embassy of Czechia in Damascus at damascus.usis@mzv.gov.cz.

U.S. citizens in Syria who are in need of emergency assistance but are unable to reach the U.S. Interests Section of the Embassy of the Czechia, should contact the U.S. Embassy in Amman, Jordan:   
   
Telephone: +962 (6) 590-6950    
Emergencies: +962 (6) 590-6500   
E-mail: [Amman-ACS@state.gov](mailto:Amman-ACS@state.gov)

U.S. citizens may also call 1-888-407-4747 (from the U.S.) or +1 202-501-4444 (from overseas) for assistance.
