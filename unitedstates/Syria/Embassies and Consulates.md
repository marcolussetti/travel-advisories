# Embassies and Consulates

[#### Embassies and Consulates](javascript:void(0); "Embassies and Consulates")

The U.S. Department of State strongly recommends that U.S. citizens not travel to Syria. More information can be found in the U.S. Department of Stateâ€™s [Syria Travel Advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/syria-travel-advisory.html). The [U.S. Embassy in Damascus](https://sy.usembassy.gov/) suspended operations in 2012, and therefore cannot provide emergency or routine consular services to U.S. citizens who choose to travel to Syria despite the Travel Advisory.

The Czech Republic, acting through its Embassy in Damascus, serves as the Protecting Power for U.S. interests in Syria. The range of consular services the Czech Republic provides to U.S. citizens is extremely limited. U.S. citizens in Syria who seek consular services should contact the U.S. Interests Section of the Embassy of the Czech Republic in Damascus at [USIS\_damascus@embassy.mzv.cz](mailto:USIS_damascus@embassy.mzv.cz).

U.S. citizens in Syria who are in need of emergency assistance but are unable to reach the U.S. Interests Section of the Embassy of the Czech Republic, should contact the U.S. Embassy in Amman, Jordan:  
  
Telephone: +962 (6) 590-6950   
Emergencies: +962 (6) 590-6500  
E-mail: [Amman-ACS@state.gov](mailto:Amman-ACS@state.gov)

U.S. citizens may also call 1-888-407-4747 (from the U.S.) or +1 202-501-4444 (from overseas) for assistance.
