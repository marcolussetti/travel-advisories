***Updated to reflect recent developments in Syria.***

Do not travel to Syria due to the risk of **terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, hostage taking, and armed conflict**.

**Country Summary:** The U.S. government suspended operations of the U.S. Embassy in 2012. Czechia serves as the protecting power for the United States in Syria. The U.S. government is unable to provide any routine or emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in Syria. **Do not travel to Syria for any reason.**

Syria has experienced active armed conflict since 2011. No part of Syria is safe from violence. Hostage taking by armed groups, terrorism, remnants of war such as unexploded ordnance, and aerial bombardment pose significant risk of death or serious injury. The destruction of infrastructure, housing, medical facilities, schools, and power and water utilities has also increased hardships inside the country.

The U.S. government strongly warns private U.S. citizens against traveling to Syria to engage in armed conflict. The U.S. government does not support this activity. U.S. citizens who undertake such activity face extreme personal risks, including hostage taking by armed groups, injury, or death.

 There is risk of terrorist violence, including terrorist attacks and other activity in Syria. Visit the U.S. Department of State’s [country reports on terrorism](https://www.state.gov/country-reports-on-terrorism/) to learn more. Parts of Syria have experienced recent increases in incidents of bombings, improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and assassinations. Providing material support or resources to designated foreign terrorist organizations, including ISIS and al-Qa’ida (AQ) affiliates, is a **crime under U.S. law** that can result in penalties including prison time and large fines.

There is an ongoing risk of hostage taking of U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals throughout the country. In the past, U.S. citizens have been targets of abduction and detention in Syria. Those in detention may not have access to fair judicial process or medical attention. Current detention center conditions are unclear but could be harsh and unsanitary. Failure to obtain a legitimate entry visa directly from the Syrian government could result in detention.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) advising against travel to Syria due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Syria. For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the [Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/). Read the [country information page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/SyrianArabRepublic.html) for additional information on Syria, including alerts related to the closure of airspace.

**If despite this warning, you decide to travel to Syria:**

* Visit our website on [Travel to High Risk Areas](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/high-risk-travelers.html).
* Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries or power of attorney.
* Familiarize yourself with and respect local laws and customs. Foreign travelers may face increased risk of detention and harassment.
* Establish a proof of life protocol with your loved ones. This is so that if you are taken hostage, your loved ones know specific questions (and answers) to ask the hostage-takers to be sure that you are alive (and to rule out a hoax).
* Leave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your loved ones to access them.
* Share important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones. This is so they can manage your affairs if you are unable to return as planned to the United States. Review thoroughly this [list](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-checklist.html) of documents to prepare for your trip.
* Check local media for breaking events. Be prepared to adjust your plans.
* Develop a communication plan with family or your employer or host organization (if you are traveling on business). This is so they can monitor your safety and location as you travel through high-risk areas. Specify how you will confirm you’re safe (texts, calls, etc.), how often, and whom you will contact first to share the information.
* Avoid demonstrations and crowds.
* Keep travel documents up to date and easily accessible.
* Have evacuation plans that do not rely on U.S. government assistance.
* Make backup plans to leave the country.
* Enroll in [Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)](https://step.state.gov/step/) to receive messages and Alerts.
* Prepare a plan for emergency situations. Review the [Traveler’s Checklist](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-checklist.html).
* Visit the CDC page for the [latest Travel Health Information](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list) related to your travel and return to the United States.

We highly recommend that you buy insurance before you travel. Check with your [travel insurance provider](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) about evacuation assistance, medical insurance, and trip cancellation coverage.
