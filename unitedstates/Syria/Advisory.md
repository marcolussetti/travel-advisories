***Updated to reflect the risk of unjust detention and updates to the Syrian conflict.***

Do not travel to Syria due to the risk of **terrorism**, **civil unrest, kidnapping, hostage taking, armed conflict, and unjust detention.**

**Country Summary:** The U.S. government suspended operations in 2012.  The Czech Republic serves as the protecting power for the United States in Syria.  The U.S. government is unable to provide any routine or emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in Syria.  Do not travel to Syria for any reason.

On December 8, 2024, the Assad regime fell, and Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) assumed control over much of Syria.  Syria has experienced active armed conflict since 2011.  No part of Syria is safe from violence.  Hostage taking by armed groups, unjust detentions, the use of chemical warfare, shelling, mine fields, and aerial bombardment of civilian centers pose significant risk of death or serious injury.  The destruction of infrastructure, housing, medical facilities, schools, and power and water utilities has also increased hardships inside the country.  The interim entities in Syria currently cannot provide even the most routine public services.

The U.S. government strongly warns private U.S. citizens against traveling to Syria to engage in armed conflict.  The U.S. government does not support this activity.  U.S. citizens who undertake such activity face extreme personal risks, including hostage taking by armed groups, unjust detentions, injury, or death.

Terrorist groups are active in Syria.  Parts of Syria have experienced recent increases in incidents of bombings, IEDs, and assassinations.  Fighting on behalf of or providing other forms of support to designated terrorist organizations, including ISIS and al-Qa’ida (AQ) affiliates, can constitute the provision of material support for terrorism or a foreign terrorist organization, which is a crime under U.S. law that can result in penalties including prison time and large fines.  The United States continues to designate Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) as a terrorist group.

There is an ongoing risk of hostage taking of U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals throughout the country.  U.S. citizens continue to be targets of abduction and unjust detention by interim entities and other armed groups.  Those in detention may not have access to fair judicial process or medical attention.  Former Assad regime detention centers were known to be unsanitary facilities where widespread cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment of detainees had been documented, as well as torture and extrajudicial killings.  Detention center conditions under interim entities are unclear but could be harsh and unsanitary.  Only Syrian diplomatic missions abroad can issue a valid entry visa to Syria.  Failure to obtain a legitimate entry visa directly from the Syrian diplomatic missions could result in detention.

Due to risks of operating civilian aircraft within or in the vicinity of Syria, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR).  For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the [Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/).

If you decide to travel to Syria:

* Visit our website on [Travel to High Risk Areas](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/high-risk-travelers.html).
* Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney.
* Familiarize yourself with and respect local laws and customs.  Foreign travelers may face increased risk of detention and harassment.
* Establish a proof of life protocol with your family, so that if you are taken hostage, your family knows specific questions (and answers) to ask the hostage-takers to be sure that you are alive and to rule out a hoax.
* Leave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them.
* Share important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones.  This is so they can manage your affairs if you are unable to return as planned to the United States.  Review thoroughly this [list](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-checklist.html) of documents to prepare for your trip.
* Check local media for breaking events. Be prepared to adjust your plans.
* Develop a communication plan with family and/or your employer or host organization so that they can monitor your safety and location as you travel through high-risk areas. This plan should specify who you would contact first, and how they should share the information.
* Enroll your trip in the State Department's [Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)](https://step.state.gov/step/) to receive Alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.
* Prepare a contingency plan for emergency situations.  Review the [Traveler’s Checklist](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-checklist.html).
* Visit the CDC page for the latest [Travel Health Information](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list) related to your travel.
* We highly recommend that you buy insurance before you travel. Check with your [travel insurance provider](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) about evacuation assistance, medical insurance, and trip cancellation coverage.
