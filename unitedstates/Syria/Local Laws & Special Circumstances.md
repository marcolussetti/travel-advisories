# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you break local laws, even if you don’t know it, you can be expelled from the area, arrested, or put in prison. If you want to start a business or work in a job that needs special permits or licenses, you should get information from the local authorities before you start.

Syria imposes more severe penalties for certain crimes than the United States. For example, Article 39 of Syria’s Narcotics Act imposes the death penalty for drug trafficking or cultivation.

Women who are arrested under suspicion of immoral behavior (e.g., being alone in a room with a man who is not the woman’s husband or being in a residence where drugs or alcohol are being consumed) may be subjected to a virginity test.

Loitering or taking photographs of anything that could be perceived as being of military or security interest may result in questioning, confiscation of the images, or detention by security services.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Interests section immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information on consular notification and access.

**Military Service:** U.S.-Syrian and U.S.-Palestinian men who have never served in the Syrian military and who are planning to visit Syria despite the U.S. Department of State’s [Syria Travel Advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/syria-travel-advisory.html) should contact Syrian diplomatic missions prior to traveling concerning compulsory military service. See the “Dual Nationals” section above.

**Special Circumstances:** The security situation in Syria remains fluid with an elevated risk of violent armed conflict. The destruction of infrastructure, housing, medical facilities, schools, and power and water utilities has increased hardships in Syria. Communications in Syria are difficult as phone and internet connections are unreliable.

**Customs Requirements:** Syrian customs authorities may enforce strict regulations concerning temporary import into or export from Syria of items such as weapons, narcotics, alcohol, tobacco, cheese, fruit, pharmaceuticals, modems, cosmetics, and some electrical appliances.

Please refer to our [Customs Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/customs-and-import.html) page for additional information.

**Banking and Commerce:**Foreign currencies can be exchanged for Syrian pounds only by licensed money changers, the Commercial Bank of Syria (CBS), the Real Estate Bank, and at private banks, some of which maintain offices inside four- and five-star hotels.

Four and five-star hotels and high-end stores in Syria generally accept credit cards, although most restaurants, stores and shops operate exclusively in cash.

Foreigners visiting Syria are required to pay hotel bills in U.S. dollars, Euros, or other non-Syrian hard currency.

Traveler’s checks are not accepted in Syria and banks will not cash them unless the traveler has an account at the bank in question.

There are no U.S.-based banks operating in Syria.

There are 14 private banks operating in Syria, with branches and ATMs in most major cities. These ATMs usually honor major debit/credit systems.

Funds may be transferred into Syria through Western Union.

Wiring of funds through private banks is possible only if the traveler already holds an account with the bank in Syria. Private citizens seeking to transfer funds outside of Syria or to withdraw U.S. dollars from a bank in Syria should check with the relevant financial institution for the most up-to-date regulations.

**Trade and Sanctions:** Please consult the [Department of Treasury](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/pages/syria.aspx) and [Department of Commerce](https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/policy-guidance/country-guidance/sanctioned-destinations/syria) websites for more details.

Requests for specific licenses to authorize transactions that are neither exempt nor covered by a general license may be submitted to the Department of the Treasury’s [Office of Foreign Assets Control](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Pages/licensing.aspx) (OFAC).

You can review the [Department of Treasury’s Syria Sanctions](http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/pages/syria.as) page for more information.

Additionally, U.S. persons are prohibited from engaging in financial transactions which a U.S. person knows or has reasonable cause to believe pose a risk of furthering terrorist acts in the United States. For additional information about Terrorism List Government Sanctions Regulations, consult the terrorism brochure on the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s [OFAC home page](http://www.treas.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/) or via OFAC's info-by-fax service at (202) 622-0077.

**Gay and Lesbian Travelers:** Syrian law criminalizes consensual same-sex conduct under penal code article 520, which states that each sexual act "against the order of nature" is punishable by as long as three years imprisonment. LGB persons in Syria have been arrested on charges such as abusing social values; selling, buying, or consuming illegal drugs; or organizing and promoting “obscene” parties. LGB persons and persons perceived to be LGB have reportedly been murdered by non-state actors.

See our [LGB Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgb.html) page.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** The law in Syria prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities in education, access to health, or provision of other state services; however, the Assad regime did not enforce these provisions. Sidewalks are generally unevenly paved and often blocked by parked cars. Stairs must be used to access many public buildings, restaurants, cafes, and other tourist spots.
