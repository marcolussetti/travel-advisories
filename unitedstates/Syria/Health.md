For emergency services in Syria, dial 110 for ambulance and 113 for fire.

Ambulance services are not present throughout the country, except in the capital and provincial cities.

Basic medical care and medicines are available in Damascus and some coastal areas, but not necessarily in other areas. Serious illnesses and emergencies may require evacuation to a neighboring country or more developed medical facility. There are shortages of food, water, medicine, and medical supplies throughout Syria.

**The Department of State, U.S. embassies, and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our [Insurance Overseas page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) for more information on insurance providers with overseas coverage.
