Basic medical care and medicines are available in Damascus and some coastal areas, but not necessarily in other areas. Serious illnesses and emergencies may require evacuation to a neighboring country or more developed medical facility. There are shortages of food, water, medicine, and medical supplies throughout Syria.

For emergency services in Syria, dial 110 for ambulance and 113 for fire.

Ambulance services are not present throughout the country, except in the capital and provincial cities.

**The Department of State does not pay medical bills**

Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance**

Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our [Insurance Overseas page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) for more information on insurance providers with overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

* We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

**Vaccinations**

Be up to date on all [vaccinations](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
