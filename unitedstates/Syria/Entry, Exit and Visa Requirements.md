# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

Before traveling to Syria, please read the current [Travel Advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/syria-travel-advisory.html).

The Travel Advisory for Syria is Level 4, Do Not Travel. The Department of State recommends U.S. citizens do not travel to Syria due to the risk of terrorism, civil unrest, hostage taking, and armed conflict. Exercise increased caution due to the risk of unjust detention.

A passport and a visa are required to enter Syria. Visas must be obtained prior to arrival in Syria from a Syrian diplomatic mission located in the traveler’s country of residence.  The Embassy of the Syrian Arab Republic in Washington, D.C., suspended all operations, including consular services, on March 18, 2014, and Syria does not have a protecting power currently providing consular services on its behalf in the United States.

Foreigners who wish to stay 15 days or more in Syria must register with Syrian immigration authorities by the 15th day of their stay.

A departure tax at Syrian land and sea borders is collected for all individuals departing the country except those on diplomatic passports and children under the age of 11.

Syria usually will not issue visas or residency permits to students wishing to study religion or Arabic in private religious institutions.

According to Syrian law, only Syrian diplomatic missions can issue a valid entry visa to Syria.  Failure to obtain a legitimate entry visa directly from a Syrian diplomatic mission could result in detention.

**Israel Travel:** There are enforced restrictions on prior travel to Israel. Syria does not allow persons with passports bearing Israeli visas or entry/exit stamps to enter the country.  Overland entry into Syria directly from Israel is not permitted.  U.S. citizen travelers suspected of having traveled to Israel have been detained for questioning.

**Dual Nationality:** U.S. citizen males over the age of 18 holding dual Syrian citizenship, or non-dual U.S. citizen males of Syrian origin, even those born in the United States, may be subject to compulsory military service unless they receive a temporary or permanent exemption from a Syrian diplomatic mission abroad prior to their entry into Syria.

According to Syrian law, a child under the age of 18 whose father is Syrian or is of Syrian descent must have his/her father’s permission to leave Syria, even if the parents are separated or divorced and the mother has been granted full custody by a Syrian court.  On occasion, the families of U.S.-Syrian dual-national women visiting Syria have attempted to prevent them from leaving the country, generally to compel the woman to marry.  Although under Syrian law a woman wishing to depart Syria does not need her husband's explicit consent in every instance, a Syrian husband may take legal action to prevent his wife from leaving the country, regardless of her nationality.  Once such legal orders are in place, the woman may not be able to depart Syria.

Some HIV/AIDS entry restrictions exist for visitors or foreign residents of Syria. HIV/AIDS tests are mandatory for foreigners from ages 15 to 60 who wish to reside in Syria. The HIV and AIDS test must be conducted in Syria at a facility approved by the Syrian Ministry of Health. A residence permit will not be issued until the applicant is determined HIV negative. Foreigners wishing to marry Syrian nationals in Syria must also be tested for HIV.  Please verify this information with the Syrian government before you travel.
