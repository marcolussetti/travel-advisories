# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

The Department of State continues to warn U.S. citizens against travel to Syria. Over the last 14 years, the Assad regime committed a range of atrocities, some of which constituted war crimes and crimes against humanity. While thousands of former regime and militia members have surrendered weapons and reconciled, some elements or supporters of the former Assad regime remain active in the country and continue fighting with HTS. Deadly clashes between elements of the Syrian National Army (SNA) and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in the north continue. Turkish and Israeli airstrikes impacting civilians also continue. Attacks from armed groups could happen with little or no warning. No part of Syria should be considered immune from violence, and the potential risk exists throughout the country for unpredictable and hostile acts, including kidnappings, sniper assaults, terrorist attacks, small arms fire, improvised explosives, artillery shelling, airstrikes, the use of chemical weapons, large and small-scale bombings, as well as, unjust detention, torture, sexual violence, and extrajudicial killings.

**Terrorism:** Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

Syria has been designated as a State Sponsor of Terrorism since 1979 and has given support to a variety of terrorist groups, affecting the stability of the region. Much of Syria, including Damascus, is controlled by or under the influence of designated terrorist groups. Syria is also home to several groups hostile to the United States. Terrorists often do not distinguish between U.S. government personnel and private U.S. citizens. Terrorists may target areas frequented by tourists, such as tourist sites, hotels, restaurants, and other frequently visited areas. U.S. citizens who choose to remain despite this warning should maintain a high level of vigilance and be aware of their surroundings. It is especially important for travelers to be unpredictable in their movements by varying times and routes and maintaining a low profile.

Elements within HTS as well as other non-state actor groups maintain anti-U.S. sentiment, which may intensify following significant events in the region, particularly those related to U.S.-Syria relations, international intervention in the ongoing conflict, Israeli-Palestinian issues, the status of Jerusalem, and clashes in Lebanon. The combination of terrorist organizations, a porous border with Iraq, and long-standing border issues with all its neighbors (Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, Türkiye, and Israel) have made Syria a destabilizing factor in the region and a potential target for reprisal.

**Crime:** Since the suspension of operations of the U.S. Embassy in Damascus in February of 2012, the U.S. government has not been able to provide accurate information about crime involving U.S. citizens visiting or living in Syria.

**Demonstrations**occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Demonstrations have turned violent.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**Scams:** Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Syria.

**Review** the [Department of State’s Protecting Yourself from Scams](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/scams-and-safety/common-frauds-and-scams) pages for more information.

**Victims of Crime:** If you or someone you know becomes the victim of a crime abroad, you should contact the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate. Czechia, through the U.S. Interests Section of the Czech Embassy in Damascus, currently serves as the Protecting Power for U.S. interests in Syria; however, their ability to provide services is extremely limited.

See our webpage on [help for U.S. victims of crime overseas](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/crime.html).

The U.S. Interests Section, in coordination with nearby U.S. embassies and consulates, may be able to:

* Help you find appropriate medical care
* Assist you in reporting a crime to the police
* Contact relatives or friends with your written consent
* Provide general information regarding the victim’s role during the local investigation and following its conclusion
* Provide information on [victim’s compensation programs in the U.S.](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/crime.html)
* Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution
* Help you find accommodation and arrange flights home
* Replace a stolen or lost passport

The local equivalents to the “911” emergency line in Syria is 110 for ambulance, 113 for fire, and 112 for the police. Syrian operators usually do not speak English. Any contact with Syrian security services has the potential to result in unjust detention.

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the U.S. Interests Section of the Czech Embassy in Damascus or U.S. Embassy Amman for assistance.

**Tourism:** No formal tourism industry infrastructure is in place on any level. Tourists are considered to be participating in activities at their own risk. Emergency response and subsequent appropriate medical treatment are not available in Syria. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.

**Syrian Conflict:** Sources estimate that the Syrian conflict has resulted in over 500,000 deaths with hundreds of thousands more wounded, arbitrarily detained, or forcibly disappeared since the conflict began in 2011. The Syrian conflict has resulted in over 5 million registered Syrian refugees, and millions more displaced inside Syria. More than 14 million people in Syria need humanitarian assistance.

Since September 2014, the U.S. government and others in the Defeat-ISIS Coalition have conducted military strikes on Syrian territory.

**Entities Operating in Syria:** HTS controls much of the country, but other armed groups exert control over northeast Syria and pockets of southern Syria.  Some armed groups have used car bombs, improvised explosive device/indirect-fire attacks, sniper fire, and carried out kidnappings throughout the country. Foreign combatants – including members of Iranian-aligned militia groups, Hizballah fighters, violent extremists, ISIS, and al-Qa'ida (AQ) elements – also participate in hostilities. Additionally, Türkiye engages in military operations in Syria, seeking to counter the influence of the Kurdistan Worker’s Party (PKK), a designated terrorist organization. These operations have reportedly resulted in deaths. Israel engages in military operations in Syria that have resulted in deaths and has extended its military position farther across the Golan Heights treaty line.

ISIS no longer controls territory in Syria but continues to operate as an insurgency throughout the country. ISIS continues to pose a significant threat to civilians residing in Syria and has demonstrated the ability to conduct coordinated attacks against armed actors and civilians. Tactics of ISIS and other violent extremist groups include the use of suicide bombers, kidnapping, small and heavy arms, improvised explosive devices, and chemical weapons. They have targeted major city centers, road checkpoints, border crossings, government buildings, energy infrastructure, shopping areas, and open spaces in Damascus, Aleppo, Hamah, Dara, Homs, Idlib, Deir Ezzor provinces and parts of northeast Syria. These groups have murdered, kidnapped or taken hostage U.S. citizens, both for ransom and political purposes; in some instances, U.S. citizens have disappeared within Syria. The U.S. government’s ability to help U.S. citizens kidnapped or taken hostage is very limited.

**Chemical Weapons:** In the past, the Assad regime repeatedly used chemical weapons, including the nerve agent sarin and chlorine gas, against civilians. ISIS has also conducted several sulfur mustard attacks in Syria. Although there has not been a documented chemical weapons attack in Syria since May 2019, the continuing violence, security situation, and ongoing concerns about Syria’s remaining chemical weapons capabilities contributes to a volatile situation.

**Kidnapping and Hostage Taking:** There is an ongoing, high risk of kidnapping or hostage taking of U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals throughout the country. U.S. citizens remain a specific target, with several high-profile abductions having occurred since mid-2012. U.S. citizen victims have had diverse professional backgrounds, including journalism and humanitarian work. U.S. citizens held captive by ISIS have been murdered by the group, which released videos of killings and publicly took responsibility for their deaths. U.S. citizens also have been abducted by other individuals and groups in Syria, and from various locations, including Damascus and Aleppo. Other U.S. citizens have gone missing and are believed to have been kidnapped or taken hostage.

**Detention Issues:** U.S. citizens are also targets of abduction and unjust detention by armed groups. The Assad regime implemented widespread use of detention and often tortured and/or forcibly disappeared detainees. Detention conditions under interim entities are unclear but could be under harsh and unsanitary conditions which can allow for the quick spread of various illnesses.

Please see our [Human Rights Report](https://www.state.gov/reports/2023-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/syria/) regarding these conditions.

**Borders:** A porous border with Iraq, and long-standing border issues with Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Türkiye, and Israel, have contributed to a complex security environment in Syria, compounded by a protracted violent conflict and influx of foreign fighters.

U.S. citizens should increase their vigilance if they travel within Syria to border areas with Iraq or Israel or the Al-Jazira (eastern Syria) region. The Government of Türkiye restricts crossings of its border with Syria and may change border crossing procedures without warning. Individuals seeking emergency medical treatment or safety from immediate danger are assessed on a case-by-case basis.

U.S. citizens have reported facing dangers traveling within the country and when trying to leave Syria via land borders, given the diminished availability of commercial air travel out of Syria. Border checkpoints should not be considered safe, as some armed groups have sought funding through kidnappings for ransom. Border areas are frequent targets of shelling and other attacks and are crowded because of internally displaced persons. Errant attacks will occasionally hit border towns just outside the borders as well.

**Engaging in Armed Conflict:** The U.S. government strongly warns U.S. citizens against traveling to Syria to engage in armed conflict. U.S. citizens who undertake such activity face extreme personal risks, including kidnapping, injury, or death. The U.S. government does not support this activity, and our ability to provide consular assistance to individuals who are arrested, injured, or kidnapped, or to the families of individuals who die in the conflict, is extremely limited.

Fighting on behalf of or knowingly providing other forms of material support or resources to designated terrorist organizations, including ISIS and HTS, is a crime under U.S. law that can result in penalties including prison time and large fines. Individuals who demonstrate an interest in groups opposing ISIS or other terrorist organizations, including on social media, may open themselves to being targeted by ISIS itself or others, especially if those individuals travel to Syria.

**Surveillance:** The Assad regime conducted intense physical and electronic surveillance of both Syrian citizens and foreign visitors on a domestic and global scale. Hotel rooms, internet connections, telephones, and fax machines were monitored, and personal possessions in hotel rooms could be searched. The regime reportedly planted spyware and other malware in Android applications to target human rights activists, opposition members, and journalists. The status or impact of these surveillance tactics are unclear following the end of the Assad regime. Loitering or taking photographs of anything that could be perceived as being of military or security interest may result in questioning, confiscation of the images, or detention by security services. Additionally, U.S. citizens should be aware that conversations on sensitive topics like politics, religion, and other social issues could lead to arrest. It is also illegal in Syria to possess specific-use electronic devices including GPS, short-wave or handheld radio equipment, or similar devices.
