# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

The Department of State continues to warn U.S. citizens against travel to Syria. Over the last 14 years, the Assad regime committed a range of atrocities, some of which rise to the level of war crimes and crimes against humanity. While thousands of former regime and militia members have surrendered weapons and reconciled, some elements or supporters of the former Assad regime remain active in the country and continue fighting with government security forces.  Attacks from terrorists and other armed groups could happen with little or no warning. No part of Syria should be considered immune from violence, and the potential risk exists throughout the country for unpredictable and hostile acts, including kidnappings, sniper assaults, terrorist attacks, small arms fire, improvised explosives, artillery shelling, airstrikes, the use of chemical weapons, large and small-scale bombings, as well as unjust detention, torture, sexual violence, and extrajudicial killings. Individuals also face risk of being killed or injured by unexploded ordnance from the civil war.

**Terrorism:** Terrorist groups and those inspired by them may attempt to target U.S. citizens and interests. Unprotected or vulnerable targets may include.

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Tourist sites, hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship – especially Christian churches
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

Syria has been designated as a State Sponsor of Terrorism since 1979 and the Bashar al-Assad regime gave support to a variety of terrorist groups, affecting the stability of the region. Syria is home to several groups hostile to the United States. Terrorists often do not distinguish between U.S. government personnel and private U.S. citizens. U.S. citizens who choose to travel despite this warning should maintain a high level of vigilance and be aware of their surroundings. It is especially important for travelers to be unpredictable in their movements by varying times and routes and maintaining a low profile.

Some non-state groups maintain anti-U.S. sentiment, which may intensify following significant events in the region, particularly those related to U.S.-Syria relations, international intervention in the ongoing conflict, regional conflicts, and the status of Jerusalem. The presence of terrorist organizations and still-nascent border security measures negatively affect Syria’s stability.

**Crime:** Since the suspension of operations of the U.S. Embassy in Damascus in February of 2012, the U.S. government has not been able to provide accurate information about crime involving U.S. citizens visiting or living in Syria.

Demonstrations may occur in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Demonstrations have turned violent.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**Scams:** Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Syria.

Review the [Department of State’s Protecting Yourself from Scams](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/scams-and-safety/common-frauds-and-scams) pages for more information.

**Technology Usage Abroad:** Mobile devices can be compromised, stolen, or damaged anywhere in the world. Before traveling abroad, it is best to keep all software (operating system and apps) updated. If possible, use a virtual private network (VPN) and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi. It is illegal in Syria to possess specific-use electronic devices including GPS, short-wave or handheld radio equipment, or similar devices.

**Victims of Crime:** If you or someone you know becomes the victim of a crime abroad, you should contact the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate. Czechia, through the U.S. Interests Section of the Czech Embassy in Damascus, currently serves as the Protecting Power for U.S. interests in Syria; however, their ability to provide services is extremely limited.

See our webpage on help for [U.S. victims of crime overseas](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/crime.html).

The U.S. Interests Section, in coordination with nearby U.S. embassies and consulates, may be able to:

* Help you find appropriate medical care
* Assist you in reporting a crime to the police
* Contact relatives or friends with your written consent
* Provide general information regarding the victim’s role during the local investigation and following its conclusion
* Provide information on [victim’s compensation programs in the U.S.](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/crime.html)
* Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution
* Help you find accommodation and arrange flights home
* Replace a stolen or lost passport

The local equivalents to the “911” emergency line in Syria is 110 for ambulance, 113 for fire, and 112 for the police.  Syrian operators usually do not speak English.

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the U.S. Interests Section of the Czech Embassy in Damascus or U.S. Embassy Amman for assistance.

**Tourism:** No formal tourism industry infrastructure is in place on any level.  Tourists are considered to be participating in activities at their own risk.  Emergency response and subsequent appropriate medical treatment are not available in Syria.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.

**Syrian Conflict:** Sources estimate that prior to Asad’s December 2024 departure, the Syrian conflict had resulted in over 500,000 deaths with hundreds of thousands more wounded, arbitrarily detained, or forcibly disappeared since the conflict began in 2011.  The Syrian conflict has resulted in over five million registered Syrian refugees, and millions more displaced inside Syria.  More than 14 million people in Syria need humanitarian assistance.

**Entities Operating in Syria:** The Syrian government controls much of the country, but other armed groups exert control over northeast Syria and pockets of southern Syria. Some armed groups have used car bombs, improvised explosive device/indirect-fire attacks, sniper fire, and carried out kidnappings throughout the country. Foreign combatants – including members of Iran-aligned militia groups, Hizballah fighters, violent extremists, ISIS, and al-Qa'ida (AQ) elements – also participate in hostilities. Additionally, Türkiye engages in military operations in Syria, seeking to counter the influence of the Kurdistan Worker’s Party (PKK), a designated terrorist organization. These operations have reportedly resulted in deaths. Israel has engaged in military operations in Syria that resulted in deaths and has extended its military position into the Area of Separation between Israel and Syria in the Golan Heights and further into Syrian territory.

ISIS no longer controls territory in Syria but continues to operate as an insurgency throughout the country. ISIS continues to pose a significant threat to civilians residing in Syria and has demonstrated the ability to conduct coordinated attacks against armed actors and civilians.  Tactics of ISIS and other violent extremist groups include the use of suicide bombers, kidnapping, small and heavy arms, improvised explosive devices, and chemical weapons. They have targeted major city centers, road checkpoints, border crossings, government buildings, energy infrastructure, shopping areas, and open spaces in Damascus, Aleppo, Hamah, Dara, Homs, Idlib, Deir Ezzor provinces and parts of northeast Syria. These groups have murdered, kidnapped or taken hostage U.S. citizens, both for ransom and political purposes; in some instances, U.S. citizens have disappeared within Syria.  The U.S. government’s ability to help U.S. citizens kidnapped or taken hostage is very limited.

**Kidnapping and Hostage Taking:** There is an ongoing, high risk of kidnapping or hostage taking of U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals throughout the country.  U.S. citizens remain a specific target, with several high-profile abductions having occurred since mid-2012.  U.S. citizen victims have had diverse professional backgrounds, including journalism and humanitarian work. U.S. citizens held captive by ISIS have been murdered by the group, which released videos of killings and publicly took responsibility for their deaths. U.S. citizens also have been abducted by other individuals and groups in Syria, and from various locations, including Damascus and Aleppo.  Other U.S. citizens have gone missing and are believed to have been kidnapped or taken hostage. U.S. citizens’ fate and/or whereabouts remain unknown after being kidnapped or forcibly disappeared in Syria by the Assad regime or non-state actors.

**Detention Issues:** U.S. citizens have been targets of abduction and unjust detention by non-state actors and the previous Assad regime.  Detention conditions are unclear but could include harsh and unsanitary conditions, which can allow for the quick spread of various illnesses.

**Borders:** Porous borders and nascent border security measures have contributed to a complex security environment in Syria, compounded by a protracted violent conflict and influx of foreign fighters.

The Government of Türkiye restricts crossings of its border with Syria and may change border crossing procedures without warning. This restriction applies both to those trying to cross the land border from Türkiye into Syria and to those trying to cross from Syria into Türkiye. Individuals seeking emergency medical treatment or safety from immediate danger are assessed on a case-by-case basis.

U.S. citizens have reported facing dangers traveling within the country and when trying to leave Syria via land borders. Border checkpoints should not be considered safe, as some armed groups have sought funding through kidnappings for ransom. Border areas are frequent targets of shelling and other attacks and are crowded because of internally displaced persons. Errant attacks will occasionally hit border towns just outside the borders as well.

**Engaging in Armed Conflict:** The U.S. government strongly warns U.S. citizens against traveling to Syria to engage in armed conflict. U.S. citizens who undertake such activity face extreme personal risks, including kidnapping, injury, and death. The U.S. government does not support this activity, and our ability to provide consular assistance to individuals who are arrested, injured, or kidnapped, or to the families of individuals who die in the conflict, is extremely limited.

Fighting on behalf of or providing other forms of support to designated terrorist organizations can constitute the provision of material support to a foreign terrorist organization, which is a crime under U.S. law that can result in penalties including prison time and large fines.
