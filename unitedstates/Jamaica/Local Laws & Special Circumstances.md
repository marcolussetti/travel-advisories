# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws.  If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.  Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

Futhermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Firearms:** Jamaica strictly forbids importing or possessing firearms in Jamaica without prior authorization of the Firearms Licensing Authority of Jamaica. A U.S. concealed carry permit does **not** allow you to bring a firearm or ammunition into Jamaica. On November 1, 2022, the Firearms (Prohibition, Restriction and Regulation) Act 2022 went into effect. **This new law includes mandatory minimum sentences of 15 years for possession of even a single cartridge.**

If you bring an unauthorized firearm, firearm components, firearm parts, or ammunition to Jamaica, you **will** be arrested and prosecuted. This will result in a large fine and/or incarceration for an unspecified amount of time. Bringing mace, pepper spray, or knives into Jamaica without authorization will also lead to arrest.

**LGB Travelers:**Jamaican law contains specific prohibitions on “acts of gross indecency” – generally interpreted as any kind of physical intimacy – between persons of the same sex, in public or in private, and provides punishment of up to 10 years in prison. There is also a law that specifically prohibits even consensual same-sex sexual conduct between men.

Negative attitudes towards LGB issues are widespread in Jamaica. There are continued reports of serious discrimination and abuse against LGB individuals, including:

* Assault
* “Corrective rape” of women accused of being lesbians
* Arbitrary detention
* Mob attacks
* Stabbings
* Harassment of LGB patients by hospital and prison staff
* Blackmail

See our [LGB Travel Information](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/lgbt.html) page and section 6 of our [Human Rights Report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

Lesbian, gay, bisexual (LGB) individuals have been targeted through the use of dating apps, especially apps popular within the LGB communities. Criminals have used dating apps to lure foreign visitors into meeting in public spaces such as hotel restaurants and bars, and then later assaulting, threatening , and or robbing the victims. Police have not been responsive in making arrests or prosecuting assailants in these cases.

* Protect your identity and be careful about sharing personal information on your public profile.
* Remember that criminals both in the United States and abroad use dating apps to extort victims through threats to expose compromising pictures or other information.  Only share personal information with users who you trust, and be aware of phishing and romance scams.
* Don’t rush into things; try to verify through social media or mutual friends that the person you are communicating with is who they say they are.  Make sure you have a photo and name of the person you plan to meet through an app.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** The law in Jamaica prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual or mental disabilities, although the law is not reliably enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States.  The most common types of accessibility may include accessible facilities and information. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure. There is a significant difference in accessibility between major cities such as Kingston and Montego Bay compared to accessibility in Jamaica’s smaller communities. Qualified and certified service providers such as sign language interpreters and personal assistants and rental, repair services, and replacement parts for aids, equipment, and devices can be difficult to locate outside of the major cities.
