For emergency services in Jamaica, **dial 119**.

Ambulance services are:

* not widely available and training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.
* not present throughout the country or are unreliable in most areas, especially in rural areas.
* not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment.
* not staffed with trained paramedics and often have little or no medical equipment.
* Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.
* Traffic congestion and road conditions may slow response times.

**We do not pay medical bills.**  Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.  Check with the [Government of Jamaica](https://www.jacustoms.gov.jm/) to ensure the medication is legal in Jamaica.

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

* Public medical clinics lack basic resources and supplies.
* Private hospitals and doctors require payment “up front” prior to service or admission.
* Be aware that some hotels and resorts have exclusive agreements with medical providers, which may limit your choices in seeking emergency medical attention.
* Generally, in hospitals only minimal staff is available overnight in non-emergency wards
* Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals.
* Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions
