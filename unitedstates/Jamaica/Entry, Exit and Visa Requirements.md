# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

U.S. citizens are generally required to present a valid U.S. passport when traveling to Jamaica, as well as proof of anticipated departure from Jamaica. If you are traveling to Jamaica on a cruise, you may use another [Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative](http://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/western-hemisphere-travel-initiative) (WHTI) compliant document. However, we strongly recommend you obtain a passport before travel in case an emergency requires you to disembark and return by air. You do not need a visa for tourist travel up to 90 days. All other travelers will need a visa and/or work permit.

Visit the [Passport, Immigration, & Citizenship Agency of Jamaica](https://www.pica.gov.jm/) or the [Embassy of Jamaica in Washington D.C.](http://www.embassyofjamaica.org/) websites for the most current visa information.

**Exit Information:** Your departure tax is regularly included in the airfare. You won’t be charged an exit tax on your way out.

**HIV/AIDS restrictions:** The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Jamaica.
