# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Crime:** Violent crime, including sexual assault, is a serious problem throughout Jamaica, particularly in Kingston and Montego Bay. Jamaica’s police force often does not respond effectively to serious criminal incidents. When arrests are made, cases are infrequently prosecuted to a conclusive sentence. Families of U.S. citizens killed in accidents or homicides frequently wait a year or more for final death certificates to be issued by Jamaican authorities. Gated resorts are not immune to violent crime.

**Recommendations:**

* Avoid walking or driving at night.
* Avoid public buses.
* Avoid secluded places or situations.
* Do not physically resist any robbery attempt.
* Be aware of your surroundings and keep a low profile.
* Enroll in the [Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)](https://step.state.gov/) to receive Alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.
* Follow the Department of State on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/travelgov) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/travelgov).
* Review the [Crime and Safety Report](https://www.osac.gov/Content/Browse/Report) for Jamaica.
* U.S. citizens who travel abroad should always have a contingency plan for emergency situations. Review the [Traveler’s Checklist](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-checklist.html).

**International Financial Scams:** See the [Department of State](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html)and the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) pages for information. Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Jamaica. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help.  Common scams include:

* Lotteries
* Romance/Online dating
* Money transfers

The most notorious Jamaican scam is the Lotto Scam, a kind of advance-fee fraud. The victim is led to believe that a Jamaican lottery prize will be released after the payment of “fees.”

* You did NOT win a lottery. The person on the telephone is lying. Just hang up.
* Never send money to someone who calls to say you have won the lottery in Jamaica.
* Do not travel to Jamaica to collect a “prize.” Victims have been killed, kidnapped, extorted, or robbed.
* Be very cautious about sending money to help a traveler claiming to be in trouble. When in doubt, contact your local police department for advice and assistance.
* Be wary of promises to protect a loved one from harm or to help the loved one out of trouble, in exchange for money. That is extortion – contact your local police department.
* Scam artists often fake romantic interest to get money from a would-be lover, especially on the internet. When in doubt, contact your local police department.
* If you are being targeted for financial scams, you will need to file a report with your local police department.

**Victims of Crime:** U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance.

Report crimes to the local police at 119 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +1 (876) 702-6000.  Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.

**Sexual Assault:**  Rape and sexual assault are serious problems throughout Jamaica, including at resorts and hotels. Date rape drugs may be used at private parties and resorts.

If you are victim of a sexual assault, contact the police and the U.S. Embassy in Kingston as soon as possible. In a hotel, management should assist you with these communications.

Victims of sexual assault in Jamaica should not expect the same assistance routinely offered in the United States. Rape kits are not always available, and victims must often ask for medication to avoid STD transmission and reduce the chances of pregnancy. Counseling is unlikely to be offered. Law enforcement shortcomings exist in collection of evidence. Prosecution of rape cases moves very slowly, and victims may need to return to Jamaica during the legal process.

**Recommendations:**

* Avoid secluded places or situations, including at resorts. Try to always be accompanied by someone you know, including when going to the restroom.
* Security outside of resort areas is unpredictable, especially at night. Do not leave resort property with someone you have just met.
* Many guests drink heavily in all-inclusive resorts, which can lead to unpredictable behavior and increased vulnerability.
* Shout for help immediately if you feel threatened or encounter individuals who make you feel uncomfortable.
* Report any suspicious or inappropriate activity, including inappropriate comments or behavior by hotel employees or other guests, to hotel management, the U.S. Embassy, and local police as appropriate.R esort employees are generally prohibited from engaging in romantic or sexual relations with guests.

**Domestic Violence:**U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field.  In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
