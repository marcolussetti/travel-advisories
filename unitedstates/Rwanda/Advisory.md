***Updated to remove the Level 4: Do Not Travel area near the border with Burundi and to reflect changes to the Level 4: Do Not Travel areas near the border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo.***

Exercise increased caution in Rwanda due to the potential for **armed violence**. Some areas have an increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.

**Do Not Travel to:**

* **Rusizi District** within 10 kilometers of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) border due to **armed violence**.
* **Rubavu District** within 10 kilometers of the DRC border due to **armed violence**.

**Country Summary:** Armed groups, individuals, and military forces routinely clash in nearby countries. The ongoing violence in these areas raises the risk of spillingover into Rwanda.
