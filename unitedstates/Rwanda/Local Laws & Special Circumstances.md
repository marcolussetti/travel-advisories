# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties**:  You are subject to local laws while in Rwanda. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities prior to practicing or operating a business.

The police may detain you if you are not carrying an acceptable form of identification. Convictions for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs (including marijuana) result in long prison sentences and heavy fines.

Furthermore, some offenses are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Rwanda.html#ExternalPopup) website.

**Arrest Notification**:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

**Local Attorneys**:  You can find a list of local attorneys on the U.S. Embassy’s [website](https://rw.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/).

**Genocide speech**:  Laws about appropriate speech regarding the 1994 genocide in Rwanda are strictly enforced. Promoting ideas based on “ethnic, regional, racial, religious, language, or other divisive characteristics” is prohibited.  Public incitement of “genocide ideology” or “divisionism,” including genocide denial, discrimination, and sectarianism, is punishable by five to seven years in prison and fines of 500,000 to 1,000,000 Rwandan francs. Please refer to the [Rwandan Ministry of National Unity and Civic Engagement’s website](https://www.minubumwe.gov.rw/) for additional information regarding this topic.

**Human Rights Observers, Journalists, NGO workers, and Students**:  Rwandan authorities may subject you to more scrutiny at immigration upon arrival if you meet or plan to meet with individuals or organizations who are critical of the government.

**Photography**:  Photographing military sites, government buildings, airports, and public monuments is strictly prohibited.

**Currency**:  The Rwandan franc (RWF) is the official currency, though U.S. dollars may also be used. Most vendors and banks will only accept U.S. bills printed after 2009, and exchange bureaus and hotels may refuse bills smaller than $100.

**Plastic shopping and grocery bags** are banned and may be confiscated upon arrival.

**Natural disasters**:

* Rwanda is in a seismically active region, which includes Mount Nyiragongo volcano in Virunga National Park. General information about natural disaster preparedness is available from the [U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency: Earthquakes](https://www.fema.gov/earthquake) and at [Ready.gov](https://www.ready.gov/).
* During rainy season from February to May and September to December, Rwanda may experience heavy rains that lead to flooding and landslides. You can monitor weather warnings on the [Rwanda Meteorology Agency](https://www.meteorwanda.gov.rw/index.php?id=2) website.

**Akagera National Park and Wildlife Areas**:  Heed all instructions given by guides and trackers. Approaching wild animals, even in a vehicle, can result in injury or death.

**Drones/Photography**:  A permit is required to fly a drone recreationally or commercially in Rwanda. Please visit the [Rwandan Government’s Tourism](https://www.visitrwanda.com/facts/drones/) website for additional information. Photographing military sites, government buildings, airports, and public monuments is prohibited. Travelers entering Rwanda with drones, must declare the drone upon arrival, will be subject to additional scrutiny, and will be asked to present their permit.

**LGB Travelers**:  There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Rwanda. However, LGB individuals may face societal discrimination and abuse, including harassment by neighbors and police.

See our [LGB Travel Information](/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgb.html) page and section six of our [Human Rights Report](https://www.state.gov/reports/2022-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/rwanda/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities**:  Rwandan law prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, and mental disabilities,  and the government generally enforces these provisions. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure. Access to transportation, lodging, and public buildings is limited, though newly constructed buildings in Kigali have improved facilities, including elevators.  Sidewalks are not common outside of Kigali and do not include curb-cuts.

**Students**:  See our [Students Abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/studentsabroad/en.html) page and [FBI travel tips](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/student-travel-brochure-pdf.pdf/view).

**Women Travelers**:  Domestic violence is common. Although many incidents are not reported or prosecuted, government officials encourage its reporting. Call the Rwanda National Police hotline at 112. See our tips for [Women Travelers](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/Women.html).
