# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

The U.S. Embassy advises all travelers to review the following information:

* Rwanda-[Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/DemocraticRepublicoftheCongoDRC.html) border, including parts of Volcanoes National Park: Tensions between Rwanda and DRC have been elevated since early 2022 with Rwanda and DRC accusing each other of supporting armed groups that pose security threats to the other.  Multiple armed groups opposed to the Rwandan government operate in eastern DRC and have launched occasional incursions into Rwandan territory. Shells struck Rwandan territory in this area several times in 2022. Congolese armed forces and UN peacekeepers continue to conduct combat operations against rebels, militia, and ISIS-aligned groups in DRC’s North and South Kivu provinces, which abut Rwanda.  Violence, rape, kidnapping, killing, pillaging, armed robbery, and roadside criminality occur in these areas and often target civilians.
* Rwanda-[Burundi](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Burundi.html) border, including parts of Nyungwe National Park: Relations between Burundi and Rwanda are currently cordial but in previous years there have been incidents of cross-border incursions, armed clashes and attacks on civilian buses.
* Rwanda-[Uganda](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Uganda.html) border: Relations between Rwanda and Uganda are currently cordial but in previous years there have been elevated tensions in some areas along their shared land border.

**Precautions**:

* Avoid demonstrations and remain vigilant while traveling, especially outside of cities. Even peaceful gatherings can become violent.
* Exercise extreme caution in border areas as the border may not be clearly marked.
* Monitor local news and Embassy [Alerts](https://rw.usembassy.gov/category/messages-for-us-citizens/).
* Obtain permits before entering Rwanda’s national parks.

**Crime:** Most reported incidents involve petty theft and residential and hotel room robberies. Burglars may break and enter, or domestic staff and residential security guards may permit them entry.

**Precautions**:

* Avoid walking alone, especially after dark.
* Do not display cash and valuables.
* Maintain caution in areas frequented by foreigners.
* Drive with doors locked and windows closed.

**Tourism:**  The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities are uncommon. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. Additionally, ambulance services are limited and unreliable. Tourists participate in activities at their own risk. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.  See our webpage for more [information on insurance providers for overseas coverage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html).
