Please visit the [Embassy’s COVID-19 page](https://rw.usembassy.gov/health-alert-covid-19-information/) for more information on COVID-19 in Rwanda.

For emergency services in Rwanda, dial 112 for police, 113 for traffic accidents, or 116 to report abuse by a police officer.

Ambulance services are:

* not widely available and training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.
* not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment.
* not staffed with trained paramedics and often have little or no medical equipment.

Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

**We do not pay medical bills**

U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. Healthcare providers require payment in U.S. dollars/Rwandan francs before services are performed.

**Medical Insurance**

Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/health/insurance-providers.html) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the [Rwanda Food and Drugs Authority](https://rwandafda.gov.rw/)to ensure the medication is legal in Rwanda. Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with little controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, be the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments.

**Air Quality**

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.

* Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in Rwanda.
* For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/).
* For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).
* For general health information, visit the “[Your Health Abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad.html)” page.

**Vaccinations**

Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations recommended](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/rwanda) by the CDC. While the CDC does not generally recommend the [yellow fever](https://www.cdc.gov/yellowfever/index.html) vaccination for travel to Rwanda, the U.S. Embassy recommends travelers bring proof of yellow fever vaccination. The Rwandan government retains the right to turn travelers without the immunization away.

The following diseases are prevalent in [Rwanda](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/rwanda):

* [African Tick-Bite Fever](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/diseases/african-tick-bite-fever)

* [Dengue](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/diseases/dengue)
* [Hantavirus](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/diseases/hantavirus)
* [Hepatitis A](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/diseases/hepatitis-a)
* [Hepatitis B](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/diseases/hepatitis-b)
* [Leptospirosis](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/diseases/leptospirosis)

* [Schistosomiasis](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/diseases/schistosomiasis)
* [Yellow Fever](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/diseases/yellow-fever)

Use CDC-recommended mosquito repellents and sleep under insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets. Chemoprophylaxis is recommended for all travelers even for short stays.

Schistosomiasis, a parasitic infection that can be spread in fresh water, is found in Rwanda. The CDC recommends travelers avoid swimming in fresh, unchlorinated water, such as lakes, ponds, or rivers.

**Health Facilities in General**

* Adequate health facilities are available in Kigali and other major cities but health care, especially in rural areas, may be below U.S. standards.
* Some public medical clinics lack basic resources and supplies.
* Hospitals and doctors often require payment “up front” prior to service or admission. Credit card payment is not always available.
* Private hospitals usually require advance payment or proof of adequate insurance before admitting a patient.

* While English is widely spoken in Rwanda, in certain areas in the country medical staff may speak little or no English.
* Generally, in public hospitals only minimal staff is available overnight in non-emergency wards. Consider hiring a private nurse or having family spend the night with the patient, especially a minor child.
* Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals.

* Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions.

**Pharmaceuticals**

* Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with little controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, be the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments.
* U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/buyingusingmedicinesafely/buyingmedicinefromoutsidetheunitedstates/default.htm) websites for more information.
* Please review Rwandan rules on medication on the [Rwanda Food and Drugs Authority](https://rwandafda.gov.rw/web/) website.

**Water Quality**

* In many areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.

**Food**

* Locally available fruit and vegetables may be contaminated with disease-causing organisms. In addition, these items may also have been treated with pesticides. It is important that all fruits and vegetables be adequately cleaned and prepared before consumption.
