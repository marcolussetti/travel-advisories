# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety**:  Main roads between Kigali and other major towns are generally in good condition. Many secondary and unpaved roads are accessible by four-wheel drive vehicles but lack shoulders and become impassible during the rainy season, February to May and September to December, when flooding and mudslides occur. U.S. Embassy personnel are prohibited from driving outside of cities after dark. Street lighting is limited, and it is difficult to see pedestrians, cyclists, and roaming animals. Additional risks include:

* poor vehicle maintenance

* headlights that are extremely dim or not used
* excessive speeding
* absence of professional roadside assistance.

**Traffic Laws**:  An international driving permit and third-party insurance are required. For specific information concerning Rwandan driving permits, vehicle inspection, road tax, and mandatory insurance, visit the website of the [Rwanda Development Board](https://rdb.rw/).

Cell phone use while driving is illegal unless it is fitted with a hands-free device. After-market tinted window treatments are prohibited on all vehicles.

**Accidents**:  Call the police and remain inside the vehicle until they arrive. If a hostile mob forms or you feel your safety is in danger, leave the scene and proceed directly to the nearest police station to report the incident. Do not stop at the scene of an accident or at intersections where people have gathered, as mobs can develop quickly.

Drivers are responsible for damages if involved in an accident resulting in injuries, even if the driver is not at fault.

Causing a fatal accident could result in up to eight years imprisonment.

Drunk drivers are jailed for at least 24 hours and fined up to $400.

Police roadblocks are common throughout the country. Travelers may be stopped, and vehicles and luggage searched.

**Public Transportation**:  Use only official Kigali city buses and licensed taxis, which are orange striped. Confirm the fare before departure. U.S. Embassy personnel are not permitted to use motorcycle-taxis or mini-bus taxis. They are unsafe due to overloading, reckless driving, inadequate maintenance, and the risk of petty crime. Reputable car services are available for hire. Travel agencies and local hotels may be able to arrange private transport on your behalf.

**Aviation Safety Oversight**: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of Rwanda’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization aviation safety standards for oversight of Rwanda’s air carrier operations.
