Requirements for Entry:

* U.S. passports must be valid for six months after the date of entry into Rwanda.
* Travelers can obtain a Rwandan visa through the following procedures:
  + Obtain a 30-day tourist visa at the port of entry for $50 (single entry) or $70 (multiple entry). Credit cards are generally accepted at the Kigali International Airport but are not accepted at some land borders. The U.S. Embassy recommends that travelers arrive at the Kigali International Airport travel with sufficient cash in U.S. dollars to pay for the visa in case credit card transactions are not possible at the time of your arrival. Additional information about this process can be found on the [Rwandan Immigration website](https://migration.gov.rw/).
  + Obtain 30-day, 90-day, or 10-year tourist visa through the Rwandan Embassy in Washington, D.C. Additional information about this process can be found on the [Rwandan Embassy’s website](https://rwandaembassy.org/).
