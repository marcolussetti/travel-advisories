For emergency services in Macau, dial 999.

Ambulance services are widely available.

**Quality of Care**

Several major hospitals in Macau have adequate medical facilities, and the Kiang Wu and Conde de Sao Januario hospitals can provide emergency medical care. Highly developed medical facilities and trained personnel are available in Hong Kong, which is about an hour by jetfoil ferry, 1-2 hours by car, and twenty minutes by helicopter from Macau.

**The U.S. government does not pay medical bills**

Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance**

Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. See [Insurance Providers for Overseas Coverage page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

**Payment and Insurance**

Travelers will be asked to pay a deposit prior to admission to hospitals to cover the expected cost of treatment. Hospitals and clinics generally accept credit cards.

U.S. Consulate General Hong Kong & Macau maintains a list of local [English-speaking doctors and hospitals](https://hk.usconsulate.gov/medical-assistance/?_ga=2.115987968.745774761.1730957984-708834691.1718595781#macau). We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.

**Medication**

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Prescription drugs are widely available, although names may vary. You need a prescription from a doctor in Macau to purchase medications locally. Bring prescription medications to cover your stay in Macau or plan to see a physician in Macau to obtain a new prescription. If traveling with prescription medication, check with the [government of Macau](https://www.antidrugs.gov.mo/en/) to ensure the medication is legal Macau.

**Air Quality**

Air pollution is an increasing concern in Macau. Congested vehicle traffic and mainland factories emit ozone, sulfur, and nitrogen oxides, leading to a visible haze in the atmosphere on most days of the year. Average roadside pollution levels exceed World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines and may cause health risks for those with allergies, asthma, or cardiac problems.

People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include:

* Infants, children, and teens;
* People over 65 years of age;
* People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema;
* People with heart disease or diabetes; and
* People who work or are active outdoors.

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.

* Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in Macau.
