# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Road conditions differ significantly from those in the United States. Traffic moves on the left and you can expect heavy congestion.

**Traffic Laws:**Many traffic violations are like those in the United States, including penalties for reckless driving, driving under the influence, and using a hand-held device while operating a vehicle. Macau law requires that all registered vehicles carry valid third-party liability insurance.

**Public Transportation:** Taxis are inexpensive and available through a queuing system at the airport, ferry terminal, and gaming venues. Large hotel/casino complexes operate shuttles to ferries and border crossing points. Public buses are also inexpensive and frequent, but you may have difficulty finding them outside major tourist areas.

For specific information concerning Macau driving permits, vehicle inspection, road tax, and mandatory insurance, contact the [Public Security Police Force](https://www.fsm.gov.mo/psp/eng/main.html) (Telephone: +853 2837-4214; Email: [info@fsm.gov.mo](mailto:info@fsm.gov.mo)) or the [Macau Transport Bureau](http://www.dsat.gov.mo/dsat/index.aspx) (Telephone +853 8866-6363; Email: [info@dsat.gov.mo](mailto:info@dsat.gov.mo)).

See our [Road Safety page](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/safety/road.html) and the [official tourism office](https://www.macaotourism.gov.mo/en/) website of Macau for more information on road safety.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**The Macau Civil Aviation Authority is independent from the Civil Aviation Administration of China. As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Macau, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Macau’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s Safety Assessment Page](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa).

**Maritime Travel:**Mariners planning travel to Macau should check for U.S. maritime [advisories](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories) and [alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts). Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard homeport](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings) website, and the [NGA broadcast warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings) website.

The Commandant of the Coast Guard is unable to determine if effective anti-terrorism measures are in place in Macau ports as required by 46 U.S. Code § 70108.
