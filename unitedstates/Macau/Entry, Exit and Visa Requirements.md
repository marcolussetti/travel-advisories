To enter the Macau Special Administrative Region (Macau), you need:

* a passport that is valid for at least ninety days beyond the date of your intended stay;
* adequate funds to cover your stay without working locally
* evidence of onward/return transportation.

You only need a visa if:

* You plan to stay for more than 30 days – obtain an extension with the [Macau Immigration Department](https://www.gov.mo/en/services/ps-1474/ps-1474b/), if necessary.
* You plan to work or study in the Macau, visas must be obtained prior to departing the United States.

Other considerations:

* Departing and then immediately re-entering Macau to start a new stay may result in Macau immigration granting the traveler an authorized stay shorter than the typical 30-day duration;
* You may be granted a stay of up to one year if you enter on your Hong Kong Permanent Identity Card or Hong Kong Re-entry Permit.

You must possess a valid passport and PRC visa to enter the People’s Republic of China (PRC) from Macau. Further information on travel to and around the PRC is available on our [China International Travel Information](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/country/china.html) and [Hong Kong International Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/HongKong.html) pages.

Please note that the official languages of Macau are Chinese and Portuguese. Some websites have no English translation.
