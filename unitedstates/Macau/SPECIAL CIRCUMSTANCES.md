# SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Consular Access:** The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Macau due to PRC Ministry of Foreign Affairs travel restrictions on U.S. diplomatic personnel.

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to Macau laws, including certain PRC laws applied to Macau.  If you violate Macau laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.  Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires a permit or license should seek information from the competent local authorities before practicing or operating a business.

Some crimes committed overseas can be prosecuted in the United States, regardless of local law.  For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [U.S. Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Drug and Alcohol Enforcement:** PRC law enforcement authorities have no tolerance for illegal drugs, including marijuana and products containing cannabidiol, also known as CBD.  Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking illegal drugs in the PRC and Macau, are severe.  Convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences, heavy fines, or the death penalty.

**Identification:** Police have the right to take you in for questioning if you are not carrying a valid travel document (for example, your U.S. passport).

**Photography**: You may be detained if you take pictures of certain buildings.  Pay attention to “no photography” signs, particularly in casinos.

**Driving Under the Influence (DUI):**Driving under the influence of alcohol or other drugs could result in immediate detention.

**Arrest Notification:**

* If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Consulate General Hong Kong & Macau immediately.  See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.
* The PRC and Macau do not recognize dual nationality.  The PRC and Macau may prevent the U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consulates General from providing consular services to dual U.S.-PRC citizens and U.S. citizens with familial or historical ties to the PRC or Macau.  Please see the page on [dual nationality](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/Dual-Nationality-Travelers.html) for more information on the limits on consular notification and access to dual nationals.
* A consular officer may be the only authorized visitor during your initial detention period.  However, due to Macau’s visa requirements, it may take five to seven days for U.S. diplomatic personnel to travel to Macau.  This is true even in an emergency.
* U.S. Consulate General Hong Kong & Macau is unable to represent you in legal matters.

Travelers to Macau should enroll in the U.S. Department of State’s [Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)](https://mytravel.state.gov/s/step).

### **SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES**

**Currency:** There are no currency restrictions for tourists in Macau.  The pataca is the official currency in Macau.  The Hong Kong Dollar and the Chinese renminbi are commonly used and widely accepted in transactions at a one-to-one ratio.  Credit cards and ATM network debit cards are widely accepted in Macau.  Banks and major hotels accept traveler's checks.

**Customs Regulations:**Macau customs authorities strictly enforce import and export regulations regarding items such as firearms, ivory, certain categories of medications, and other goods.  If you bring controlled items into Macau without the necessary Macau documents, even if only transiting, you may be prosecuted, and the goods may be seized.  The penalty for trafficking in dangerous drugs can be life imprisonment and a heavy fine.  Please see the [Macau Customs Service](https://www.customs.gov.mo/cn/index.html) website for further information.

The following is a non-exhaustive list of controlled and/or prohibited items:

* Animals and plants
* Counterfeit goods or illegally produced copies of copyrighted items
* Electronic cigarettes
* Ivory
* Meat and poultry
* Narcotics
* Pharmaceuticals
* Sensitive high technology or military products

Please see our [Customs Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/customs-and-import.html) sheet for general information.

**Dual Nationality:**Dual nationality is not recognized under [PRC nationality law](https://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/residents/immigration/chinese/law.html).  Be mindful of the following special circumstances for dual nationals when traveling in the region.

Enter Macau on your U.S. passport to ensure U.S. Consulate General Hong Kong & Macau can provide consular assistance in case of arrest or other emergency.  Regardless of your travel documents, if you are a dual national, or otherwise have familial or historical ties to the PRC, it is possible that Macau authorities will assert that you are a PRC citizen and deny your access to U.S. consular representatives if you are detained.

Your child will be considered a PRC citizen if one or both parents are PRC nationals, regardless of their U.S. citizenship.

If traveling onward to Mainland China, enter Mainland China on your U.S. passport to ensure U.S. consular protection.  See our [Mainland China International Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/country/china.html) page for more information.

**LGB Travelers:** Same sex marriages are not legally recognized in the PRC and local authorities will not provide marriage certificates to same-sex couples. There are no civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination or harassment based on sexual orientation though homosexuality has been decriminalized. Prejudices and discrimination still exist in many parts of the country. There are growing LGB communities in some of the largest cities in the PRC and violence against LGB individuals in the PRC is relatively rare. See [Section 6 of our Human Rights Practices in the Human Rights Report for Macau](https://www.state.gov/reports/2023-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/china/macau/) and read our [LGB Travel Information page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgb.html).

**Pets:** You must have a permit to bring dogs and cats into Macau.  Additional information on importing pets is available directly from the [Macau Customs Service](https://www.customs.gov.mo/cn/index.html) at +853 2855-9944 or [info@customs.gov.mo](mailto:info@customs.gov.mo).

**Typhoons:**During the typhoon season (July through September), the [Macau Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau](https://www.smg.gov.mo/en) issues typhoon warnings when warranted.  The Bureau has a good notification and monitoring system.  General information about natural disaster preparedness is available from the [U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)](https://www.fema.gov/).

**Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:** Macau law prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, and mental disabilities.  This applies in employment, education, access to health care, or the provision of other state services.  The government generally enforces these provisions.  The law mandates access to public buildings, usually in the form of a ramp, for persons with physical disabilities.  Crosswalks are also required in Macau, and they generally include audible signals for hearing-impaired and raised treading for visually impaired pedestrians.  Handicap-accessible parking is mandated in publicly owned parking lots.  The [Macau Social Welfare Bureau](https://www.ias.gov.mo/en) is primarily responsible for coordinating and funding public assistance programs to persons with disabilities.

For Macau residents who are mobility impaired, the [Macau Social Welfare Bureau](https://www.ias.gov.mo/en) offers free transportation to medical appointments by accessible van through [Caritas Macau](https://www.caritas.org/where-caritas-work/asia/macau/) or the [Macau Red Cross Medical Transfer Service](http://www.redcross.org.mo/en/care_transport.htm).
