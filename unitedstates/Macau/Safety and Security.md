# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

Macau has a low crime rate. Even so, you should exercise caution when in congested areas, pay particular attention to personal belongings while in crowded areas, and while traveling on public transportation. Petty street crime, including pickpocketing, occurs in tourist areas, including in and around casinos and at the airport. Violent crime, though rare, does occur. Protect your personal belongings and travel documents at all times.

* Take routine safety precautions.
* Pay attention to your surroundings.
* Report any concerns to the local police.
* Call “999,” the local equivalent to the U.S.’s “911” emergency line.
* Please note that mace, pepper spray, stun guns, and other self-protection weapons are banned in Macau.
* Don’t buy counterfeit and pirated goods, even if they are widely available. They are not only illegal in the United States, but purchasing them may also violate local law.

Be alert to criminal schemes, such as internet, phone scams, dating scams, as well as financial scams. See the [U.S. Department of State's](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the [U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)'s](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/safety-resources/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes) pages for information on scams.

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact  U.S. Consulate General Hong Kong & Macau and/or the [Macau police](https://www.fsm.gov.mo/psp/eng/main.html) for assistance.

**Tourism**: The tourism industry is generally regulated and best practices and safety inspections are regularly enforced. Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout Macau. Outside of the city center, it may take longer for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
