By Ukrainian law, all foreigners coming to Ukraine must have medical insurance covering their period of travel. Note that the general quality of healthcare in Ukraine does not meet U.S. standards.

* Fees at government clinics and hospitals are lower than those at private clinics, but there have been reports that doctors request bribes or additional payments before treating patients.
* Private physicians and private hospitals charge fees for services, and some do not accept local health insurance.
* Public facilities only accept cash payments, while most private clinics accept credit cards.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance overseas.

**We do not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas*.* We strongly recommend** [**supplemental insurance**](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) **to cover medical evacuation.**

**Medication:** If traveling with prescription medication, check with the [State Register of Medicines](http://www.drlz.com.ua/) (Ukrainian language only) to ensure the medication is legal to bring into the country, as many medications that are legal in the United States are prohibited in Ukraine. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription.

The following diseases are prevalent in Ukraine:

* Influenza
* Tuberculosis

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
