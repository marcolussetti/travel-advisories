# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

* You do not need a visa to enter Ukraine for tourism purposes for visits of up to 90 days in any 180 day period, but must be able to provide proof of valid health insurance and sufficient funds for the duration of your stay.
* No vaccinations are required for entry, but you should be up-to-date on all recommended [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list).
* A visa and residency permit is required for stays over 90 days. You must receive the visa in advance at a Ukrainian embassy or consulate. You cannot get a Ukrainian visa at the airport or at the border. For information regarding visa requirements and to find the nearest Ukrainian embassy or consulate, visit the [Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs](https://mfa.gov.ua/en) or [Embassy of Ukraine in the U.S.](https://usa.mfa.gov.ua/en)
* You must have a visa to apply for a Ukrainian residency permit; you may not do so while on visa-free tourist travel. You must apply with the State Migration Service of Ukraine (SMS) for a residency permit no later than 15 working days before your visa’s expiration date. Once you have a residency permit you can reside in Ukraine for as long as it remains valid. More information is available at the [SMS website](https://dmsu.gov.ua/en-home.html) (limited information available in English).

**Crimea:** There is an extensive Russian Federation military presence in the Crimean Peninsula. Follow the guidance in our [Travel Advisory for Ukraine](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/ukraine-travel-advisory.html) and defer all travel to Crimea. If you choose to travel there, you should be aware:

* U.S. government employees are prohibited from traveling to Crimea and are unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens there.
* You may only legally enter Crimea from mainland Ukraine.
* Entrance into Crimea by any other entry point other than from mainland Ukraine, such as air, sea, or the Kerch Strait Bridge is illegal. You will be denied entry into mainland Ukraine and banned from entering Ukraine for five years.
* Time spent in Crimea will count against the 90 day visa-free period.

**Eastern Ukraine:** Russia-led forces continue to control areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, and the ongoing armed conflict has resulted in more than 10,000 deaths. Follow the guidance in our [Travel Advisory for Ukraine](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/ukraine-travel-advisory.html), and do not travel there. If you choose to travel to these areas, you should be aware:

* U.S. government employees are prohibited from traveling to the eastern parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and to adjacent regions, and the U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens there.
* Entering Ukraine through the area of armed conflict is a violation of Ukrainian law. U.S. citizens who enter Ukraine illegally through the area of armed conflict along the Russian border will not be allowed to pass through government checkpoints to territory controlled by the government of Ukraine.
* Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU) procedures at entry/exit points require that permit applications be submitted and approved electronically prior to travel in the zone of armed conflict.

**HIV/AIDS Restrictions:** The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Ukraine. However, anyone with tuberculosis cannot get permanent residency in Ukraine. There are no waivers or exceptions to this rule.
