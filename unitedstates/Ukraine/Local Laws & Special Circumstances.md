# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. If you are arrested, you can face extended periods, even years, in pre-trial detention. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking illegal drugs are severe, and if convicted you can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. Furthermore, some violations of laws in Ukraine are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrests:** When in a foreign country, you are subject the country’s laws. If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

* Ukrainian law permits police to stop you for any reason and check your identification documents.
* You are required to carry your passport at all times; police may check to verify your legal presence in Ukraine.
* Police are permitted to detain you for up to 72 hours without formal charges.
* If stopped by the police for an unclear reason, call the U.S. Embassy at +38 (044) 521 5000.

**Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:**Accessibility is an issue in Ukraine. Public transport systems are not fully accessible to individuals with disabilities. Some newer buildings feature ramps and elevators, but older buildings do not. You should check ahead with your hotel/destination to learn more about options to accommodate disabled traveler needs before visiting Ukraine.
