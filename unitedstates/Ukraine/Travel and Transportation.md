# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:**

* Generally, roads outside major urban areas are in bad condition and poorly lit.
* U.S. drivers licenses are not valid in Ukraine as their vehicle categories do not meet the standards enumerated in the 1968 Convention on Road Traffic (as amended in 2011). Travelers who do not have a foreign driver’s license that meets these requirements must obtain either a Ukrainian driver’s license or an [International Driving Permit](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/driving-and-road-safety.html).
* You should drive defensively at all times.
* Drivers are often poorly trained; many drive without a valid driver's license.
* Drivers can also be dangerously aggressive; often do not respect the rights of pedestrians, even at clearly marked pedestrian crossings; and sometimes drive on the sidewalks.
* Many cars, including some taxis, do not meet U.S. safety standards.

**In case of accidents:**

* Emergency number: Dial 103 for ambulance service and 102 for police. Ambulance crews do not respond quickly and do not often include trained paramedics.
* Notify the police immediately. By law, police must be notified in the event of an accident. Remain at the scene until the police arrive to conduct an investigation.
* It is a criminal offense to move the vehicle from the site of the accident unless it presents a clear safety concern (causing a traffic jam is not considered a safety concern). In practice, this even includes moving a vehicle to the side of the road.
* You must wait until the police arrive and complete their report; often this can take several hours.
* The police will decide preliminary responsibility, take the drivers’ personal information, seize driver’s licenses, and file an accident report. Temporary driver’s licenses will be issued. Once a court decision has been made regarding responsibility, the original driver’s licenses can be recovered from police. Note that in the vast majority of cases, the police will not speak English.

**Traffic Laws:**

* Ukraine has a zero-tolerance policy for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Violations may result in fines, imprisonment, and/or deportation.
* Non-payment of traffic or parking fines may result in travel bans, which means you cannot leave the country until the fines (plus penalties) are paid.
* Using a cellular telephone or texting while driving is illegal.
* Do not turn right on a red light, unless there is a special green arrow sign attached to the stoplight.
* Front seat belts are mandatory.

**Public Transportation:**

* Only use marked taxis. Fares are given in advance when you order a taxi by phone, but prices are typically negotiated with the driver in advance if hailing a cab in the street.
* Do not sit in the front seat of the taxi, enter a taxi with unknown passengers, or travel to unfamiliar areas.
* Buses and trams are widely used.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the Government of Ukraine’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Ukraine’s air carrier operations. You can find further information on the FAA website at the [FAA safety assessment page](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/).
