# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism Activity:** Credible information indicates that terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Europe. European governments are taking action to guard against terrorist attacks; however, all European countries remain potentially vulnerable to attacks from transnational terrorist organizations.

Small-scale bombings continue to occur throughout Ukraine. While most attacks are at night and appear intended to cause property damage and incite fear, multiple attacks within the past year have been fatal, sometimes occurring in populated areas during daylight hours.

**Please read the** [**Travel Advisory for Ukraine**](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/ukraine-travel-advisory.html) **before traveling.** While in Ukraine, you should carry travel documents with you at all times.

**Potential for civil disturbances:** Large-scale protests have occurred from time to time in cities throughout Ukraine.

* You should avoid large gatherings or protests and adjacent areas.
* In the past, some protests have turned violent and resulted in deaths and injuries.
* Be alert and aware of your surroundings and pay attention to local news media.
* The Embassy will post information about sizeable planned protests on the [Embassy website](https://ua.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/security-and-travel-information/).

**Crimea:** There is extensive Russian Federation military presence in Crimea as part of Russia’s occupation and attempted annexation of this part of Ukraine, which the international community, including the United States and Ukraine, does not recognize. There are continuing abuses against and arbitrary imprisonment of foreigners and the local population by the occupation authorities in Crimea, particularly abuses against individuals who are seen as challenging Russian authority on the peninsula. The U.S. government prohibits employees from traveling to Crimea and is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens there.

**Eastern Ukraine**: U.S. citizens should not travel to the eastern parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts due to ongoing armed conflict.

* The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in this area.
* U.S. citizens have been specifically targeted by gunmen representing the self-proclaimed authorities and threatened, detained, or kidnapped for hours or days.
* Shortages of water, power, medicine, and food supplies have also been reported in Russian-proxy-controlled territory, and widespread disorder and looting has been confirmed in these areas.

**Crime:** Criminals may target tourists due to perceived wealth. A new professional and well-trained police force (Patrol Police) has been implemented, but police corruption remains an issue.

* Criminal activity, including burglaries, robberies, muggings, and pickpocketing is increasingly a problem in Ukraine.
* Law enforcement and emergency officials rarely speak English, and interpreters are not readily available.
* Muggings, attacks, armed robberies, harassment, or the drugging at nightspots of unsuspecting victims (who are then robbed and/or assaulted) have been reported.
* Cases of assaults in apartment building corridors, elevators, and stairwells, as well as armed break-ins and crimes involving firearms, have also been reported.
* Recently, there has been an increase in reports of criminals luring unsuspecting visitors to Ukraine with promises of cheap lodging and/or companionship. The criminals then forcibly abduct the visitors and proceed to make unauthorized transactions via their victims’ bank cards and accounts.
* Many incidents of criminal activity occur on the public transport system, including the metro. When riding on public transportation or moving in crowded areas, keep your purse, bag, or backpack tightly under your arm and/or in front of your body.

**Victims of Crime:** U.S. citizen victim of sexual assault should report crimes to the local police at 102 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +38 (044) 521-5000 after hours.

Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes.

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance. The Embassy will be able to assist with contacting police and provide you with a list of local shelters.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not occur everywhere. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally able to access areas outside of major cities and to provide necessary medical treatment, but it may take time for them to arrive. Local law requires foreigners to have medical insurance when traveling to Ukraine. U.S. citizens are encouraged to consider purchasing additional [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) when arranging their medical insurance for traveling to Ukraine.
