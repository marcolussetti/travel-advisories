Do not travel to North Korea due to **the continuing serious risk of arrest and long-term detention of U.S. nationals.**Exercise increased caution to North Korea due to**the critical threat of wrongful detention.**

* All U.S. passports are invalid for travel to, in, or through the DPRK unless specially validated for such travel under the authority of the Secretary of State.
* Special validations are granted only in very limited circumstances. More information on how to apply for the special validation is available [here](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/requirements/passport-for-travel-to-north-korea.html).

The U.S. government is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in North Korea as it does not have diplomatic or consular relations with North Korea. Sweden serves as the protecting power for the United States in North Korea, providing limited emergency services. The North Korean government routinely delays or denies Swedish officials access to detained U.S. citizens.

Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of North Korea, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information U.S. citizens should consult the [Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/).
