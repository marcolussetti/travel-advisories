# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

U.S. citizens must have a valid U.S. passport to enter Barbados. No visa is needed for stays up to 6 months.

**NOTE:** Generally, all U.S. citizens are required to present a valid U.S. passport when traveling to Barbados, as well as proof of anticipated departure from Barbados. This includes travelers arriving by airplane and by private sea-going vessel. Those traveling to Barbados on a cruise may use another Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI) compliant document. However, we strongly recommend visitors obtain a passport before travel in case of an unforeseen emergency that requires a cruise passenger to disembark and return by air.  
 **HIV/AIDS:**The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Barbados.
