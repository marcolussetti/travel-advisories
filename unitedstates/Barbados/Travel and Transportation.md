# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Main roads are generally safe and well-marked, though they often have potholes. Secondary rural roads tend to be narrow, are sometimes inadequately marked, are potholed and rough, and have frequent blind curves. Use caution on these roads, especially at night. Slow down if you see a stopped vehicle, whether traveling in the same or the opposite direction, as this could mean that pedestrians are crossing. Drivers often stop in the middle of the roadway without warning. Always maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of you and watch for signs of sudden braking.

**Traffic Laws:** Driving is on the left-hand side of the road. Barbados traffic law requires that vehicles involved in an accident remain unmoved until the police arrive.

**Public Transportation:** Registered taxis and large public buses are generally safe. Private vans and small buses are often crowded and tend to travel at excessive speeds. Avoid private minibuses, known as “Zed buses” because of license plates which begin with the letter Z, as drivers frequently drive erratically.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Barbados, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Barbados’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa).

**Maritime Travel:** The U.S. Coast Guard has concerns about the security practices in the ports of Barbados. Until those concerns can be addressed, the Coast Guard advises that Mariners and passengers traveling through the ports of Barbados should exercise caution. Mariners planning travel to Barbados should also check for U.S. maritime [advisories](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.maritime.dot.gov%2Fmsci-advisories&data=05%7C02%7COCSContentManager%40state.gov%7C1e56c9bdae304311c6ee08dcd2762f87%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C638616652251464842%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=LQNYPGZg1u5ihTrMsuvR%2Byn%2FK5hmCSsDP1kAqXJCuKQ%3D&reserved=0 "https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories") and [alerts](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.maritime.dot.gov%2Fmsci-alerts&data=05%7C02%7COCSContentManager%40state.gov%7C1e56c9bdae304311c6ee08dcd2762f87%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C638616652251478127%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=gVPC3XWpRFvQql%2Fo0%2FZnMeWrWzq8PNf5KdZrGz0wIPE%3D&reserved=0 "https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts").
