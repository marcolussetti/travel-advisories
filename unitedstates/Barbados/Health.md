Medical care is good for the region, but medical transport can take hours to respond, and ambulance attendants are prohibited from applying lifesaving techniques during transport.

**We do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare and Medicaid programs do not apply overseas.  
  
**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

If traveling with prescription medication, check with the [government of Barbados](https://www.visahq.com/barbados/embassy/united-states/) to ensure the medication is legal in Barbados. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription.

The following diseases are present:

Chikungunya
