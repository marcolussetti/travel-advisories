# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Summary:**

* Crime is a significant concern. U.S. citizens have been victims of violent crime, including sexual assault, carjacking, home invasions, kidnappings, and armed robberies.
* Tensions between communal or clan groups may result in violent conflict at any time, including in Port Moresby and other urban areas.
* Exercise a high degree of caution in remote areas, as law enforcement presence is extremely limited and tourist and transportation facilities are inadequate.
* Unexploded ordinance and mines may be found in Bougainville, East New Britain, and throughout the Papua New Guinea islands. Exercise caution when walking or hiking off marked roads and trails.
* There has been a recent uptick in small-scale piracy, particularly in waters surrounding Madang and Milne Bay.

**Crime:**Papua New Guinea has a high crime rate.

* Crime rates are highest in and around major cities such as Port Moresby, Lae, Madang, Mount Hagen, and Goroka, but crimes can occur anywhere.
* You are at a greater risk of violent crime such as sexual assault if you travel alone, especially if you plan to hike in isolated rural areas.
* Pickpockets and bag-snatchers frequent crowded public areas, including parks, golf courses, beaches, and cemeteries. Bag-snatchers may try to open doors of automobiles that are stopped or moving slowly in traffic.

**Victims of Crime:** U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes and law enforcement-related emergencies to local police by calling 112. In the event you are unable to get through to the police, operators with St. John Ambulance Service may be able to assist you by passing your request to the police control center. You may also contact the U.S. Embassy at +675 308 2100. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).

**Organized Tours and Adventure Travel**

Organized tours booked through travel agencies remain the safest means to visit Papua New Guinea, although on rare occasions, even persons participating in organized tours have been subject to violent crime and injury. If you choose to travel to Papua New Guinea with a group tour, here are some things to be aware of:

* Excursions to local shops, restaurants, and tourist sights should be done in groups.
* Security protocols, standards of professionalism, and pricing can vary widely among tour operators and local guides.
* Unscrupulous tour guides or criminal elements may attempt to extort money from tour groups and individual travelers through the use of informal roadblocks, unwarranted delays, or by imposing additional undisclosed fees.
* Before making tour arrangements, research tour operators and guides, and compare itineraries through multiple sources, including the [Papua New Guinea Tourism Promotion Authority.](https://www.papuanewguinea.travel/)

**Diving and Snorkeling:** Scuba divers and or snorkelers are advised to check the references, licenses, and equipment of tour operators before agreeing to a tour. Confirm the dive operator is certified through one of the international diving associations, and that their certification is current. Confirm with the diving association directly that the operator is certified. Local dive masters may not consider your skill level when they organize a trip.

Rent equipment only from trustworthy operators and be sure to receive training before using the equipment. Some rental diving equipment may not be properly maintained or inspected. Make sure that your travel medical insurance covers your sport. The [Divers Alert Network (DAN)](https://www.diversalertnetwork.org/) website has information on diver’s insurance.

Deaths and serious accidents have occurred in the past because basic safety precautions were not taken during diving and snorkeling trips. Remember that safety measures and emergency responses may not meet U.S. standards.

Papua New Guinea has one hyperbaric recompression chamber to provide medical assistance for dive-related injuries, located in Port Moresby at the Tropicair Hangar at Jacksons International Airport. However, it may not always be operational. Diving injuries may therefore require medical evacuation to Australia. Many popular dive sites are located near outlying islands, and it may take several hours to reach facilities in the event of an accident.

**Other Water Sports:** Exercise caution and common sense when engaging in all adventure sports, including but not limited to whitewater rafting, sea kayaking, and windsailing. Make sure your travel medical insurance covers your sport. Never participate in adventure sports alone. Before kayaking, rafting, or windsailing, check water conditions and wear a life jacket and helmet. Water conditions may become extremely dangerous during heavy rainfall, and flash floods are common.

**Hiking:** Exercise caution if you plan to hike the Kokoda Track, the Black Cat Track, Mt. Wilhelm, Mt. Giluwe, or other established or informal hiking trails in Papua New Guinea. Hikers have been attacked and killed, even along the most well-known routes. Local landowners occasionally threaten to close parts of the tracks due to local land and compensation disputes. Carry a first aid kit and observe all local and trail-specific regulations.

**Demonstrations** occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

* Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent.
* Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**International Financial Scams:**See the [Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) pages for information.

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.
