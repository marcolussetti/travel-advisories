# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from relevant local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**LGB Travelers:** Same-sex sexual relations are criminalized in Papua New Guinea. Papua New Guinea is a conservative country and public displays of affection are generally not understood or welcomed.

Seeour [LGB Travel Information](/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgb.html)page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports-bureau-of-democracy-human-rights-and-labor/country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details.

**Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance**. Papua New Guinea does not have legislation mandating access to transportation, communication, and public buildings for persons with disabilities. The road network in Papua New Guinea is in poor condition. Foot paths, road crossings, and stairways in most major towns are congested, uneven, and are generally not constructed or maintained with an eye toward access for persons with disabilities.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** The law in Papua New Guinea prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, or mental disabilities, but is not enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure in both rural and urban areas, including the capital. The availability of rental, repair and replacement parts for aids/equipment/devices, or service providers, such as sign language interpreters or personal assistants is limited.

**Students:** See our [Students Abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/students.html) page and [FBI travel tips](https://ucr.fbi.gov/investigate/counterintelligence/student-brochure).

**Women Travelers:** Sexual assault and gender-based violence are relatively common in Papua New Guinea. Though most often reported in urban centers and against the local population, these attacks can occur anywhere and also be directed against tourists or foreign residents. Police have limited capacity to respond to such crimes and health workers at local medical facilities may not be adequately trained or have the capacity to provide victim-centered care or administer post exposure prophylaxes. Women are advised of the following precautions:

* Do not travel alone, and if possible travel with a group of people you trust.
* Avoid public transport, especially after dark.
* Limit evening entertainment to venues with professional security.
* Avoid isolated areas when alone at any time of day.
* Respect local dress and customs. Customary everyday dress for women throughout the country is conservative, and even more so in non-urban areas, with women wearing clothing that covers their shoulders and their legs past the knees.
* Ask if your lodging has a female-only floor or section. Some hotels in Papua New Guinea offer this option.

**Special Circumstances:**

**Customs:** Papua New Guinean customs authorities enforce strict regulations governing firearms, certain prescription drugs, wooden artifacts, animal products, food, and sexually explicit material. Firearms should not be brought into the country. Other products may be subject to quarantine. You should contact the [Embassy of Papua New Guinea](http://www.pngembassy.org/) in Washington, D.C. for specific information regarding customs requirements.

**Natural Disasters:** Papua New Guinea is among the most disaster-prone countries in the world. Earthquakes, tropical cyclones, destructive tsunamis, exceptionally high tides, seasonal and flash flooding, and landslides can occur with little or no notice. The country has many active volcanoes. Recent eruptions have occurred in in Bougainville, East and West New Britain, and Manam Island. Ash from volcanoes in East and West New Britain occasionally disrupts air and ground operations at the airports in Kokopo and Hoskins.

**Documentation:** Carry a copy of your U.S. passport and Papua New Guinean visa at all times so that you can demonstrate your proof of identity, U.S. citizenship, and immigration status to authorities if asked.
