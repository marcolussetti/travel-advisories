For emergency services in Papua New Guinea, dial 111 to reach St. John Ambulance Service.

Ambulance services are:

* Not present throughout the country or are unreliable in most areas except for Port Moresby and other major urban areas.
* Not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment.
* Not always staffed with trained paramedics and/ or may have little or no medical equipment.
* Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

**We do not pay medical bills**

Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance**

Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation, as severe injuries often require medical evacuation to Australia, Singapore, the Philippines, or the United States at a cost of thousands of dollars. Medical evacuations to Australia require a visa or [Electronic Travel Authority](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/electronic-travel-authority-601).

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the [Embassy of Papua New Guinea](http://www.pngembassy.org/) to ensure the medication is legal in Papua New Guinea.

**Vaccinations**

Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Health facilities in general**

* Health facilities are available in Port Moresby and other major urban areas, but health care may be below U.S. standards or vary greatly between locations.
* Public medical clinics often lack basic resources and supplies.
* Hospitals and doctors may require payment “up front” prior to service or admission, and credit card payment is not always available.
* Private hospitals usually require advance payment or proof of adequate insurance before admitting a patient.
* Generally, in public hospitals, only minimal staff is available overnight. Consider hiring a private nurse or having family spend the night with the patient, especially a minor child.
* Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals.
* Psychological and psychiatric services are extremely limited, even in Port Moresby and other urban areas. Hospital-based care is only available through one government institution in Port Moresby.

**Pharmaceuticals**

* Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with little controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments.
* U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/buyingusingmedicinesafely/buyingmedicinefromoutsidetheunitedstates/default.htm) websites for more information.
* Persons arriving in Papua New Guinea are advised to travel with copies of any prescriptions for medication. Common prescription and over-the-counter medications are generally available at pharmacies located in major urban areas.

**Water Quality**

* In many areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.

**Air Quality**

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.

* Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in Papua New Guinea.
* For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/).
