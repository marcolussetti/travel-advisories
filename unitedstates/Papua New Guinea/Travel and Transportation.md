# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Motor vehicle accidents are a common cause of serious injury in Papua New Guinea. Road travel outside of major towns can be hazardous due to car jackings, armed robbery, and criminal roadblocks near bridges, curves in the road, or other areas where vehicle speed and mobility is restricted. Be sure to:

* Lock your doors and keep your windows rolled up.
* Drive in convoys and avoid driving after dark, if possible.
* Hire a reputable driver or private transport service.
* Consult with local law enforcement officials concerning security conditions before driving between towns.
* Wear a seatbelt at all times.

**Safety risks include:**

* Roads are in a poor state of repair, especially in rural areas.
* Erratic and intoxicated drivers
* Poorly maintained vehicles
* Over-crowded vehicles
* Landslides, especially during the rainy season along stretches of the Highlands Highway between Lae and Mount Hagen
* Car jackings, armed robberies, and criminal roadblocks, particularly along the Highlands Highway

**Traffic Laws:** Traffic in Papua New Guinea moves on the left. Police roadblocks to check vehicle registrations are a regular occurrence at night in Port Moresby, and police may not always act in a professional manner. As a driver, you should ensure that your vehicle registration and safety stickers are up-to-date in order to minimize difficulties at police checkpoints.

**If You Are Involved in a Road Accident:** Crowds can react emotionally and violently after road accidents.  Crowds form quickly after an accident and may attack those whom they hold responsible by stoning and/or burning vehicles. Friends and relatives of an injured party may demand immediate compensation from the party they hold responsible for injuries, regardless of legal responsibility. If you are involved in an accident and you feel threatened, go directly to the nearest police station instead of remaining at the scene of the accident.

**Public Transportation:** Avoid using local taxis or buses, known as Public Motor Vehicles (PMVs), as crimes such as robbery and sexual assault on buses are not uncommon. Use a reliable service provided by your hotel, employer, or colleagues.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Papua New Guinea, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Papua New Guinea’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards.  Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/).

Persons arriving on or transiting through Papua New Guinea on sailboats or yachts should be aware that small-scale piracy can occur and has recently been reported near Madang and Milne Bay.
