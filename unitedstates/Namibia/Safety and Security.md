# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Road Travel:**Namibia has thousands of miles of unpaved roads. Road accidents, particularly on gravel roads, pose the most serious threat to visitors. Many gravel roads are well-maintained and can provide unaccustomed drivers a false sense of security, with road conditions shifting dramatically in certain areas. See recommendations below on road safety in Namibia.

**Crime:**Non-violent crimes of opportunity are the most common incidents reported by foreigners and include pick pocketing, purse snatching, ATM card skimming, and vehicle thefts and break-ins. Criminals sometimes brandish knives and guns. Violent crimes, including murder and rape, and property crimes increased in Windhoek over the last year. Robberies occur at roadside rest stops.

* Dress conservatively.
* Avoid walking alone, especially after dark, and displaying cash and valuable personal property.
* Make sure your hotel room or residence is well secured, including windows.
* Keep your credit card in your sight at all times while it is being processed. Consider using prepaid credit cards with limited funds when traveling.
* Take rest breaks in towns and/or at gasoline stations.

**Transport crimes:** Violent assaults on taxi passengers are known to occur; petty theft is prevalent and occurs on trains, buses, and in taxis.

* Be aware of criminals using remote key fobs to unlock vehicle doors in parking lots.
* Drive with doors locked and windows closed.
* Keep valuables out of sight and do not use cell phones or laptops while stopped in traffic; bandits may use smash and grab tactics to steal valuables.
* Hire taxis through a hotel or retain the services of a reputable private transport company.

**Checkpoints:** The police maintain checkpoints approximately 9 miles (15 km) outside of main cities and all major highways. During the holiday season, additional checkpoints may be established along the Windhoek-Swakopmund highway (B1).

* Remain inside your vehicle with doors locked and open the window slightly to communicate.
* Be prepared to produce vehicle registration documents, personal identification (passport, Namibian identification cards), car rental contracts, and/or drivers’ licenses.
* Proceed only when waved through.

**Domestic Violence:**  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.

**Tourism:**The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).
