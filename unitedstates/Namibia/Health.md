Consult the [CDC website for Namibia](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/namibia?s_cid=ncezid-dgmq-travel-single-001) prior to travel.

Medical facilities in the capital of Windhoek and in large towns are capable of providing emergency care and performing many routine procedures. Doctors and dentists are generally well-trained. Well-equipped facilities are rarely available in smaller towns. Carry prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription. Be sure to verify with the Namibian Ministry of Foreign Affairs that your medications are legal before you travel.

**We do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance coverage.

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

Use the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended mosquito repellents and sleep under insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets.  Chemoprophylaxis is recommended for all travelers even for short stays.

**HIV/AIDS:** The United States works in partnership with the Government of Namibia to fight HIV/AIDS while promoting sustainable national ownership and leadership of HIV/AIDS programs. (Through PEPFAR, USAID and the Ministry of Health and Social Services). PEPFAR is the largest commitment by a single nation towards an international health initiative and in Namibia, PEPFAR has contributed over US$1.1 billion for HIV/AIDS activities since its inception in 2003.

Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about [Resources for Travelers](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/traveler-information-center) regarding specific issues in Namibia.

For emergency services in Namibia, dial Police; +264(63)10111. E-Med Rescue 24, dial 081 924 (from Cell), 061 411 600 (landline); AEMS Ambulance Services, dial 081 963 (from Cell), 061 300 118 (landline).

**Ambulance services are:**

* not widely available, particularly outside of major cities, and training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.
* Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance. Response times for ambulance services could be up to twenty minutes.

**Vaccinations:**

Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/namibia#vaccines-and-medicines)recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Air Quality:** The air quality varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons. It is typically at its worst in the Spring. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include:

* Infants, children, and teens
* People over 65 years of age
* People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema;
* People with heart disease or diabetes
* People who work or are active outdoors

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas. Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in [destination]. For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/). For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/). For general health information, visit the “[Your Health Abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad.html)” page.

The U.S. Embassy maintains a [list of doctors and hospitals](https://na.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/local-resources-of-u-s-citizens/doctors/). We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.

**Health facilities in general**

* Adequate health facilities are available in city and other major cities but health care in rural areas may be below U.S. standards.
* Hospitals and doctors usually require payment “up front” prior to service or admission. Credit card payment is not always available.  Some hospitals and medical professionals require cash payment.
* Private hospitals **usually** require advance payment or proof of adequate insurance before admitting a patient.
* Medical staff may speak little English outside of Windhoek, especially in rural areas.
* Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals.
* Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions

**Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery**

* Medical tourism is a rapidly growing industry. People seeking health care overseas should understand that medical systems operate differently from those in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations. Anyone interested in traveling for medical purposes should consult with their local physician before traveling and visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/medical-tourism) website for information on Medical Tourism, the risks of medical tourism, and what you can do to prepare before traveling to Namibia.
* We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/health/insurance-providers.html) to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications.
* Your legal options in case of malpractice are very limited in Namibia.
* Persons traveling to Namibia for medical purposes require the proper “medical” visa. Check the Government of Namibia’s [website](https://namibiaembassyusa.org/foreign-nationals/) for more information.

**Pharmaceuticals**

* U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/) websites for more information.

**Water Quality**

* In many areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.

**Altitude**

* Many cities in Namibia are at high altitude. Be aware of the symptoms of altitude sickenss, and take precautions before you travel. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about [Travel to High Altitudes](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/travel-to-high-altitudes).
