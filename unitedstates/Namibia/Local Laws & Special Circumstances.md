# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:**  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.  Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) website.

**Diamonds:**  Do not purchase diamonds and other protected resources outside of licensed retail establishments. If you are convicted of illegally dealing in diamonds, you can face up to 20,000 U.S. dollars in fines and/or five years in prison.

**Wild animal parts:**  Unlicensed purchase of or trading in endangered wildlife parts, such as ivory and rhino horn, is illegal and carries severe penalties including fines up to 1.1 million U.S. dollars and 15 years in prison. Furthermore, it is illegal to kill or capture any protected wild animals without appropriate permits.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

**Photography:**  It is illegal to take pictures of government buildings, military installations, and key infrastructure, such as ports, train stations, airports, and along border areas. You could be fined, have your photographic equipment confiscated, and risk detention and arrest. Do not take photos of people without their permission.

**Phone Service:**  Cellular phones are the norm, as landlines are only in urban areas. It is possible to purchase a SIM card locally and use a U.S.-compatible cell phone.

**Currency:**  The Namibian dollar (NAD) is the official currency. It is pegged to the South African rand, which is also legal tender in Namibia. Carefully inspect ATMs for skimming technology before using. Credit cards are generally accepted.

**Wild Animal Parks**: Heed all instructions given by guides or trackers. Use common sense and maintain a safe distance when approaching wildlife. Even in the most serene settings wild animals pose a lethal threat. Lions, leopards, elephants, oryxes, rhinos, hippos, and crocodiles have critically injured and killed individuals in the region.

Baboons live throughout Namibia and commonly scavenge the belongings of travelers. Baboons in camping areas are quite bold in approaching and taking items that interest them; they can be aggressive.  Keep your belongings and food in secure containers.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:**Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ccips) for more information.

**Adventure activities:**  Climbing areas, 4X4 trails, hiking trails, and rivers are unpredictable and dangerous. They are often located in isolated areas without access to communications and away from any medical assistance. Dozens of people, including U.S. citizens, have been injured or drowned.

* Leave a copy of your identification, travel documents, and an itinerary with the hotel reception desk when you go on excursions to assist police/rescue teams in the event of a problem.
* Bring sufficient water and supplies, including a satellite phone preprogrammed with emergency numbers.
* Provide a detailed travel plan and return date to family and friends in the United States before your excursion.

**LGB Travelers:**  Homosexuality is not illegal but sodomy between men is criminalized, though the ban is not enforced. Many Namibians consider all same-sex sexual activity taboo.

See our  [**LGB** Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgbti.html) page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports/2020-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/)for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** The law in Namibia prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual or mental disabilities, and the law is enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is as prevalent as in the United States. The most common types of accessibility may include accessible facilities and information to services. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication and general infrastructure. Contact the US Embassy in Namibia to receive a list of providers.

**Students:**  See our [Students Abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/studentsabroad/en.html) page and [FBI travel tips.](https://ucr.fbi.gov/investigate/counterintelligence/student-brochure)

**Women Travelers:** There are frequent reports of rapes, particularly in informal settlements. Only a small fraction of rape cases are prosecuted and fewer still result in conviction. Gender-based Violence Protection Units intervene in cases of domestic violence, which is widespread. Units are staffed with police officers, social workers, legal advisors, and medical personnel trained to assist victims of sexual assault. A privately run shelter operates in the Khomas region and there are government shelters in other regions.
