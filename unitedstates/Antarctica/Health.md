Antarctica has no hospitals, pharmacies, or doctor’s offices. Although cruise ships and land-based expeditions should have the capacity to treat minor ailments, medical emergencies often require evacuation to a country with modern medical facilities, which could require travel over a significant distance. There is no guarantee that transportation would be available or that weather conditions would allow for transportation, even in an emergency.

* Search and rescue resources in Antarctica are extremely limited.  Cost of search and rescue efforts are borne by the person/s in need of the assistance. Travelers should obtain comprehensive travel, medical, and medical evacuation insurance prior to departure; see our webpage for more [information on overseas insurance coverage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).
* There are no public utilities, such as phone or Internet service providers, in the Region.

**We do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/)

**Air Quality**

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.

* Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in Antarctica.
* For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/).
* For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).
