# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:**Â Some Treaty Parties, including those that have claimed territory in Antarctica, may seek to apply their laws to persons in Antarctica. Furthermore, some laws remain applicable to certain persons in Antarctica and may subject them to prosecution in the U.S. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained in transit to/from Antarctica, ask police or prison officials to notify a U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [arrest webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctica Treaty designates Antarctica as a natural reserve. Additionally, the [Antarctic Conservation Act](https://www.nsf.gov/geo/opp/antarct/aca/aca.jsp), which protects native mammals, birds, plants, and their ecosystems, applies to all U.S. citizens and expeditions that originate from the United States.

Several areas are afforded special protections as they have been designated as having ecological, scientific, historical, or other significance.

It is forbidden to bring any non-native species into Antarctica. This includes live poultry, domestic animals, and household plants or seeds.

It is prohibited to take or harmfully interfere with Antarctica wildlife except in accordance with a permit issued by a national authority.
