# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Environmental Hazards:**

* The greatest threats to travelers to the Antarctic Region are environmental hazards posed by the severe elements and changeable weather.
* Among the more common threats are frostbite, dehydration, eye damage from reflected glare, overexposure to the sun, and boat accidents.
* Additionally, emergency response capabilities including search and rescue are restricted, if not impossible, due to complex coordination, limited availability, long distances, and environmental hazards. If you experience an emergency in Antarctica, you may have significant difficulty getting help.

In general, U.S. embassies and consulates can help in the following ways, though some of these services may not be available until you have left Anartica and arrived in the embassy or consulate's country:

* Help you find appropriate medical care
* Assist you in reporting a crime to the police. See our webpage on [help for U.S. victims of crime overseas.](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/crime.html)
* Contact relatives or friends with your written consent
* Provide general information regarding the victim’s role during the local investigation and following its conclusion
* Provide a list of local attorneys
* Provide information on [victim’s compensation programs in the U.S.](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/crime.html)
* Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution
* Help you find accommodation and arrange flights home
* Replace a stolen or lost passport

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact an Embassy or Consulate for assistance.

**Tourism:** No formal tourism industry infrastructure is in place on any level. Tourists are considered to be participating in activities at their own risk. Emergency response and subsequent appropriate medical treatment is not available in Antarctica. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
