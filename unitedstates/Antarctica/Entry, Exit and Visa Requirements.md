# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

**Passports and Visas: A U.S. passport is required for travel through the country or countries that you transit through en route to and from Antarctica. Please refer to the separate country information pages for those countries.**

**Expeditions to Antarctica:**

Any expedition to the Antarctic Region could have an impact on the environment and its ecosystems. To manage those risks and impacts, the Antarctic Treaty and the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty establish certain obligations on the Treaty Parties with regard to expeditions to the Antarctic Treaty area.

The Treaty obliges each Party to give advance notification of all expeditions to and within Antarctica, on the part of its ships, aircraft, or nationals, and all expeditions to Antarctica organized in or proceeding from its territory.

U.S. tourists who have booked passage to Antarctica on a commercial cruise regulated by an Antarctic Treaty Party, such as those that are a member of the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators ([IAATO.org](https://iaato.org/)), normally would be covered by the vessel operator’s and/or tour company’s advance notification. Always check with your tour operator about advance notification coverage.

Any U.S. nationals organizing a private expedition to Antarctica in the United States, or proceeding to Antarctica from the United States, should initiate the process by notifying the Department of State at least three months prior to the intended travel to the Antarctic Treaty area. Contact the Department of State’s Office of Ocean and Polar Affairs for additional information at [Antarctica@state.gov](mailto:Antarctica@state.gov).

Visit the [International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators website](https://iaato.org/) for more information on visitor guidelines.
