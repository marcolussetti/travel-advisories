**COVID-19 Testing:** COVID PCR and antigen tests are available for U.S. citizens in Iceland and results are available within 72 hours. PCR tests that are not conducted upon request are at the citizen’s expense and average 7000ISK or $54. Antigen rapid tests are provided by private companies and the price varies between them. Test results are provided via text message or via e-mail.

**COVID-19 Vaccines:** The COVID-19 vaccine is available for U.S. citizens to receive in Iceland. Visit the FDA's website to [learn more about FDA-approved vaccines](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-vaccines) in the United States.

Medical care in Iceland is of high quality, but limited services are available outside large, urban areas. The Icelandic medical system offers coverage only for people who live in Iceland. Non-residents are expected to pay their own medical costs, and you should be prepared to pay your bill in full before leaving the hospital or clinic.

For **emergency services** in Iceland, **dial 112**. For non-emergency medical assistance in the Reykjavik metropolitan area, dial 544-4114 during business hours. During non-business hours, dial 1770.

Ambulance services are:

* Not present throughout the country or have long response times  except in or near major population areas such as Reykjavik.  Iceland does have air ambulance services, but they are limited by weather and distance to the patient.
* **We do not pay medical bills**. Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance**: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments, though most hospitals and clinics in Iceland do accept credit cards.  See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance coverage overseas.  Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.  Check with the [government of Iceland](https://www.ima.is/licences/importation-by-individuals-of-medicinal-products-for-personal-use/) to ensure the medication is legal in Iceland. Please review the [CDC guidance on purchasing medicine overseas.](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/counterfeit-medicine)

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations recommended](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm) by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
