**Criminal Penalties:**You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.  Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

* Importation of whale products to the United States: All persons are barred from importing whale products to the United States.
* The [Marine Mammal Protection Act](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/marine-mammal-protection/marine-mammal-protection-act-policies-guidance-and-regulations) makes it illegal to bring back whale products to the United States.
* Any importation of products containing whale to the United States will result in the seizure of the goods and possible criminal prosecution. Penalties include jail time and fines of up to $10,000.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law.
