**Road Conditions and Safety:**Driving in Iceland is on the right side of the road, as in the United States.

* All travelers in Iceland are strongly encouraged to monitor weather and road safety year-round through [safetravel.is](https://safetravel.is/) and [road.is](https://www.road.is/) through the web or smart device applications.
* While in Iceland, you may encounter road conditions that differ significantly from those in the United States**. Less than one-third of Iceland’s total road network is paved**, and many roads outside the capital, especially those that run through the center of the country, are **impassable in winter** (October through April).
* Many bridges are only one lane wide (marked with a sign “Enibreid bru”) so drivers must be alert to oncoming traffic. There are also one-lane tunnels with pullout zones to yield to oncoming traffic.
* **Extreme care** should be taken when driving in rural areas during the winter when daylight hours are limited and the weather and road conditions can change rapidly.
* Many routes in the interior of the country are **impassable** until July due to muddy conditions and swollen rivers caused by snowmelt.
* **Always inform someone of your travel plans**.

For information on current road conditions throughout the country please consult [The Icelandic Road and Coastal Administration (Vegagerdin)](http://www.road.is/) website. This website can show you in real time the status of most roads in Iceland, color-coded by status.

**Traffic Laws:**You can use a valid U.S. driver’s license for up to 90 days while visiting Iceland, but you must be at least 17 years old to drive.

* Icelandic law requires drivers to keep **headlights on at all times**.
* **Talking on cell phones while driving is prohibited**, except when using a hands-free system, and is subject to a fine of 5,000 Icelandic Kronur (approximately $45).
* **Driving under the influence of alcohol is a serious offense in Iceland**. Drivers can be charged with Driving Under the Influence with a blood alcohol level as low as .05%.
* Unless otherwise posted, the speed limit is **50 km/h** in urban areas and **30 km/h** in residential areas.
* In rural areas, the speed limit depends on the type of road: on dirt and gravel roads, the speed limit is **80 km/h (50 mph)**; on paved highways, the speed limit is **90 km/h (55 mph)**.
* It is **illegal** to turn right on a red light.
* In **traffic circles**, always yield to cars coming from the left/ the inside lane.
* **The use of seatbelts is mandatory** in both the front and rear seats.
* **Children under the age of six** must be secured in a size and weight appropriate car seat.
