# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:**Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

**Crime:**Iceland has a low crime rate with rare instances of violent crime. Using common sense will go a long way in ensuring you do not become a victim.

* Do not put bags containing valuables, such as your passport, on the floor in bars or nightclubs.
* Do not leave your valuables in parked vehicles, even if the vehicle is locked.
* Be aware that downtown Reykjavik can become disorderly in the late night to early morning hours as people are leaving bars and clubs.

**International Financial Scams:**See the [Department of State](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html) and the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) pages for information on scams.

**Victims of Crime:**Report crimes to the local police by dialing 112 and contact the U.S. Embassy at [ReykjavikConsular@state.gov](mailto:ReykjavikConsular@state.gov). After working hours, call +(354)595-2248. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.

**Domestic Violence**: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence should dial 112 for immediate emergency assistance and may contact the Embassy for non-emergency assistance.

The [Icelandic Red Cross](https://www.raudikrossinn.is/english/projects/domestic-projects/health-and-wellbeing/helpline-1717-and-chat-1717is/) has a helpline that is open 24 hours a day, every day, for anyone needing assistance with grief, anxiety, fear, depression, or suicidal thoughts. Dial 1717 to reach Red Cross volunteers in Iceland.

**Tourism:**The tourism industry is generally regulated, and rules are regularly enforced; and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is sporadic due to limited hours and geographic distance from care. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first-responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. U.S. citizens are strongly encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).
