# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

Passports and Visas:

* A valid passport is required.

* For U.S. passport holders, a visa is not necessary for stays up to 90 days.

* A residence permit is needed for stays longer than 90 days.  The residence permit can be obtained from the central police station of the district of residence in Tunisia.

* U.S. citizens born in the Middle East or with Arabic names have experienced delays in clearing immigration upon arrival in Tunisia.

* The Government of Tunisia expects all U.S. citizens of Tunisian origin and who are dual American-Tunisian citizens to enter and exit Tunisia on their Tunisian passports.  If a Tunisian-American succeeds in entering using a U.S. passport, he or she will still have to present a valid Tunisian passport to exit the country.

The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Tunisia.
