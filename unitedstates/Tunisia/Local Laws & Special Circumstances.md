# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.  Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

* Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Tunisia are severe, and convicted offenders can expect heavy fines and long jail sentences.
* You may be taken in for questioning if you don’t have your passport with you or if you take pictures of certain buildings.
* It is against Tunisian law to photograph police, military, and government buildings.
* Driving under the influence of alcohol could land you immediately in jail.
* If you break local laws in Tunisia, your U.S. passport won’t help you avoid arrest or prosecution.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information on consular assistance when a U.S. citizen is arrested.

The Tunisian government is required by international law to contact the U.S. embassy promptly when a U.S. citizen is arrested.  This requirement does not apply to dual U.S.-Tunisian nationals.  
  
**Firearms and Ammunitions:** In general, it is illegal for travelers to carry firearms other than a hunting weapon, which requires special authorization, and ammunition (even used shells). If you are caught entering Tunisia with a weapon or ammunition, you may face severe penalties, including prison time. U.S.-issued permits allowing an individual to carry weapons are not valid in Tunisia.  Visit the Department’s [Traveling Abroad with Firearms webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/traveling-abroad-with-firearms.html).

**Drones:** Importation of all types of drones, including small civilian drones used for personal or touristic purposes is strictly prohibited without prior governmental authority. **Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ccips) for more information.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** The law in Tunisia prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities, and the law is generally enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is as prevalent as in the United States. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure.
