***Reissued to update information to high-risk areas, country summary, and the “If you decide to travel” section, and Level 4 “Do Not Travel” areas.***

Exercise increased caution in Tunisia due to terrorism. Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.

Do not travel to:

* Within 16 km of the Algerian border due to terrorism, except for the cities of Tabarka and Ain Draham.
* Within 16 km of the border with Libya due to terrorism.
* The Mount Chaambi National Park, Mount Salloum, Mount Sammamma, and Mount Mghila in Kasserine governorate due to terrorism.
* The Mount Orbata area in the Gafsa governorate due to terrorism.
* The desert south of Remada due to the military zone.

**Country Summary:** Terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Tunisia. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, museums, resorts, hotels, festivals, nightclubs, restaurants, religious sites, markets/shopping malls, government facilities and security forces. A country-wide state of emergency, which grants security forces more authority to maintain civil order and enables the government to focus on combating terrorism, is in effect.

The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in some areas of Tunisia.

Read the [country information page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Tunisia.html) for additional information on travel to Tunisia.

If you decide to travel to Tunisia:

* Exercise caution when using public transportation, due to safety and security concerns.

* Monitor local media for breaking events and be prepared to adjust your plans.
* Avoid staying overnight outside of the main cities and tourist locations.
* Obtain comprehensive medical insurance that includes medical evacuation coverage valid for Tunisia.
* When entering or transiting through Tunisia, do not bring in Tunisian currency in any amount and avoid bringing in any foreign currency, including dollars, over TND 10,000 (about $3,000 USD).
