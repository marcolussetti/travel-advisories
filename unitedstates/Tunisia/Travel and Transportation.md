**Road Conditions and Safety:**

* Driving in Tunisia can be dangerous. Visitors should avoid driving after dark outside Tunis or major resort areas or on country roads.
* Drivers often fail to obey the rules of the road, even in the presence of police. Traffic signs and signals are often ignored, and drivers sometimes drive vehicles on the wrong side of the road or the wrong direction on a one-way street. Defensive driving is a must in Tunisia.
* Faster drivers tend to drive on the left while slower drivers stay to the right. Traffic lane markings are widely ignored. Cars that wish to pass often signal with their headlights.
* Drivers may be stopped for inspection by police officers within cities and on highways at any time, and drivers should comply.
* Bicycles, mopeds, and motorcycles are operated without sufficient lights or reflectors, making them difficult to see darting in and out of traffic. Motorists should also be aware of animals on the roads, particularly in rural areas.

**Traffic Laws:** Drivers should be aware that if they are involved in a motor vehicle accident that results in death or serious injury of another person, the police may take them into protective custody until they are absolved of responsibility. This can mean spending up to several months in detention. As with any arrest or detention, U.S. citizens taken into custody should immediately request that the police inform the Embassy of their whereabouts.

**Public Transportation:** Exercise caution when using public transportation, due to safety and security concerns. Trains, buses, and taxi minibuses (known as louages) may be overcrowded, have unsafe driving practices, poor maintenance, and increased likelihood of criminal activity.

See our [Road Safety page](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/safety/road.html) for more information.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Tunisia, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Tunisia’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/).

**Maritime Travel:** Mariners planning travel to Tunisia should also check for [U.S. maritime advisories and alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts).  Information may also be posted to the  [U.S. Coast Guard homeport website](https://homeport.uscg.mil/), and the [NGA broadcast warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings).
