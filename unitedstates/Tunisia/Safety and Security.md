# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:** Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad.  Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – and most often target police, military, and other government security forces in Tunisia.  Terrorists may also target crowds and unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

The U.S. Department of State recommends that U.S. citizens in Tunisia maintain a high level of vigilance throughout the country. U.S. citizens living and working in Tunisia should understand that they accept the risks of remaining in the country and should carefully consider those risks.  The threat of anti-Western terrorist activity persists, as does the risk of death or injury as a non-targeted bystander..

**Specific Areas to Avoid:** U.S. Embassy Tunis requires advance notification to Embassy security officials of travel by Embassy personnel outside greater Tunis.  Certain cities and governorates in Tunisia have a fluid and unpredictable security environment, and these areas require additional scrutiny before U.S. government personnel under the Embassy’s (Chief of Mission’s) security responsibility may travel to them.  U.S. citizens should not travel to the following areas due to terrorist activity:

* Within 16 km of the Algerian border, except for the cities of Tabarka and the Ain Draham.
* Within 16 km of Libyan border in southeastern Tunisia.
* The Mount Chaambi National Park, Mount Salloum, Mount Sammamma, and Mount Mghila in the Kasserine Governorate.
* The Mount Orbata area in the Gafsa governorate.
* The desert south of Remada due to the military zone.

The following groups, including ones on the U.S. government’s list of designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations, pose a high risk to U.S. citizens in the region:

* The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS)
* Al-Qa’ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM)

**Crime:**

* Travelers should remain vigilant of their surroundings and take care to secure their valuables. Prominently displayed cash or jewelry may attract unwanted attention.
* High-value items left unattended and visible have been stolen from vehicles, hotel rooms, and private residences.
* Criminals have targeted tourists and business travelers for theft, pick pocketing, and scams.
* Incidents of theft, robbery, and burglary have been reported in upscale neighborhoods during day and night. Violent crime is rare, however, an increase in incidents of harassment and assaults against women have been reported in Tunis among the expatriate community. Some of these criminal encounters occurred in dark or isolated areas surrounding commercial zones, public beaches, and parks.
* Consider reporting any crimes against U.S. citizens immediately to the local police and the U.S. Embassy.
* Report suspicious activity to the local police.

**Demonstrations:** Demonstrations may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Demonstrations are most common on Saturdays and in the month of January. Since the October 7, 2023, attack by HAMAS on Israel, there has been an increase in spontaneous demonstrations, especially on weekends in Tunis near embassies (on Avenue du Martyr Taoufik Missaoui and Avenue Habib Bourguiba) and foreign cultural centers.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Past demonstrations have turned violent.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**International Financial Scams:** Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Tunisia. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Financial scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. For more information on international financial scams, see our page on [Protecting Yourself from Scams](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/safety-resources/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes) pages.

**Technology Usage Abroad:** Mobile Devices are vulnerable to compromise, theft, and physical damage anywhere in the world. Best practices prior to traveling abroad are keeping all software (operating system and apps) updated and use virtual private network and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications if possible. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi.

GPS Navigation applications (apps) are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using the GPS app make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. GPS navigation app may give you the shortest route without safety consideration.

Be cautious of using dating apps/online dating websites abroad as U.S. citizens can be targeted by scammers. Make sure to inform your friends and family of your whereabouts, meet at a well-known public location, and do not consume suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs.

**Victims of Crime:** Victims may wish to report crimes to the local police by dialing 197 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(216) 71-107-000. Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.

U.S. Embassy Tunis can:

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is generally regulated and rules with regards to best practices and safety inspections are regularly enforced. Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities.  In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout Tunisia.  Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.

The Tunisian National Guard encourages persons traveling into the desert to register their travel beforehand. Generally, this is done through tour operators in the region.

* No special authorization is required to travel to the desert as far south as Remada.
* The desert south of Remada is designated as a military zone by the Government of Tunisia. If travelers wish to enter the military zone, for example to travel to Borma, a special authorization is required. The Department of State advises U.S. citizens against travel to this area.
* Please visit the Embassy’s [desert travel page](https://tn.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/desert-travel/?_ga=1.128351884.1618682579.1484766425).
