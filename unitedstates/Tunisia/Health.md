For emergency services in Tunisia, dial 190.

Ambulance services are:

* not widely available and training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.
* not present throughout Tunisia or are unreliable in most areas except Tunis, Sfax, Sousse, and Monastir.
* not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment.
* not always staffed with trained paramedics and often have little or no medical equipment.

**We do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas.  Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage.  Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the Tunisia [Ministry of Public Health](http://www.santetunisie.rns.tn/fr/) or the [Central Pharmacy of Tunisia](http://www.phct.com.tn/index.php/en/) to ensure the medication is legal in Tunisia.

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Air Quality:** Air pollution is a moderate problem in major cities in Tunisia. Consider the impact seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you and consult your doctor before traveling if necessary.

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas. Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in [destination]. For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/). For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/). For general health information, visit the “[Your Health Abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad.html)” page.

The U.S. Embassy maintains a list of [doctors and hospitals](https://tn.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/local-resources-of-u-s-citizens/doctors/). We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.

**Health facilities in general:**

* Adequate but below U.S. standards health facilities are available in Tunis and other major cities.
* Public medical clinics lack basic resources, supplies, staffing, and hygiene.
* Hospitals and doctors often require payment “up front” prior to service or admission. Credit card payment is not always available.  Most hospitals and medical professionals require cash payment.
* Private hospitals usually require advance payment before admitting a patient.
* Travelers should make efforts to obtain complete information on billing, pricing, and proposed medical procedures before agreeing to any medical care.
* Be aware that travelers will not receive a medical report after service unless specifically requested.
* Be aware that some hotels, resorts, etc. have exclusive agreements with medical providers, which may limit your choices in seeking emergency medical attention.
* Medical staff may speak little or no English.
* Generally, in public hospitals only minimal staff is available overnight in non-emergency wards. Consider hiring a private nurse or having family spend the night with the patient, especially a minor child.
* Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals.
* Psychological and psychiatric services are very limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions.

**Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery**

* U.S. citizens have suffered serious complications or died during or after having cosmetic or other elective surgery.
* Medical tourism is a rapidly growing industry. People seeking health care overseas should understand that medical systems operate differently from those in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations. Anyone interested in traveling for medical purposes should consult with their local physician before traveling and visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/medical-tourism) website for more information on Medical Tourism.
* Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/medical-tourism) website for information on Medical Tourism, the risks of medical tourism, and what you can do to prepare before traveling to Tunisia.
* We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/health/insurance-providers.html) to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications.
* Your legal options in case of malpractice are very limited in Tunisia.
* Although Tunisia has many elective/cosmetic surgery facilities that are on par with those found in the United States, the quality of care varies widely. If you plan to undergo surgery in Tunisia, make sure that emergency medical facilities are available, and professionals are accredited and qualified.

**Pharmaceuticals**

* Tunisia has severe shortages of medications, and not all medications available in the United States are available in Tunisia. Plan in advance before traveling.
* Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with little controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments.
* U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/buyingusingmedicinesafely/buyingmedicinefromoutsidetheunitedstates/default.htm) websites for more information.
* Check with the Tunisia [Ministry of Public Health](http://www.santetunisie.rns.tn/fr/) or the [Central Pharmacy of Tunisia](http://www.phct.com.tn/index.php/en/) to find available medications and restrictions on importing medication.

**Non-Traditional Medicine**

* U.S. citizens have suffered serious complications or died while seeking medical care from non-traditional “healers” and practitioners in Tunisia. Ensure you have access to licensed emergency medical facilities in such cases.

**Water Quality**

* In many areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested.  Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.
