The Ethiopian Immigration and Citizenship Service strictly enforces immigration regulations and expects all foreign nationals to be in the country under legal status. There is a daily fine if you overstay your visa.  This fine must be paid in full in U.S. dollars at immigration in order to obtain an exit visa and be permitted to depart the country.

**Foreign Currency Restrictions:**

Travelers must declare all foreign currency exceeding the above limits.
