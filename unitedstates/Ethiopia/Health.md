Consult the [CDC website for Ethiopia](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/ethiopia) prior to travel.

For emergency services in Ethiopia, dial the following numbers:

* Addis Ababa Police Commission Emergency: 991/922
* Fire (Addis Ababa): 939
* Traffic Police (Addis Ababa): 945
* Ambulance (Ethiopian Red Cross Society in Addis Ababa): 907

Medical care is extremely limited and health care facilities are only adequate for stabilization and emergency care. There is a shortage of physicians and other qualified medical personnel, as well as medical supplies, including, but not limited to, respirators, oxygen, and medications.  Emergency, ambulance, and psychiatric services are also limited. All care providers, both public and private, require payment or a cash deposit in Ethiopian birr before treatment is performed.

Ambulance services are not present throughout the country or are unreliable in most areas except Addis Ababa. Ambulances are also not generally staffed with trained paramedics and often have little or no medical equipment. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

**The U.S. Embassy in Addis Ababa will not pay medical bills.**  Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. Some clinics will require payment prior to service or prior to checkout.

**Medical Insurance:**  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See the Embassy webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance)for more information on the type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. It is strongly recommended that you obtain supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in its original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. If the quantity of drugs exceeds that which would be expected for personal use, a permit from the Ministry of Health is required. Check with the Ethiopian Food and Drug Administration (EFDA) at +251-11-552-41-22 or \*8484\* to ensure the medication is legal in Ethiopia.

**Altitude:**  Many cities in Ethiopia, including Addis Ababa, are at high altitude. Be aware of the symptoms of altitude sickness and take precautions before you travel.  Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about  [travel to high altitude locations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/travel-to-high-altitudes).
