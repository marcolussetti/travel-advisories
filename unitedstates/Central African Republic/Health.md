For emergency services in the Central African Republic, dial 117 (local equivalent of “911”) or 2161-2200 (the Gendarmerie.)

Ambulance services are:

* Not present throughout the country.
* Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

U.S. Embassy Bangui **does not pay medical bills for U.S. citizens.**Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance and often medical facilities in CAR require payment before treatment.

**Medical Insurance:**Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most healthcare providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on the types of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription.

Medical facilities are extremely limited in CAR, and the quality of care is unreliable. Sanitation levels are low. Many medicines are not available. You should carry a sufficient supply of properly labeled prescription drugs and other medications with you for your entire visit.
