# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

The U.S. Department of State advises against all travel to CAR. U.S. Embassy Bangui cannot provide consular services to U.S. citizens in CAR at this time. U.S. citizens in need of assistance should contact the [U.S. Embassy in Cameroon](https://cf.usembassy.gov/).

U.S. citizens should carry all proper paperwork at all times, including their passport.

**Demonstrations** occur spontaneously. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Mob violence targeting those implicated in crimes or road accidents can occur. Harassment of foreign nationals is common, as are demonstrations against international organizations and interests.

* Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent.
* Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**Armed Conflict**: There are ongoing military operations throughout CAR; armed groups remain active in large parts of the country. Outside Bangui, criminals and various armed actors frequently perpetrate violence against civilians to include foreigners and humanitarian workers; road travelers and those operating outside Bangui are especially vulnerable. Armed robberies, physical and sexual assaults, ambushes, homicides, illicit taxation and extortion, arbitrary search and seizures, unlawful detentions, and kidnappings of civilians are common. Armed actors in northwestern CAR have increasingly used landmines and other explosive devices along roads and in areas near the Cameroonian border. Outbreaks of intercommunal violence and armed conflict can happen without warning anywhere in the country including Bangui.

**Crime:**  Crime in Bangui is common.  Beware of:

* Petty theft in large market areas;
* Armed gangs in Bangui and outlying residential areas;
* Violent demonstrations, looting, burning of buildings, and roadblocks during periods of civil unrest and conflict; and
* Checkpoints staffed by armed actors seeking bribes and impeding the work of peacekeeping forces.

**Victims of Crime:** U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the [U.S. Embassy in Cameroon](https://cf.usembassy.gov/) for assistance.

Report crimes to the local police at 117 (local equivalent of “911”) or the Gendarmerie at 2161-2200 and contact the U.S. Embassy in Cameroon at +(237) 22220-1500 ext. 4341/4023. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime. Victims of crime in Bangui may have to pay to send a vehicle to pick up police officers due to the shortage of police vehicles and fuel.
