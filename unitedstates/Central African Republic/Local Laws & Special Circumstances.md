# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws and penalties. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities prior to practicing or operating a business.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:**If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy in Cameroon immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

**Identification:** Local law requires passports to be carried on your person at all times. Failure to produce your passport may result in detention and/or a fine.

**Drugs:**Penalties for possession, use, or trafficking in illegal drugs in CAR are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.

**Photography:**Taking photographs of police or military installations, airports, or any other government buildings is prohibited.  Unauthorized photography will result in the seizure of photographic equipment and detention of the photographer, by CAR authorities. Police or other government authorities can provide information and grant permission for photographing a particular subject or location. Locals in CAR may be very sensitive to all photography; you should obtain permission first.  
  
**Corruption:** Corruption remains a serious problem among CAR security forces, some members of which have harassed travelers for bribes. At night, the roads in the capital are often manned with impromptu checkpoints, at which police or soldiers ask motorists and travelers for money.    
  
**Banking:** Banking infrastructure remains limited in CAR, and facilities for monetary exchange exist only in the capital. There are few ATMs in CAR.  Exchange bureaus and banks normally accept dollars and euros, with the exception of West African Francs (CFA). Credit cards are not widely accepted in CAR, and purchases of goods and services, including hotel rooms and airline tickets, are cash transactions.

**Travelers with Disabilities:**The law in Central African Republic does not prohibit discrimination against persons with disabilities. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. Expect accessibility to be limited in transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure.
