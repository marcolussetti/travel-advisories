***Updated with additional detail about multiple risks and addition of the health indicator.***

Do not travel to the Central African Republic (CAR) due to **armed conflict**, **crime**, **civil unrest**, and **kidnapping**, as well as Embassy Banguiâ€™s limited capacity to provide support to U.S. citizens.

**Country Summary:**Although there have been no specific incidents of violence or threats targeting U.S. citizens, there is a continuing risk of civil unrest, demonstrations, and election-related violence (including renewed outbreaks of armed conflict) occurring throughout the country, including the capital of Bangui.

Violent crime, including homicide, kidnapping, armed robbery, aggravated battery, and larceny, is common.

Armed groups and opposition forces control large areas of the country, and they regularly kidnap, injure, and/or kill civilians. In the event of unrest, airport, land border crossings, and road closures may occur with little or no notice.

The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in CAR; U.S. government employees must obtain special authorization to travel outside of the capital. Family members cannot accompany U.S. government employees who work in CAR.

Access to medical care is limited. Medical facilities are limited in the quality and standard of care they can provide, and they may not have adequate supplies of basic medications. Visit our website for [Travel to High-Risk Areas](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/TraveltoHighRiskAreas.html).

Read the [Country Information Page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/CentralAfricanRepublic.html) for additional information on travel to CAR.

If you decide to travel to CAR:

* Enroll your trip in the State Department's [Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)](https://step.state.gov/step/).
* Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney.
* Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.
* Share important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones so that they can manage your affairs, if you are unable to return as planned to the United States. [Find a suggested list of such documents here](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-checklist.html/).
* Be sure to appoint one family member to serve as the point of contact with hostage-takers, media, U.S. and host country government agencies, and Members of Congress, if you are taken hostage or detained.
* Establish a proof of life protocol with your loved ones, so that if you are taken hostage, your loved ones can know specific questions (and answers) to ask the hostage-takers to be sure that you are alive (and to rule out a hoax).
* Leave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them.
* Erase any sensitive photos, comments, or other materials from your social media pages, cameras, laptops, and other electronic devices that could be considered controversial or provocative by local groups.
* Leave your expensive/sentimental belongings behind.
* While travel medical insurance is recommended for all travelers, local medical facilities are likely to require full payment in cash at the time of service and may otherwise deny care.
* Travelers to CAR should have medical evacuation insurance.
* Follow the Department of State on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/travelgov) and [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/StateDept?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor).
* Review the [Country Security Report](https://www.osac.gov/Content/Browse/Report?subContentTypes=Country%20Security%20Report) for Central African Republic.
* Prepare a contingency plan for emergency situations.
* Visit the CDC page for the latest [Travel Health Information](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list) related to your travel.
