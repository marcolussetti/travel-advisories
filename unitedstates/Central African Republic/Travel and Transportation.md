# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Road conditions are extremely poor.  Watch out for:

* Large potholes and degraded roadways
* Unpaved roads throughout CAR
* Drivers ignoring traffic laws to drive on the smoothest section of roads
* Impromptu checkpoints by armed groups and or government organizations
* National Government Curfew is in effect from 2200-0500

U.S. Embassy Bangui advises against:

* Overland travel in the northern, eastern, and western regions due to the risk of armed attacks on motorists
* Driving after dark

**Traffic Laws:** If you are involved in a traffic accident, you should wait until the police or the Gendarmerie arrive unless your health or safety is threatened. There are currently no distracted driving laws in effect in the Central African Republic, but police may pull over drivers who talk or text while driving for not following safe driving procedure.

**Public Transportation:** The city of Bangui has a public transportation system consisting of green buses and yellow taxis, though these vehicles are often dangerously overcrowded and very badly maintained.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in CAR, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of CAR’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/).
