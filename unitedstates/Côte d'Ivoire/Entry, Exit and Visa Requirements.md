Although e-visas are available at the airport upon arrival, they must be requested online prior to arrival in Côte d’Ivoire. If a U.S. citizen arrives without the proper visa, immigration may take your passport. They will return it when you go to the immigration office the next business day and pay the visa fees. You can find more information online at [Côte d’Ivoire e-visas.](https://ambaciusa.org/visa-infos.php)

An export permit issued by the National Museum is required for all high-value pieces of art being removed from Côte d'Ivoire. The export permit costs 2,000 CFA plus 500 CFA per object.

U.S. citizens who plan to live in Côte d’Ivoire must apply for a residency permit (titre de séjour) at the Office d’Identification Nationale. (Note: Titres de séjour are not issued to children under the age of 16 who are documented on their parents' visas.)

The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Côte d’Ivoire.
