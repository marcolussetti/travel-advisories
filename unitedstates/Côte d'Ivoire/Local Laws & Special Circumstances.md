# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:**U.S. citizens are subject to laws of the foreign countries they visit. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. People starting a business or practicing a licensed profession should seek information from local authorities. They should do this before starting to practice or operate a business.

Furthermore, you can be prosecuted in the United States for some acts committed overseas, even if those acts are not illegal where they happened, for example, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-ceos) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Customs:**Ivoirian customs authorities encourage the use of an ATA (Admission Temporaire/Temporary Admission) Carnet. It is for temporary admission of professional equipment, samples, and goods for exhibitions and fairs. ATA Carnet Headquarters, at the [U.S. Council for International Business,](https://uscib.org/) 1212 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036, issues and guarantees the ATA Carnet in the United States. For additional information, call (212) 354-4480 or email [ATA Carnet Headquarters](mailto:atacarnet@uscib.org). Business travelers can bring laptop computers into the country without difficulty. Traveling with desktop computers or other electronics in large numbers may cause a problem. It may look like you're bringing them into the country to resell. Travelers should show a business reason for such equipment. They can use an ATA or submit a letter to the Director General of Customs to ask for temporary admission.

If traveling to another West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) country, expatriate residents leaving Côte d’Ivoire must declare the amount of currency being taken out of the country. Residents visiting CFA Franc countries, but not WAEMU members, cannot take CFA Francs out of Côte d’Ivoire. They can carry up to 2,000,000 CFA Francs (about 4,000 USD) in other currencies. You can take funds more than that amount out of the country in the form of travelers or bank checks.

If you travel to any non-WAEMU country, tourists can't take more than 500,000 CFA Francs (about 1,000 USD). Business operators can't take more than 2,000,000 CFA Francs (about 4,000 USD) without government approval.

For more on customs rules, travelers can check the Ivoirian Customs Agency’s [website](http://www.douanes.ci/).

Corruption is a serious problem in Côte d’Ivoire. It affects judicial proceedings, contract awards, customs, and taxes. Police, military, and gendarmes routinely stop cars for traffic violations and security checks. If you are stopped, politely present your identification. Police and security officials rarely speak English. If you are stopped at one of these checkpoints and asked to pay a bribe, refuse politely. Then, present your photocopy of your U.S. passport, visa, and entry stamp.

**LGB Travelers:** There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Côte d’Ivoire. However, same-sex marriage is not recognized under local law. The laws only mention same-sex sexual activity as a form of public indecency. It carries a penalty of up to two years in prison, the same as for illegal heterosexual acts. Antidiscrimination laws exist. But, they do not cover discrimination based on sexual orientation.

See our [LGB Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgbti.html) page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports-bureau-of-democracy-human-rights-and-labor/country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** The law in Côte d’Ivoire bans discrimination against people with physical and mental disabilities. But, it is not well enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. According to the 2019 Human Rights Report, people with disabilities reportedly faced discrimination. This discrimination happened in employment and education. Prisons and detention centers provided no accommodations for persons with disabilities. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure in Abidjan and throughout the country.

* Rental, repair, and replacement parts for aids/equipment/devices are scarce. The same is true for service providers, such as sign language interpreters and personal assistants. Contact the [U.S. Embassy in Côte d’Ivoire](mailto:abjamcit@state.gov) to receive a list of providers.
