Abidjan has privately-run medical and dental facilities that are adequate, but do not fully meet U.S. standards. Good physician specialists can be found, although few speak English. While pharmacies are well-stocked with medications produced in Europe, newer drugs may not be available. If you plan a lengthy trip to Côte d’Ivoire, you should bring enough medication to last the entire stay in your carry-on luggage. Medical care outside of Abidjan is extremely limited.

For emergency services in Côte d’Ivoire, dial the numbers below.

For emergency medical transport in Côte d’Ivoire, public ambulances are free. Private ones charge a fee. Ambulances may be contacted at the numbers below:

* Public system: SAMU “Service d’aide Medicale Urgente”: +225 27-22-44-94-09, +225-27-22-44-34-45, or +225-27-22-44-53-53 (on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/SAMUPAGEOFFICIELLE))
* MEDICIS (private): +225-27-21-75-29-60 or +225-27-21-75-29-63 (on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Medicis-Assistance-150032448347942/))
* SOS Abidjan (private): 1304 (on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/SosAbidjan/))

Ambulance services in the public system are rare. Training and the availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards. Ambulance services are also not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to hire a private ambulance or take a taxi or private vehicle. They do this to reach the nearest major hospital rather than wait for a public ambulance.

**We do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-checklist.html) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more information. They have details on the insurance to get before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend [supplemental medical insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-checklist.html) to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in the original packaging. Also, carry your doctor’s prescription. Check with the [Ministry of Health & Public Hygiene](https://guce.gouv.ci/health?lang=en)to ensure the medication is legal in Côte d’Ivoire.

**Vaccinations:**Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/ivory-coast)recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Health Facilities in General:**

* Adequate health facilities are available in Abidjan and other major cities, but health care in rural areas is below U.S. standards.
* Medicine and supplies are often scarce in public health facilities. The same is true in many rural medical facilities.
* Hospitals and doctors often require payment “up front” prior to service or admission. You can't always pay by credit card. Most hospitals and doctors require cash.
* Medical staff may speak little or no English.
* Generally, in hospitals only minimal staff is available overnight. Consider hiring a private nurse or having family spend the night with the patient, especially a minor child.
* Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals.
* Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities.

**Pharmaceuticals:**

* Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and needing prescriptions in the United States, are often easy to buy with few controls. Counterfeit medication is common. It may be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients. Buy medication with a medical professional's advice. Buy it from reputable sellers.
* The rules for bringing medication back to the U.S. are set by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the [Traveling with Medication](https://help.cbp.gov/s/article/Article-1444?language=en_US) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/)websites for more information.

**Water Quality:**

* Although tap water is potable in Côte d’Ivoire, we recommend drinking only bottled water. Bottled water and drinks are safe. But, many restaurants and hotels serve tap water. They do this unless you ask for bottled water. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.

**Adventure Travel:**

* Swimming in coastal waters is dangerous and strongly discouraged, even for excellent swimmers. The ocean currents along the coast are powerful and treacherous, and numerous people drown each year.
* Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about [Adventure Travel](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/travel-to-the-extreme).

**General Health:**

The following diseases are prevalent:

* Diarrhea illness
* HIV/AIDS
* Malaria
* Meningococcal Disease
* Tuberculosis
* Yellow Fever
* Dengue

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend mosquito repellents. They also recommend sleeping under insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets. Chemoprophylaxis is recommended for all travelers even for short stays.

**HIV/AIDS:**Data from UNAIDS Spectrum Estimates in February 2023 shows that Côte d’Ivoire has an HIV prevalence rate of 1.8 percent for 15- to 64-year-olds. The rates are higher for female sex workers, and men who have sex with men: 23.6 percent, 18.54 percent, and 13.33 percent. Annually, there are approximately 7,700 new HIV infections (300 among children) and 10,300 AIDS-related deaths in Côte d’Ivoire.

**Air Quality**

* Air pollution is a significant problem in several major cities in Côte d’Ivoire. Consider the impact of seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution on you. Consult with your doctor before traveling if needed.
* The air quality varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons. It is worst during the harmattan season. This is a very dry time in West Africa when winds blow sand and dust from the Sahara Desert. It lasts from December to February. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include:
  + Infants, children, and teens.
  + People over 65 years of age.
  + People with lung disease, such as asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). COPD includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema.
  + People with heart disease or diabetes.
  + People who work or are active outdoors.

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.
