# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:** Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are using simpler methods to attack. These include knives, firearms, and vehicles. They use them to target crowds more effectively. Frequently, their aim is focused on unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.).
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists.
* Places of worship.
* Schools.
* Parks.
* Beaches.
* Shopping malls and markets.
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights).

Côte d’Ivoire still faces threats from violent extremist groups in the region. These groups are active across the borders of Burkina Faso and Mali. Côte d’Ivoire is not a base for these groups. Violent extremist groups in the region have stated they will target foreigners and/or countries that participate in counterterrorism efforts. For more information, see our [Terrorism](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html) page.

Crime is common. Property crime includes burglaries and car theft. Violent crime includes carjacking, armed robberies of homes and streets. Illegal firearms are readily available throughout the country. Banditry and other violent crimes continue. They happen day and night in the countryside. During holidays (including major Muslim and Christian holidays), robberies and opportunistic crimes increase. These crimes include burglaries of cars and homes. Criminals seldom harm victims of street crime if they comply with demands. Assailants have used violence if victims refuse to hand over valuables.

Law enforcement is somewhat effective at deterring crime but lacks adequate resources. Security services often lack radios, guns, and cars. This severely limits their ability to respond. Many gendarmes and police stations outside of Abidjan have one vehicle for the whole precinct. They often get distress calls from the public via cell phone because they lack a centralized dispatch system. Responses to incidents of crime are often slow and generally limited to writing a report. The legal system lacks resources and tools to handle its current cases, and cannot jail criminals according to global standards.

U.S. citizens should be careful when visiting the Abobo, Adjame, Angre, Koumassi, Marcory, and Yopougon districts in Abidjan. They should also be careful in popular night areas, including Plateau, Treichville, and Zone 4.

Always carry identification to minimize the risk of harassment at police checkpoints.

Uniformed police, military, and gendarmes routinely stop vehicles. They do so for traffic violations and security checks. If you find yourself at such a stop, politely present your identification. Police and security officials rarely speak English. Incidents of police or security force harassment or detention of foreigners are rare but do occur. If an officer asks you to pay a bribe, politely refuse and present a photocopy of your U.S. passport, visa, and entry stamp.

There are weapons are left over from the civil war. They are a security threat. Criminals, rogue soldiers, and groups with common political views can exploit them. They pose an ongoing risk to Côte d’Ivoire’s fragile democracy.

**Demonstrations** occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

* Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent.
* Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

Election-related violence is another concern. The next presidential election is planned for 2025. Riots and demonstrations have occurred around elections. They have sometimes resulted in deaths. They may continue due to ongoing political tensions.

**International Financial Scams:** See the [Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes) pages for information on scams.

Internet romance and financial scams are increasingly prevalent in Côte d’Ivoire. Scams often start with Internet postings or profiles. They can also start with unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include:

* Romance/online dating
* Money transfers
* Lucrative sales
* Gold purchase
* Contracts with promises of large commissions
* Grandparent/relative targeting
* Free trip/luggage
* Lotteries
* Inheritance notices
* Work permits/job offers
* Bank overpayments

Piracy, armed robbery, and kidnapping for ransom pose big threats to U.S. ships in the Gulf of Guinea. They also threaten U.S. mariners on a ship or traveling to or from one in the Gulf of Guinea. Pirates target a variety of vessels, and it is not uncommon for them to fire upon vessels during boardings and attempted boardings. Please find the latest U.S. Maritime Advisory [here](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci/2023-001-gulf-guinea-piracyarmed-robberykidnapping-ransom).

**Weather Safety:** The rainy season is from June to September. It often includes heavy rains and flash flooding. This is especially true in low-lying areas. Heavy rains have caused landslides, riverbank erosion, bridge washouts, and property damage. Roads may be closed suddenly and stay closed for indefinite periods of time, especially in more remote areas. U.S. citizens should watch local weather and news reports. They should avoid driving through flooded areas. And, they should keep water and emergency supplies at home.
