**We do not pay medical bills.**Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas.

**Medical Insurance:**Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more [information on insurance providers for overseas coverage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/health/insurance-providers.html).

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/health/insurance-providers.html) to cover medical evacuation.

Medical facilities are extremely limited, especially outside of Bamako. U.S.-standard care does not exist. Most U.S. medicines are unavailable; European medications are more easily found and can be obtained at pharmacies throughout Bamako.

* Do not purchase the potentially dangerous counterfeit or expired medications sold on the local market.
* Carry with you an adequate supply of needed medication and prescription drugs, along with copies of the prescriptions, including the generic names for the drugs.
* If traveling with prescription medication, always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription.

Your doctor can help you decide which medicine is right for you, and also talk to you about other steps you can take to prevent malaria. See the [CDC website](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2020/preparing-international-travelers/yellow-fever-vaccine-and-malaria-prophylaxis-information-by-country/mali) for more detailed information about malaria in Mali.

**Air Quality:** Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas. Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in [destination]. For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/). For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).
