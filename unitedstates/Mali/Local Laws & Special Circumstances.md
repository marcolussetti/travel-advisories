# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be arrested, expelled, or imprisoned. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. Travelers may be detained for questioning if stopped by the police and unable to produce their passport or for taking pictures of certain buildings. Driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol may lead to arrest. If you break local laws, your U.S. passport will not help you avoid arrest or prosecution. The U.S. government cannot get you out of jail.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Mali.html#ExternalPopup) website.

**Arrest Notification:**If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

**Cultural Property:**Mali is a signatory to the Treaty on Cultural Property, which restricts exportation of Malian archeological objects, in particular those from the Niger River Valley. Visitors seeking to export any such property are required by Malian law to obtain an export authorization from the National Museum in Bamako. Contact the [Embassy of Mali](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Mali.html#ExternalPopup) in Washington D.C. or the nearest Malian consulate for specific information regarding customs requirements. U.S. Customs and Border Protection may impose corresponding import restrictions in accordance with the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act.

**Currency/Access to Funds:** Currency exchange facilities are slow and often use out-of-date exchange rates. There are several ATMs in Bamako that accept U.S. credit/debit cards, though they do not always function reliably. There are some ATMs outside of Bamako in Segou, Sikasso, Koutiala, Gao, and Mopti, though they are occasionally inoperable. Credit cards are accepted at the larger hotels, Banque Atlantique, a few travel agencies (for an extra fee), some grocery stores, and upscale restaurants. Cash advances from credit cards are available in Mali via Western Union. The U.S. Embassy is unable to provide currency exchange services for private U.S. citizens.

**Photography:** Exercise caution when taking photographs in Mali. Photographing any official object, entity, or person is restricted. These restrictions include infrastructure, facilities, government buildings, and individuals. You should obtain explicit permission from the Malian government before photographing transportation facilities and government buildings. Taking a photograph without permission in any public area or around any of the above listed facilities often provokes a prompt response from security personnel or offends the people being photographed. Taking photos of the U.S. Embassy in Bamako is also prohibited.

**Communication:** Communication infrastructure in Mali is of limited coverage, especially outside of major cities, but there is cellular phone coverage in Bamako. International telephone calls are expensive. Internet service providers offer service in many areas of Bamako, and fiberoptic service is available for a price.

**Faith-Based Travelers:**See our following webpages for details:

**LGB Travelers:**There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Mali. Societal discrimination, however, is widespread. LGB individuals have experienced physical, psychological, and sexual violence, which society views as corrective punishment and police frequently refuse to intervene. Most LGB individuals isolate themselves and keep their sexual identity hidden.

Seeour [LGB Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgb.html)page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports/2018-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details.

**Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:**There is no law protecting the rights of persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, or mental disabilities in employment, education, access to health care, or in the provision of other state services, nor requiring accommodation and access to public facilities. No special accommodations or officially reduced fares or rates are available to persons with disabilities in public transportation or taxis, communications, lodging, medical facilities, restaurants, cafés, bars or other tourist spots. Foot paths and pedestrian-friendly road crossings are rare and generally inaccessible to persons with disabilities.

**Students:** See our [Students Abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/studentsabroad/en.html) page and [FBI travel tips](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Mali.html#ExternalPopup).

**Women Travelers:** Domestic violence, including spousal abuse, is common. Although the law prohibits spousal abuse, it does not prohibit domestic violence. The minimum age to marry without parental consent is 16 for females and 18 for males. Girls may marry with parental consent at age 15 if a civil judge approves. However, child marriage remains a common practice.

Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) is legal in Mali and widely practiced. The Government of Mali prohibits FGM/C in government-funded health care centers.
