# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Crime:** The volume of crimes against persons and property, to include homicides, is high throughout Uruguay. Street crime, including armed robberies, theft and carjackings occur in tourist centers within Montevideo with large numbers of tourists, such as Ciudad Vieja, the Rambla, and the neighborhood around the U.S. Embassy. Even upscale residential neighborhoods, such as Punta Carretas, Pocitos, and Carrasco are not immune to criminal activity. Maintain situational awareness and practice good personal security at all times while traveling throughout Uruguay as criminals typically seek out victims in vulnerable situations.

Thefts, burglaries, armed robberies, assaults, and other violent crimes are common throughout Uruguay. Criminals tend to conduct surveillance on potential targets including ATMs, residences, restaurants, vehicles, and individuals prior to committing robberies. Criminals regularly travel in pairs on motorcycles to approach unsuspecting victims with a weapon and demand personal belongings before fleeing. They attempt to catch victims off-guard by driving slowly next to their vehicles and waiting for them to get out of their car to rob them. Other times, they break car windows to steal valuables from vehicles that are parked or stuck in traffic.

Be vigilant when using ATMs, especially during non-daylight hours. Criminals frequently use gas-induced explosive devices to steal from ATMs.

The following Montevideo neighborhoods have higher crime rates, and official U.S. government personnel are recommended to avoid or limit travel to these areas:

* 40 Semanas
* Bella Italia
* Borro
* Casavalle
* Casabó
* Cerro
* Cerro Norte
* Hipódromo
* La Teja
* Marconi
* Malvín Norte
* Tres Ombúes
* Villa Española

During the summer months (December-March), many cities in Uruguay experience an increase of petty street crime, residential burglaries, and robberies, especially in beach towns such as Punta del Este, La Barra, La Paloma, Cabo Polonio, La Pedrera, and Punta del Diablo. Criminals also target vehicles traveling to these and other popular destinations.

Police cars are clearly marked and equipped with cellular phones. While professional and well-trained, local police do not maintain a robust physical presence to deter criminal activity throughout Montevideo, which often results in a delayed response. Most police officers do not speak English.

**Demonstrations:** Demonstrations, some expressing anti-U.S. sentiment, regularly occur in Uruguay, particularly near the Legislative Palace, City Hall, Parque Batlle, Plaza Libertad, and the universities in Montevideo. Protests directed toward the U.S. government, usually small in size, can occur around the U.S. Embassy. U.S. citizens visiting or residing in Uruguay should avoid large gatherings or events where crowds congregate to demonstrate, protest, or cause damage as a byproduct of celebrating an event, such as after soccer matches.

**Victims of Crime:** Report crimes to the local police at 911 and contact the U.S. Embassy at (598) 1770-2000 or [MontevideoACS@state.gov](mailto:MontevideoACS@state.gov). Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment.
