[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** While in Uruguay you are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are [arrested or detained](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html), ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Customs Requirements:** Uruguay's Customs authorities may enforce strict regulations concerning temporary importation or exportation of certain items. These include precious jewels, gold, firearms, pornography, inflammable articles, acids, prohibited drugs, plants, seeds, and foodstuffs as well as antiquities and business equipment. Uruguayan Customs also prohibits the importation of subversive materials aimed at overthrowing the government or promoting anarchy, genocide, or other globally condemned practices. Contact the [Embassy of Uruguay](https://embassyofuruguay.us/) in Washington, D.C., or one of Uruguay's consulates in the United States for specific information regarding customs requirements.

Tourists are permitted to import personal effects, including jewelry, cameras, computers, sporting goods, etc., free of duty or taxes. Travelers bringing commercial goods into Uruguay must declare them to customs officers at the port of entry or face possible detention or seizure of the goods and criminal charges. Please see our [customs webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/customs-and-import.html) for more information.

**Marijuana Policy:** Recent changes in legislation allow Uruguayan citizens and permanent residents of Uruguay to purchase limited amounts of marijuana at government-approved pharmacies, join a registered marijuana club, or grow a limited amount of marijuana for personal use. Please note it remains illegal for tourists and other foreign visitors in Uruguay to purchase and consume marijuana. Anyone who purchases or consumes marijuana, and who does not fit into a legal category of use, may be arrested and prosecuted under Uruguayan law.

See our [LGB Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgbti.html) page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports-bureau-of-democracy-human-rights-and-labor/country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details.

**Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:** Uruguayan law prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities, but the government does not effectively enforce these provisions. Transportation services are generally not equipped for access by persons with disabilities. Sidewalks and crosswalks are often in need of maintenance and/or accessibility ramps and can present challenges to persons with disabilities.
