Medical care facilities in Uruguay are considered adequate and most are comparable to U.S. standards. The responsiveness of emergency, personal ambulance service is generally within U.S. standards; however there may be service delays if questions about health insurance coverage arise. Ambulances are staffed with a medical doctor, enabling advanced treatment/care en route to the local hospital.

The U.S. Government does not pay medical bills, and U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas. Serious medical problems requiring hospitalization and/or medical evacuation to the United States can cost tens of thousands of dollars.

Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Travelers on cruise ships with stops in Uruguay are strongly urged to verify their overseas health insurance coverage. Most health care providers in Uruguay accept cash and credit card payments. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance overseas. We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

Carry prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription. There is no restriction on types of medication that can be imported for personal use. Some medications may not be available in Uruguay, so bring a sufficient supply for your stay.

While rare, the Uruguayan summer can bring about an increase in diarrheal illness and mosquito-borne diseases, so the use of insect repellent is advisable.

Vaccinations: Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/routine-vaccines) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There are no special vaccination requirements for Uruguay.

Air Quality: Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas. Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in [destination]. For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/).
