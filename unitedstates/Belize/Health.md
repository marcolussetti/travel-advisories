Emergency services will be either unavailable or significantly delayed. Serious injuries or illnesses normally require evacuation to another country.

Medical care for minor ailments is generally available in urban areas. Advanced medical treatment is very limited in Belize City or Belmopan and is extremely limited or unavailable in rural and remote areas. Pharmacy services are generally acceptable in larger cities. Specialized prescription medications may be completely unavailable. If you bring your own prescription medications, you must carry a current doctor’s prescription for each medication. Please contact the Belize Customs Department at (501) 223-7092 or via e-mail at [cusnet@btl.net](mailto:cusnet@btl.net) for more information.

**We do not pay medical bills.**Be aware that U.S. Medicare and Veteran’s Administration health benefits do not apply overseas.

Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on overseas insurance.

**We strongly recommend**[**supplemental insurance**](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html)**to cover medical evacuation.**

Carry prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.

**Zika Virus**: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identifies Belize as a Zika risk area. The [Zika virus](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/zika-travel-information) is spread by the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito. These mosquitoes bite during the day and night. Zika can be passed from a pregnant woman to her fetus. Infection during pregnancy can cause certain birth defects.
