Emergency services are usually unavailable or significantly delayed. Serious injuries or illnesses normally require evacuation to another country.

Medical care for minor ailments is generally available in urban areas. Advanced medical treatment is scarce in Belize City and Belmopan. In rural and remote areas, even basic medical care is hard to find or not available at all. Pharmacy services are generally acceptable in larger cities. Specialized prescription medications may be completely unavailable. Bring your own prescription medications, and carry a current doctor’s prescription for each one. Please contact the Belize Customs Department at (501) 223-7092 or via e-mail at [cusnet@btl.net](mailto:cusnet@btl.net) for more information.

**Ambulance services are:**

* not widely available and training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.
* not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment.

**The Department of State, U.S. embassies and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. Review our [Insurance Overseas page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html?cq_ck=1708701048867) for more information on insurance providers with overseas coverage. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Travel Insurance page](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on the type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

**We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.**

Carry prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.

**Carbon Monoxide**

Many hotels and other lodgings are not equipped with carbon monoxide detectors, even if they contain sources of this potentially lethal gas. U.S. citizens have died from carbon monoxide poisoning in Belize. If your lodging is not equipped with a carbon monoxide detector, consider traveling with a portable one.

**Adventure Travel**

Participation in adventure sports and activities may not be covered by accident insurance, and safety protections and regulations for these activities may differ from U.S. standards. Visit [our website](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/adventure-travel.html) and [the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/belize) for more information about adventure travel.

**Zika Virus**: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identifies Belize as a Zika risk area. The [Zika virus](https://www.cdc.gov/zika/geo/index.html) is spread by the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito. These mosquitoes bite during the day and night. Zika can be passed from a pregnant woman to her fetus. Infection during pregnancy can cause certain birth defects.
