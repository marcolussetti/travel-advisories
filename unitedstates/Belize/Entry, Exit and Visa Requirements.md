# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

You must have a U.S. passport valid for the length of your stay, proof of an onward or return ticket, and sufficient funds to cover the cost of the length of stay. If you enter Belize by land, you will be charged different fees depending on whether your stay is less than or more than 24 hours. Belize doesn’t require special immunizations for visitors. You can find recommended vaccinations from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at [Belize vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/belize?s_cid=ncezid-dgmq-travel-single-001).

Tourists for less than 30 days do not require a visa. Visitors who plan to stay longer than 30 days need to get their passport re-stamped at a local immigration office. They must also pay an extra fee for each additional month they want to stay. This can be done for a maximum of six months. Visitors for longer than six months might need to show extra documents to the local immigration office. Longer visits will likely require more fees. Visit the [Embassy of Belize to the United States website](https://www.belizeembassyusa.mfa.gov.bz/) for the most current visa information.

**Traveling with Minors:** When children travel without both parents, immigration officials are required to ask for proof of consent and identification from the non-traveling parent, as well as birth certificates from the children. Documented proof of consent can include notarized letters from the parent(s), a custody decree, adoption papers, or death certificates if one or both parents have passed away.

**HIV/AIDS Restrictions:** The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Belize. Please verify this information with the [Embassy of Belize](https://www.belizeembassyusa.mfa.gov.bz/) before you travel.
