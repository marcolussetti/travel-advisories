**Reissued after periodic review with minor edits.**Exercise increased caution in Belize due to**crime**. Some areas have increased risk. Please read the entire Travel Advisory.

**Country Summary**: Violent crime – such as sexual assault, home invasions, armed robberies, and murder – are common even during the day and in tourist areas. A significant portion of violent crime is gang related. Due to high crime, travelers are advised to exercise caution while traveling to the south side of Belize City. Local police lack the resources and training to respond effectively to serious crimes. Most crimes remain unresolved and unprosecuted.

**Belize City – Level 3: Reconsider Travel**

U.S. citizens should avoid traveling to Belize City. Historically much of the violent crime in Belize occurs in the Southside of Belize City and is gang related. This area (south of Haulover Creek Canal and continuing south to Fabers Road) does not overlap with the typical tourism areas. All visitors should maintain an elevated level of situational awareness, exercise increased caution, and practice good safety and security practices.
