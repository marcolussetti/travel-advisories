# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

Belize is rated high for crime and has one of the highest per capita murder rates in the world. Gang members and other criminals use violent means to resolve disputes. Visitors should exercise caution throughout Belize, particularly in the south side of Belize City and remote areas along Belize’s borders due to high crime.

**Crime:** Crime may occur anywhere in Belize, and criminals frequently target tourists, including those at resorts and on the roads and river ways. Crime, including sexual assault, armed robbery, and murder remains high and is distributed evenly throughout the country. Sexual harassment and/or assault of persons traveling alone or in small groups have been reported.

Most crimes remain unresolved and unprosecuted. A lack of capacity, resources, and training impedes the ability of local police to effectively investigate crime and apprehend offenders.

Thefts of cash and credit cards happen frequently in some areas of Belize. It is believed several credit card fraud rings are currently active in Belize, particularly in San Pedro.

Scams occur in Belize, especially in resort areas. Tourists, in general, are particularly vulnerable to these crimes, resulting in visitors being pick-pocketed, robbed and/or extorted. See the [Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html)and the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/) pages for information on scams.

**Victims of Crime:** Report crimes to the local police by dialing 911 and contact the U.S. Embassy at 822-4011. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes. While the Embassy stands ready to assist the Belize authorities with any requests for technical assistance, the Embassy is not a law enforcement agency, cannot provide U.S. citizens with protection or investigate crimes against U.S. citizens, and has no jurisdiction to intervene in police or judicial processes. See our webpage on [help for U.S. victims of crime overseas](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/victims.html).

**Tourism:**The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities may not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unavailable outside of major cities to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).
