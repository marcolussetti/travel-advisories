# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

Belize has a high crime rate and has one of the highest per capita murder rates in the world. Gang members and other criminals use violent means to resolve disputes. Visitors should be careful in Belize. This is especially true in the south side of Belize City and in some remote border areas.

**Crime:** Crime can happen anywhere in Belize. Tourists are sometimes targeted, especially at resorts and along roads and rivers. Crime is high across the country. This includes sexual assault, armed robbery, and murder. Sexual harassment and/or assault of persons traveling alone or in small groups have been reported. Historically, much of the violent crime in Belize occurs in the Southside of Belize City and is gang related.

Most crimes remain unresolved and unprosecuted. Local police struggle to investigate crime and catch offenders.

Thefts of cash and credit cards happen frequently in some areas of Belize. It is believed several credit card fraud rings are currently active in Belize, particularly in San Pedro.

Tourists are particularly vulnerable to being pick-pocketed, robbed and/or extorted.

**Scams:** Scams occur in Belize, especially in resort areas. Real estate investment scams in Belize have been reported with tactics including false promises of amenities and misleading sales tactics. If you are considering purchasing real estate in Belize, we recommend you seek legal and financial advice from a reputable source before making any decisions.

Review the Department of State’s [Protecting Yourself from Scams](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/) pages for information on scams.

**Technology Usage Abroad:** Mobile devices can be compromised, stolen, or damaged anywhere in the world. Before traveling abroad, it is best to keep all software (operating system and apps) updated. If possible, use a virtual private network (VPN) and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi.

GPS Navigation Apps are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using the GPS app make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. GPS navigation apps may give you the shortest route without safety considerations.

**Victims of Crime:** Report crimes to the local police by dialing 911 and contacting the U.S. Embassy at +501 822-4011. Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes. While the Embassy stands ready to assist the Belize authorities with any requests for technical assistance, the Embassy is not a law enforcement agency, cannot provide U.S. citizens with protection or investigate crimes against U.S. citizens, and has no jurisdiction to intervene in police or judicial processes. See our webpage on [help for U.S. victims of crime overseas](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/victims.html).

**Domestic Violence:**U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the [U.S. Embassy in Belize](https://bz.usembassy.gov/) for assistance.

**Tourism:**The tourism industry has inconsistent regulations and enforcement. Safety checks for equipment and facilities can be unreliable and sporadically performed. Hazardous areas and activities may lack proper signage. Also, staff may not be trained or certified by the host government or recognized authorities. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders may not be available outside major cities for urgent medical care.
