# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) website.

**Arrest Notification:**If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://bz.usembassy.gov/contact/) for further information.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries. They may be illegal according to local laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety. You may be subject to fines and/or have to give up counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States. Review the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/trade/fakegoodsrealdangers#:~:text=It%20is%20illegal%20to%20purchase%20counterfeit%20goods.%20Bringing,activities%2C%20such%20as%20forced%20labor%20or%20human%20trafficking.) website and [U.S. Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-ccips) website for more information.

**Lesbian and Gay Travelers:** There are no legal restrictions on consensual same-sex relations, the provision of information or services to persons on the basis of real or perceived sexual orientation, or the organization of events focused on sexual orientation. While the Immigration Act prohibits “homosexual” persons from entering the country, immigration authorities have not enforced that law.

There continues to be significant hostile sentiment towards individuals based on their real or perceived sexual orientation. Tourist friendly areas, including San Pedro Town on Ambergris Caye, remain relatively open and welcoming. Outside of these areas, same-sex couples, especially men, are reluctant to display affection in public (including holding hands) because incidents of verbal or physical assault have been reported. There have been some instances of violence targeting persons on the basis of real or perceived sexual orientation reported, and human rights organizations have indicated that the police at times refused to accept reports of crime targeting persons on the basis of sexual orientation.

Seeour [Lesbian and Gay Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgb.html) page and section 6 of our [Human Rights Report](https://www.state.gov/reports-bureau-of-democracy-human-rights-and-labor/country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities**: The law doesn’t ban discrimination against people with physical, sensory, intellectual, or mental disabilities. The law does not provide for accessibility to persons with disabilities. Most public and private buildings and transportation are not accessible.
