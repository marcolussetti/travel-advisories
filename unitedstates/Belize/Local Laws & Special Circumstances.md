# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) website.

**Arrest Notification:**If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://bz.usembassy.gov/contact/) for further information.

**Faith-Based Travelers:**See the [Department of State’s International Religious Freedom Report](https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/).

**LGB Travelers:** The Belizean government in September 2016 conceded the decriminalization of homosexuality, but is questioning a section of a July 2016 Supreme Court ruling that made “sexual orientation” a protected class. The Immigration Act prohibits “homosexual” persons from entering the country, but immigration authorities have not enforced that law.

There continues to be significant hostile sentiment towards individuals who identify themselves as LGB. Tourist friendly areas, including San Pedro Town, Ambergris Caye, remain relatively open and welcoming to the LGB community. Outside of these areas, LGB persons, especially males, are reluctant to display affection in public (including holding hands) because incidents of verbal or physical assault have been reported. There have been some instances of violence reported against LGB individuals, and LGB groups have reported that the police at times refused to accept reports of crime from LGB persons.

Seeour [LGB Travel Information](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/lgbt.html)page and section 6 of the [Department of State's Human Rights report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Persons with Mobility Issues**: While in Belize, individuals with disabilities will find accessibility and accommodation very different from in the United States. The law does not expressly prohibit discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, and mental disabilities in employment, education, air or other transportation, access to health care, or the provision of other state services. The law does not provide for accessibility to persons with disabilities. Most public and private buildings and transportation are not accessible.

**Students:**See our [Students Abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/studentsabroad/en.html) page and [FBI travel tips](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/student-travel-brochure-pdf.pdf/view).

**Women Travelers:**Women traveling alone or in small groups are targets for sexual assault, even in tourist areas. See our travel tips for [Women Travelers](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/Women.html).
