# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Road conditions in Belize range from two-lane paved roads to dirt or gravel tracks. Many roads lack markings, reflectors, and shoulders, which can contribute to road traffic accidents. Many urban streets do not have lane markings, which can make driving confusing. Bridges on some major highways can be reduced to a single lane, sometimes without warning. **Driving at night is strongly discouraged.**

Roadside assistance is frequently unavailable. There are rarely public phones available, and emergency numbers don’t always work. Cell phone service is mostly reliable, but reception can be unreliable in remote areas.

**Traffic Laws:** Drivers operate vehicles on the right side of the road. Valid U.S. or international driver’s permits are accepted in Belize only for a period of three months after initial entry.

If you are involved in a traffic accident, contact the local police and explain the emergency. If you or someone with you is critically injured, go to the nearest hospital. If there are no injuries or risk of life, wait for the police to arrive. If possible, take pictures before any vehicles are moved. Do not move the vehicles or leave the scene if there are no injuries. If you hit someone on the road, stop and give assistance; contact the local police and report the accident.

Bicycles are numerous and constitute a regular part of traffic. Cyclists, like drivers, do not always obey basic traffic laws. They commonly fail to obey red lights or stop signs and often ride against traffic. Cyclists and pedestrians often do not have any reflectors or bright clothing and can be difficult to spot.

Please refer to our [Road Safety](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/driving-and-road-safety.html) page for more information.

**Public Transportation:** Taxis are prevalent in cities but not as common in rural areas. Taxis are identified by green license plates. Most visitors will need to call a taxi service to summon a taxi. Buses are used to travel between cities and are not common for short commutes. Uber and Lyft are not available in Belize. Secondhand and/or salvage vehicles and buses are often used for public transportation and may not have security features such as seatbelts and airbags. We suggest that you visit the [Belize Tourism Bureau website.](https://www.belizetourismboard.org/)

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed Belize’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with international standards for aviation safety oversight. FAA’s [website](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa) includes more information on its assessment program.

**Maritime Transportation:** Mariners and passengers planning travel to Belize should check for U.S. [Maritime Advisories and Alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories). Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard Homeport](https://mmcvqr.uscg.mil/missions) website, and the [NGA Navigational Warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings)website.
