# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

**Illegal Drugs:** U.S. citizens should only carry items they personally purchase and pack. Penalties for possession, use, or trafficking in illegal drugs are strict, pre-trial detention can last for years, heavy fines are leveraged, and final sentences are lengthy.

**Changing Currency and Credit Card Use:** Credit cards are accepted in limited locations. Counterfeit U.S. currency is prevalent in Guyana. U.S. citizens should only exchange currency with banks, hotels or licensed money exchange houses.

**Firearms:**  Do not enter Guyana with firearms or ammunition without prior express consent from the Guyana Police Force. Visit the [Guyana Police Force](https://guyanapoliceforce.gy/)’s and [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/) website for more information.

**Wildlife:** An export permit is required by the [Ministry of Agriculture](https://agriculture.gov.gy/) to take an exotic animal or plant out of Guyana, and an import permit is required by the [U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service](https://www.fws.gov/) to bring an exotic animal or plant into the United States.

**LGB Travelers:** Consensual same-sex sexual relations between men are criminalized in Guyana. It is not uncommon for local police to use the law to intimidate men known or perceived to be gay. There are no laws concerning same-sex sexual relations between women. There is no legal protection from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation under Guyanese law. Seeour [LGB Travel Information](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/lgbt.html)page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Women Travelers:** See our travel tips for [Women Travelers](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/Women.html).

**Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:** Guyanese law prohibits discrimination against disadvantaged persons and persons with disabilities. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. Access to buildings, pedestrian paths, and transportation is difficult for persons with mobility issues. Sidewalks are often unevenly paved. Buses and taxis do not have special accommodations. Newer buildings/ buildings in the city are more likely to have ramps, reserved parking, and accomodating sanitary facilities.
