The Government of Guyana requires all non-Guyana citizens ages 18 and over entering the country to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19.

The quality of medical care in Guyana remains low and inconsistent. Emergency care and hospitalization for major medical illnesses or surgery are limited due to lack of trained specialists and poor sanitation.

The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas and activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. Almost 80 percent of Guyana’s territory is covered by forest, beyond the area of paved roads. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in or near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide medical treatment.

Purchase medical evacuation insurance in advance of travel. See our webpage for more [information on insurance providers for overseas coverage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/health/insurance-providers.html).

For emergency services in Guyana, dial 913.

**Health facilities in general**

Hospitals and doctors often require payment “up front” or proof of insurance prior to service or admission. Most hospitals and medical professionals require cash payment.  Psychological and psychiatric services are limited.

**Ambulance Services**

Are not widely available, especially in remote parts of the country. Training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards. Ambulance services are not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment and are not staffed with trained paramedics and/or often have little or no medical equipment. Injured or seriously ill travelers are often taken to nearest hospital by taxi or private vehicle.

**Medical Insurance**

Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

**Prescriptions**

If traveling with prescription medication, check with the government of Guyana to ensure the medication is legal in Guyana. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription.

**Vaccinations**

Be up to date on all [vaccinations](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

In many areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe.

**Air Quality**

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.

* Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in Guyana.
