# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Crime:** Criminal activity, including murder and armed robbery, is common in Guyana.

Exercise increased situational awareness in certain areas of Georgetown due to increased reports of robberies, sexual assaults and homicides. The neighborhoods of Agricola, Tiger Bay and Albouystown as well as Stabroek Market should be avoided at all times. During the day, exercise increased situational awareness at the National Park, Seawall and Bourda Market. At night, avoid the seawall east of Vlissengen Road, the National Park, and Bourda Market. Avoid walking in Georgetown after dark.

**Sexual Assault:** Verbal sexual harassment is common and usually takes the form of catcalling and using lewd and sexually suggestive language to describe women’s dress and appearance. This can occur anywhere groups of men congregate, for instance, bars, seawalls, construction sites, bus and car parks, and market areas. Reports of rape have increased within past year. Most victims knew their attacker. U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence should call the domestic and sexual violence hotline, 914, and contact the Embassy.

**Domestic Violence:**  Domestic violence, especially against women, is common in Guyana. Some police stations may have a domestic violence unit; however, not all police officers are trained to handle these cases. U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence should call the domestic and sexual violence hotline, 914, and contact the Embassy.

**Border Dispute:**  The ongoing dispute about the western border between Guyana and Venezuela has reportedly resulted in assaults, robberies, extortion, and murders in towns on both sides of the border. Fishing villages and mining camps are the most victimized. The Guyanese military and law enforcement lack the capacity to adequately face the challenges in this region.
