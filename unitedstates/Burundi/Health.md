[#### Health](javascript:void(0); "Health")

Health facilities throughout the country are well below the U.S. standard of care. Training of staff and general hygiene and sanitation remain a problem. Adequate health facilities for basic medical care are available in Bujumbura and at some other locations. If you do need medical care, you will be asked to pay cash in advance and may be denied treatment if unable to do so. Credit cards are generally not accepted; insurance companies are not billed.

There is no single number for emergency medical services in Burundi. Contact [a doctor or hospital](https://bi.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/doctors/) directly.

Ambulance services are:

* Not present throughout the country or are unreliable.
* Not staffed with trained paramedics and often have little or no medical equipment.

Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

**The U.S. Government does not pay private medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/health/insurance-providers.html) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on the type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/health/insurance-providers.html) for medical evacuations.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the [Burundi Ministry of Public Health](https://cousp-minisante.gov.bi/) to ensure the medication is legal in Burundi.

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Air Quality:**Air pollution is a moderate problem in several major cities in Burundi. Consider the impact seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you and consult your doctor before traveling, if appropriate. Respiratory issues have been reported more frequently when the air quality is worse, particularly in the drier months. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include:

* Infants, children, and teens.
* People over 65 years of age.
* People with lung disease, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema.
* People with heart disease or diabetes.
* People who work or are active outdoors.

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas. Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in [destination]. For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/). For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).

**Health facilities in general**

* Adequate health facilities for basic care are available in Bujumbura, but health care throughout the country is below U.S. standards. Public medical clinics often lack basic resources and supplies.
* Hospitals and doctors often require cash payment up front, prior to service or admission. Credit card payment is not available.
* Medical staff may speak little or no English.
* In general, minimal staffing is available overnight in non-emergency hospital wards. Consider having family spend the night with patients, especially a minor child.
* Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals.
* Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities.

**Pharmaceuticals**

* Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over-the-counter and those requiring prescriptions in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with little controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments.
* U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/buyingusingmedicinesafely/buyingmedicinefromoutsidetheunitedstates/default.htm) websites for more information.
* Please contact the [Burundi Ministry of Public Health](https://cousp-minisante.gov.bi/) for regulations on bringing medication into Burundi.

**Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy**

* If you are considering traveling to Burundi to have a child through use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) or surrogacy, please see our [ART and Surrogacy Abroad page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Assisted-Reproductive-Technology-ART-Surrogacy-Abroad.html).
* There are no known cases of surrogacy in Burundi. According to current guidance from civil authorities, if a child were born through surrogacy in Burundi, the surrogate mother would be listed as the birth mother on the birth certificate. She could then decide whether to give the child up for adoption.

**Water Quality**

* Tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe. Be aware that ice for drinks may be from tap water.

HIV/AIDS: HIV transmission within Burundi is lower in comparison to other countries in sub–Saharan Africa; however, the risk of transmission remains higher than in the United States. Visitors should exercise caution and avoid unprotected sexual activity.
