# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:** National highways vary in condition from good to very poor. Large potholes are common. During the main rainy season from February to May, many roads become impassable. Flooding and landslides also destroy bridges and block routes. Many roads in the interior of the country are in disrepair. U.S. Embassy personnel are prohibited from driving outside of Bujumbura before 05:00 and after 18:30. There is a general lack of:

* Lighting
* Traffic signals
* Road signs
* Road shoulders

The above conditions make driving dangerous, particularly outside of cities and at night. Poor driving standards and pedestrians, cyclists, and livestock on the roads create further hazards. There have also been recent incidents of pedestrians struck and killed by minibuses. Exercise extra caution while walking on or alongside a road.

Motorists in Burundi should be careful to keep their doors locked and windows closed when driving around the capital. Fuel shortages are common, leading to very long lines at service stations that can last for hours or days. Outside Bujumbura, service stations are scarce, and fuel is often unavailable. Professional roadside assistance is limited outside the capital. Carry with you:

* Spare tires
* Food and water
* Methods of communication
* Maps and navigation equipment
* A first aid kit

**Traffic Laws:** An international driving permit and third-party insurance is required. Long-term residents can apply for a Burundi driver’s license. Use of cell phones while driving is illegal. Give buses and taxis a wide berth as they start and stop abruptly, often without pulling to the side of the road. Many passenger doors on buses open on the side facing the road and passengers may emerge into traffic.

There are many right-hand drive vehicles in Burundi, although Burundi is a left-hand drive country.

In the case of an accident, call and attempt to have police respond. If a hostile crowd forms or you feel your safety is in danger, leave the scene and proceed to the nearest police station to report the incident. Do not stop at the scene of an accident you see or come upon.

**Public Transportation:** Public transit is unregulated, unreliable, and generally unsafe due to overloading, reckless driving, inadequate vehicle maintenance, and the risk of petty crime. Hire private transportation from a reliable source. U.S. Embassy personnel are prohibited from using public transportation, including taxis, taxi-motos, taxi-bikes and buses. Fatal collisions occur frequently. Due to security concerns, the bus depots near the former Central Market are also off-limits to U.S. Embassy personnel.

If you use a taxi, negotiate the fare before beginning your journey. Taxis are not metered, so confirm the fare with your hotel or before entering a taxi.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Burundi, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Burundi’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards.
