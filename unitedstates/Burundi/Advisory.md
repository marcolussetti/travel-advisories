***Updated to reflect the end of ordered departure of eligible family members and authorized departure for non-emergency employees and updates to U.S. government employee movement restrictions.***

Reconsider travel to Burundi due to **political violence, crime,** and **health**. Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.

**Do Not Travel to**:

* The former Central Market located on Chaussee Prince Louis Rwagasore in Bujumbura due to the risk of **violent** **crime**.
* Cibitoke and Bubanza provinces and Kibira National Park due to potential **armed violence**.

**Country Summary:** The possibility for political violence exists throughout Burundi. Police and military checkpoints are common and can limit movement. Police may search private homes for weapons. The borders may close without notice.

Violent crimes like assault, carjacking, home invasion, grenade attacks, and armed robbery are possible. Criminals may target foreigners and residents suspected of having large sums of cash. Local police lack the resources and training to respond effectively to crimes.

Medical services in Burundi fall well below U.S. standards, and there are no adequate trauma services in the country. Emergency medical and fire services are limited or non-existent in some areas of the country. Even relatively minor health problems may necessitate a medical evacuation at the traveler’s expense. Medical evacuation insurance valid for travel to Burundi is strongly recommended.

Due to the risks, the U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens throughout Burundi. U.S. Embassy staff are subject to restrictions when traveling in certain areas of Burundi and may be subject to other constraints as security conditions warrant. U.S. government employees working in Burundi are prohibited from travelling outside Bujumbura Mairie during hours of darkness (typically 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.).

Due to the risks, the U.S. government may be unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in the following areas:

* The provinces of Bubanza.
* Cibitoke and Kibira National Park (including the park’s southernmost part in Muramvya province).

* Consider traveling in pairs and using convoys of multiple vehicles to mitigate the risks related to traveling outside of Bujumbura. Carry additional fuel, spare tires, and provisions. Include a map, navigation equipment, and first aid kit. Service stations are scarce in rural areas. Professional roadside assistance service is not available outside the capital.
