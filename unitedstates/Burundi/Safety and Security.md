# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

See the Department of State’s [Travel Advisory for Burundi](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Burundi.html).

Incidents of violence occur.

* Grenades and small arms have been used in some acts of violence in Burundi.
* Armed groups opposed to the Burundian government operate in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and have in the past launched attacks inside Burundian territory. DRC armed forces and UN peacekeepers continue to conduct combat operations against rebels, militia, and ISIS-aligned groups in Eastern DRC. As a result, Cibitoke and Bubanza provinces, and the portion of Bujumbura Rural province that borders DRC, are vulnerable to armed violence.
* Armed actors may also exploit porous borders and forested areas between Burundi and Rwanda and the DRC for illicit activities. U.S. Embassy personnel follow increased security protocols when visiting the following areas: the provinces of Bubanza and Cibitoke, and Kibira National Park (including the park’s southernmost part in Muramvya province), even when just transiting through the park to reach Kayanza via RN-10.

**Searches:** Security forces routinely search vehicles and homes, including those of foreigners and U.S. citizens. Residential searches are routine and generally occur between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m.; police must present identification and a warrant. Report improper searches to the U.S. Embassy.

**Roadblocks:** Police maintain checkpoints throughout the country. Travelers have reported harassment, bribe solicitations, intimidation, and (though rare) physical violence, especially during heightened security situations. If stopped:

* Be compliant, calm, and courteous.
* Identify yourself as a U.S. citizen.
* Remain in your vehicle.
* Provide copies of identification documents if requested and attempt to keep originals. It is common practice for police to retain personal or vehicle identification documents in return for a ticket to ensure payment. Documents are returned following payment of the fine at Emmaus Pathway on Blvd Mwanbutsa or at other approved locations.
* Do not drive away until instructed to do so.
* Report harassment to the U.S. Embassy.

**Crime:** Crimes of opportunity (mainly for financial gain) are the most reported incidents of crime against U.S. citizens in Burundi. In recent years, there have been two incidents of violent crime against U.S. citizens. Most criminal incidents involve theft, burglary, and robbery. Petty crime may be more likely in public places. Criminal elements do not typically single out U.S. citizens, but may view them as targets of opportunity based on perceived affluence or vulnerability. U.S. citizens should take these precautions:

* Keep doors and windows closed and locked (at home and in vehicles).
* If threatened, particularly by an armed assailant, do not refuse or resist—your life is worth more than your belongings.
* Prior to your departure, tell someone where you are going and when you expect to be back.
* Avoid being out alone late at night.
* Exercise caution when carrying and/or displaying possessions, especially valuable ones.

**Demonstrations** occur occasionally. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**Precautions:**

* Carry original and color photocopies of your U.S. passport and visa at all times.
* Avoid large public gatherings. Even events intended to be peaceful can turn violent.
* Be vigilant against petty crime.
* Monitor news and [consular alerts](https://bi.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/security-and-travel-information/).
