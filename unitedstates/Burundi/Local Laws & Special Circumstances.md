# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws, regardless of your nationality. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be arrested, expelled, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities prior to practicing or operating a business.

Convictions for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs are severe and result in long jail sentences and heavy fines.

If stopped by the police, you are expected to produce an acceptable form of identification.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

**Power Outages:** Power outages occur frequently and may affect public services such as access to potable water.

**Photography:** It is illegal to take pictures of government buildings, military installations, and key infrastructure such as airports and border controls, including via a drone. You could be detained or arrested, fined, and have your equipment confiscated. Do not take photos of Burundians without their permission.

**Phone Service:** Cell phones are used extensively. SIM cards can be purchased locally and used with a compatible cell phone. You must present a copy of your ID and/or passport to register your SIM card.

**Currency:** The Burundian franc (BIF) is the official currency although U.S. currency may be required in certain cases. Most transactions are conducted in cash. Credit cards are rarely accepted outside of a few upmarket hotels and restaurants in Bujumbura. Most vendor and banking institutions will take only U.S. bills in near-mint condition, printed after 2009. Examine U.S. bills to ensure they are legitimate.

Be aware that hotels will require payment in U.S. dollars from foreigners not resident in Burundi.

Exchange currency only at reputable banks. ATMs are available at the international airport and in Bujumbura, but they dispense only Burundian francs. The U.S. Embassy does not exchange currency for U.S. citizens.

**Faith-Based Travelers:** See the following webpages for details:

**LGB Travelers:** Burundian law criminalizes consensual same-sex relations with penalties ranging from fines to imprisonment of three months to two years, but prosecutions are rare. People have, however, been detained based on their perceived sexual orientation. There were also reports that members of the LGB community were threatened, beaten, and arrested by local administrators and other citizens with the support of security forces.

Seeour [LGB Travel Information](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/lgbt.html) page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** The law in Burundi prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual or mental disabilities, but the law is rarely enforced. Some groups report that discrimination is prevalent. Expect accessibility to be limited in transportation, lodging, and public buildings with few sidewalks and no curb cuts. Most buildings lack functioning elevators.

**Students:** See our [Students Abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/studentsabroad/en.html) page and [FBI travel tips](https://ucr.fbi.gov/investigate/counterintelligence/student-brochure).

**Women Travelers:** Sexual and domestic violence, including rape, is a widespread problem. Center Seruka and Center Nturengaho provide shelter and counseling to survivors of rape and domestic violence. Several international NGOs provide free medical care for survivors, mostly in urban areas. U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance.
