**COVID-19 Requirements**

There are no COVID-related entry requirements for U.S. citizens.

**Traveling Through Europe**: If you are planning to visit or travel through European countries, you should be familiar with the requirements of the Schengen Agreement.

* Your passport should be valid for at least three months beyond the period of stay.
* If you plan on transiting a Schengen country, review our [U.S. Travelers in Europe page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/US_Travelers_in_Europes_Schengen_Area.html).
* You will need sufficient proof of funds and a return plane ticket.

Dutch immigration authorities do not recognize the 12-page U.S. emergency passport, issued by U.S. embassies and consulates overseas, as a valid travel document for visa-free entry into the Netherlands.  If traveling on this emergency passport, please be aware that you will be refused entry by immigration officials and/or held at the airport until a return flight to the United States is available.  We strongly urge U.S. citizens in possession of the 12-page U.S. emergency passport to replace it with a full-validity passport before traveling to the Netherlands by air.

The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of the Netherlands.
