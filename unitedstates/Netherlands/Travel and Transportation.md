# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:**

* Lanes in the center of many urban two-way streets are reserved for buses, trams, and taxis.
* In cities, pedestrians should be mindful of trams and buses, which often cross or share bicycle and pedestrian paths. Serious and sometimes fatal accidents involving pedestrians or bicyclists colliding with trams and buses occur each year.
* Motorists should be especially mindful of the fact that bicyclists have the right-of-way; motorists must yield to bicyclists.
* Pedestrians should not walk along bicycle paths, which are often next to the sidewalk and usually designated by red pavement.

**Traffic Laws:**

* A valid driver’s license issued by a Department of Motor Vehicles in the United States is valid for use in the Netherlands while in tourist or visitor status. Please check [here](https://www.rdw.nl/particulier/voertuigen/auto/het-rijbewijs/buitenlands-rijbewijs/rijden-met-een-buitenlands-rijbewijs?utm_source=intern&utm_campaign=redirect&utm_medium=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rdw.nl%2Fparticulier%2Fvoertuigen%2Fauto%2Fhet-rijbewijs%2Frijden-met-een-buitenlands-rijbewijs) (Dutch only) for more information.
* You must use seat belts and child seats.
* Driving is on the right side of the road, as in the United States.
* Speed limits are strictly enforced by radar. Traffic cameras are common throughout the Netherlands, and it is possible to receive a ticket for traveling even 2-5 km/h over the limit. Different limits may apply to certain hours of the day, as posted.
* Drivers must yield the right-of-way to vehicles and bicyclists coming from the right at intersections or traffic circles unless otherwise posted.
* The maximum allowable blood-alcohol content in the Netherlands is 0.05 percent.
* The maximum allowable blood-alcohol limit for those who have had a driver’s license for less than five years is 0.02 percent.
* Use of cellular telephones for talking or texting while driving without the use of a hands-free device is prohibited and is punishable by significant fines.
* Bicyclists and pedestrians should be particularly cautious during the winter months, when paths, roads, and especially bridges can become icy and extremely slippery.

**Public Transportation:**

Rail is often a convenient alternative to driving, particularly in the areas around Amsterdam, The Hague, and Rotterdam, where road congestion is frequent. Rail network information is available at [http://www.ns.nl/en](https://www.ns.nl/en). It is relatively safe to travel by rail from city to city, compared to some other European countries but be aware of pickpockets. Taxi service in the Netherlands is safe but expensive. Trams and buses are both convenient and economical but are often frequented by pickpockets.

Please refer to our [Road Safety](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/driving-and-road-safety.html) page for more information. Also, we suggest that you visit the [Netherlands Board of Tourism and Conventions](https://www.holland.com/global/tourism.htm).

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of the Netherlands’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of the Netherland’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa).

**Maritime Travel:**

Mariners planning travel to the Netherlands should also check for U.S. maritime [advisories](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories) and [alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts). Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard homeport website](https://homeport.uscg.mil/), and the [NGA broadcast warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings).
