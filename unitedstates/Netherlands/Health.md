**COVID-19 Testing**

For information about COVID-19 testing in the Netherlands, visit the [Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport webpage](https://www.rivm.nl/en/coronavirus-covid-19/testing).

**COVID-19 Vaccines**

The COVID-19 vaccine is available for U.S. citizens to receive in the Netherlands if they are residents.  Visit the [Dutch government’s COVID-19 page](https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/dutch-vaccination-programme) for more information about obtaining the COVID-19 vaccine in the Netherlands. Visit the FDA's website to [learn more about FDA-approved vaccines](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-vaccines) in the United States.

Good medical facilities are widely available in the Netherlands. Pharmacies (“Apotheek”) are widely available and can assist with emergency prescription needs. Some common medications are not available in the Netherlands without a prescription, and some prescription drugs cannot be imported into the country.

For emergency services in the Netherlands, dial 112.

**We do not pay medical bills**

Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance**

Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on overseas coverage.

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

Carry an adequate supply of prescription drugs in their original container in your carry-on luggage. Carry a letter from your pharmacist or medical doctor with you, as some drugs are subject to confiscation by local customs agents.  Check with the [government of the Netherlands](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Netherlands.html#ExternalPopup) to ensure the medication is legal in the Netherlands. If you are traveling with any pre-existing medical conditions, bring a letter from your physician that describes your medical condition and any prescription medications, including the generic name of any prescribed drugs.

**Vaccinations**

Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Air Quality**

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.

* Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in The Netherlands.
* For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/).
