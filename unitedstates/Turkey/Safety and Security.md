# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:**The potential for terrorist attacks in Turkey, including against U.S. citizens and interests, remains high.

* Terrorists have previously attacked U.S. interests in Turkey, including the U.S. Embassy in Ankara, the U.S. Consulate General in Istanbul, and the U.S. Consulate in Adana.
* Terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Turkey. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, local government facilities, hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, parks, major sporting and cultural events, educational institutions, airports, and other public areas. Terrorists have also previously targeted Western tourists and expatriates.

Under laws passed in 2018, Turkish security forces have an expanded legal ability to stop and search individuals and to **detain individuals without charge.**

For your own safety:

* Carry a passport or identity document at all times.
* Follow local news sources during your stay to remain abreast of any potential areas, dates, or times of concern.
* Exercise caution and good judgment, keep a low profile, and maintain a high level of vigilance.
* Avoid demonstrations, which may become violent and unpredictable.
* Obey the instructions of Turkish security personnel at all times.

There have also been threats and acts of violence targeting religious minorities, groups, institutions, and places of worship in Turkey. The level of anti-Israeli and anti-Semitic sentiment remains significant.

**Protests and gatherings:** Public gatherings are common in Turkey and can include protests or demonstrations, holiday celebrations, family events, sporting events, and political events in the lead up to elections and following the announcement of election results. U.S. citizens should

* Avoid demonstrations and gatherings, as they may become violent and unpredictable.
* Be aware celebratory gunfire is common in some areas and has resulted in deaths in recent years.
* Follow local authorities instructions, police may take action to disperse the group, including possibly using teargas or detaining participants, even when the government has approved gatherings.

**Crime:** Overall street crime in Turkey is low; however, you should use the same precautions you would take in the United States. The following types of crime have been reported in Turkey:

* **Pick-pocketing**, **purse snatching**, and **mugging.** Carry only necessary items when in tourist areas.
* **Residential crime** occurs more often in major cities, with criminals targeting ground floor apartments for theft.
* **Sexual assault** has occurred in Turkish baths (*hamams*) or spas, in taxis, and when traveling alone at night. Assaults involving **date rape drugs** have also been reported.
* **Confidence schemes** occur where travelers are tricked into ordering food or drinks at a restaurant, and then are charged incredibly high prices. Patronize well-established restaurants and ask to see a menu with prices before ordering anything.
* **Scams** are common in Turkey, particularly internet scams involving people who met online. Typically, the person in Turkey asks the other person to wire large sums of money to provide financial assistance. **Do not send money to someone you have never met in person.** Exercise due diligence when purchasing jewelry, rugs, or real estate. See the [Department of State](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html) and the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-fraud-schemes) pages for information on scams.

**Eastern and Southeastern Turkey: We strongly recommend that U.S. citizens reconsider travel to specific areas in eastern and southeastern Turkey, and do not travel to areas near the Syrian or Iraqi borders.**

**U.S. Government employees are subject to travel restrictions** to the provinces of Batman, Bingol, Bitlis, Diyarbakir, Gaziantep, Hakkari, Hatay, Kilis, Mardin, Sanliurfa, Siirt, Sirnak, Tunceli and Van. **Mount Ararat**, in Agri province, is a special military zone, and **access permission must be obtained before coming to Turkey** from a Turkish Embassy or Consulate.

The following incidents and activities have taken place in **eastern and** **southeastern Turkey**:

* **Terrorist attacks:** Terrorist groups, including Da’esh, also referred to as The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) or The Islamic State of Iraq and ash Sham (ISIS), and the PKK (the Kurdistan Workers’ Party), have conducted large-scale attacks in the area, including suicide bombings, ambushes, and the detonation of car bombs, improvised explosive devices, and other homemade weapons. The PKK has attacked Turkish military and police personnel in the eastern and southeastern provinces, occasionally harming bystanders.
* **Restricted access:** Turkish security forces control access to the southeastern provinces of Hakkari, Mardin and Sirnak along the Iraqi border, and the entire Turkey-Syria border. **Do not photograph or video Turkish military operations or attempt to enter military installations anywhere in Turkey.**
* **Shootings:** Turkish towns located along the border with Syria have been struck by bullets and artillery rounds that originate in Syria, some resulting in deaths or injuries.
* **Roadblocks:** Use commercial air travel whenever possible while traveling to southeastern Turkey. **If road travel is necessary, drive only during daylight hours and on major highways.**The Turkish *Jandarma* (rural police) monitors checkpoints on roads. Cooperate if stopped at a checkpoint. Be prepared to provide identification and vehicle registration. Remain calm, do not make any sudden movements, and obey all instructions. **We strongly discourage the use of public transportation in the southeastern region.**
* **Demonstrations:** Violent clashes have taken place between Kurdish groups and Turkish police resulting from organized demonstrations.
* **Curfews:** The Turkish Government has instituted temporary curfews in cities throughout the southeast due to blockades of certain neighborhoods by the PKK. Adhere to any locally imposed curfews.

**Victims of Crime:** Report crimes to the local police by dialing 155 and contact the U.S. Embassy or nearest consulate. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.

**Tourism:**The tourism industry is generally regulated and rules with regard to best practices and safety inspections are regularly enforced. Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance.
