**Road Conditions and Safety:**Roads in Turkey range from single-lane country roads to modern, divided motorways. Highways in the tourist-frequented western, southwestern, and coastal regions of Turkey are generally in good condition and are well maintained, while conditions in other areas vary.

**Be extremely cautious while driving at night.** Driving after dark, especially in rural areas, requires extra caution due to dangers such as livestock on the road or narrow unmarked or unpaved roads.

In case of an **accident** or **car trouble**:

* Pull to the side of the road, turn on hazard lights, and use reflector triangles.
* For accidents with only vehicular damage, exchange insurance information, take photos of the accident before moving the vehicles, and depart if both sides agree. Turkish law requires drivers to fill out a Turkish-only form and provide pictures of the damage. Non-Turkish speakers should call and wait for the police.
* **For accidents with injury** or a disagreement, remain at the site of the accident. **Do not move the vehicle** – even out of the way – until the Traffic Police arrive. Report the accident to the Traffic Police (dial 155) or Jandarma (dial 156). Get a certified copy of the official report from the Traffic Police office (this can take several days).
* The owner of the damaged vehicle should also apply to the customs authority with his passport and accident report before attempting to repair the vehicle or leave the country without the vehicle.
* **When in doubt, it is best to call the Traffic Police or the Jandarma in the event of an accident.**

**Traffic Laws:**Drive defensively at all times. Drivers routinely ignore traffic regulations, including driving through red lights and stop signs, and turning left from the far right lane. These and other similar driving practices cause frequent traffic accidents.

* Penalties for **driving drunk** (blood alcohol levels at or above 0.05 percent) include a **fine** and the individual’s license being confiscated for **six months**.
* Using cell phones while driving is **illegal**and can lead to a **fine**.

Driver’s license requirements include:

* **For stays up to 180 days**: A valid U.S. driver’s license or an International Driving Permit and a U.S. driver’s license is acceptable.
* **For stays longer than 180 days**: Obtain a Turkish driver’s license from the Turkish Security Directorate, Traffic Department (Emniyet Müdürlüğü, Trafik Hizmetleri Başkanlığı).
* A vehicle can be brought into Turkey for up to six months. Find information at the Turkish Touring and Automobile Club.

**Public Transportation:**Major cities inTurkey have extensive public transportation options including taxis, subways, ferries, trains, buses and mini-buses. Licensed cabs are metered. Between cities, Turkey has bus routes, train, and air services.
