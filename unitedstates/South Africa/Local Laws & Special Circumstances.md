# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:**If you break local laws, even if you don't know, you can be deported, arrested, or put in prison. If you want to start a business or do a job that needs special permission, you should ask the local authorities for information before you start.

Some crimes can also be punished in the United States, even if they are not against local law.For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116).

**Arrest Notification:**If you are arrested or held, ask police or prison officials to notify the nearest U.S. Consulate in South Africa immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries and may be illegal according to the local laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety. You may be subject to fines and/or have to give up counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States. See the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection website](https://www.cbp.gov/trade/fakegoodsrealdangers#:~:text=It%20is%20illegal%20to%20purchase%20counterfeit%20goods.%20Bringing,activities%2C%20such%20as%20forced%20labor%20or%20human%20trafficking.) and [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-ccips) for more information.

**LGB Travelers:**There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in South Africa.

Seeour [LGB Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgbti.html) page and section 6 of our [Human Rights Report](https://www.state.gov/reports-bureau-of-democracy-human-rights-and-labor/country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:**South Africa law mandates access to buildings for persons with disabilities, but these laws are rarely enforced. Some tourist attractions, and restaurants near tourist attractions, are equipped with ramps and other options to facilitate access. Conditions vary significantly across the country.

The law in South Africa prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual and mental disabilities, and the law is enforced unevenly. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is as prevalent as in the United States. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure.
