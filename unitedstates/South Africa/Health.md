**Emergency numbers  
Dial 10111** for medical emergencies.

**Ambulance Services**

* Ambulances are scarce or unreliable in most areas, except in major cities, and lack advanced medical equipment.
* Ambulances and emergency crews often lack training.
* In an emergency, travelers may prefer to take a taxi or car to the hospital rather than an ambulance.

We highly recommend that all travelers review the  [U.S. CDC’s Health Advice for Travelers to South Africa.](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/south-africa)

**Healthcare**

* Private healthcare facilities are adequate in cities.
* Health care in rural areas may be below U.S. standards.
* Private hospitals may require a deposit before admitting patients.
* Pharmacies are well-stocked, but you should carry enough prescription medications in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.
* HIV/AIDS is a major public health concern.
* Public medical clinics lack basic resources and supplies.

**Medical payments and insurance**

* The U.S. government, including Department of State, U.S. embassies and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills.
* U.S. Medicare and Medicaid don’t work abroad.
* Make sure your insurance plan works overseas. The CDC provides more information on types of insurance available.
* Some hospitals and doctors abroad don’t accept U.S. health insurance.
* Hospitals and doctors often require payment “up front” prior to service or admission.
* Credit card payment is not always available. Many care providers overseas only accept cash.

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html?cq_ck=1708701048867) to cover medical evacuation.

* Be careful when purchasing medication overseas.
* Counterfeit medications are common and may not work or be dangerous.
* Purchase medication in consultation with a medical professional and from trusted places.
* You must follow the law if you are bringing medication back to the United States. The medication must be for personal use and approved in the United States. Get more information from [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/)

**Medical tourism and elective surgery**Learn about the risks of [medical tourism](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/medical-tourism) from the CDC and find out how to prepare before traveling.
