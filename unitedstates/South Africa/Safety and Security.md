**Civil unrest and demonstrations**   
Demonstrations happen often and are unpredictable. They often occur at or very near the U.S. embassy and consulates.

Strikes and demonstrations can include:

* Burning of vehicles, buildings, or tires – which may serve as roadblocks.
* Throwing of rocks or other objects.
* Physical attacks.
* Interruptions of traffic and the supply of electricity, water, public transportation, fuel, and other goods and services.
* Periodic incidents of mob violence against refugees and immigrants from other African countries.
* Violent attacks against strike breakers or those perceived as such (during labor protests).
* Violent protests involving taxis and ridesharing services.

**Safety tips:**Avoid demonstrations and stay alert while traveling in the country.

* Exercise caution in tourist areas.
* Check local news and alerts.

**Crime**   
Crime rates in South Africa are very high:

* Violent crimes happen in places where people live, work, travel, or go out.
* Crime can happen anywhere and at any time, even in and around Kruger National Park.
* This includes armed home invasions by criminal groups, which lead to assaults, rapes, and murders.
* Popular tourist spots and big hotels have their own security, but incidents still occur.
* Visitors and residents have been victims of armed robbery, rape, kidnapping, carjacking, mugging, and "smash-and-grab" thefts from vehicles.
* Car theft and hijacking are common, particularly in large cities.
* U.S. government staff and visitors have been robbed near diplomatic facilities.
* Theft can be bold and in broad daylight. Travelers and U.S. diplomats report cell phones being stolen from their hands. Also, thieves take purses and wallets from store counters while paying.
* Crime victims have also been followed from OR Tambo Airport in Johannesburg and then robbed when they reach their home or hotel.

**How to stay safe**U.S. citizens must always be aware of their surroundings:

* Use extreme caution at traffic lights and on or off ramps where cars slow down or stop.
* Consider getting your purchases delivered to your home or hotel (for a fee) to avoid the risk of being robbed outside high-end stores.
* Stay alert in the central business districts (CBDs) of major cities, especially after dark.
* Choose secure parking options and double check locked doors before leaving a parked car.
* Keep a low profile.
* Vary your daily routes and times.

**Stay informed while traveling:**

* Monitor local news and events.
* Messages are issued from the U.S. Embassy through the [Smart Traveler Enrollment Program](https://mytravel.state.gov/s/step) (STEP). [Register](https://mytravel.state.gov/s/step) to receive alerts while traveling abroad.
* Regularly monitor travel information from the [U.S Embassy in South Africa.](https://za.usembassy.gov/)

**Victims of crime**   
Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes. **Dial 10111** to report crimes to the local police.

* **Dial 012-431-4000** tocontact the U.S. Embassy Pretoria.

U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault or domestic violence may report crimes to the local police at 10111.

U.S. citizens victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. embassy for assistance.

The U.S. Department of State provides information on [help for U.S. victims of crime overseas](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/victims.html).

We can:

* Help you find appropriate medical care.
* Help you report a crime to the police.
* Contact family or friends with your written consent.
* Provide a list of local attorneys (does not imply support).
* Inform you of [victim’s compensation programs in the U.S.](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/victims.html)
* Issue an emergency loan for repatriation to the U.S. or limited medical support in cases of destitution.
* Replace a stolen or lost passport.

**Personal safety**Throughout South Africa, U.S. citizens should:

* Avoid walking alone, especially after dark.
* Avoid displaying cash and valuables.
* Avoid vehicles transporting cash on the road, as well as at ATMs. Criminal gangs often target these vehicles. They ambush them with automatic weapons and explosives. Criminals frequently use remote jamming and signal interceptors with success.
* Drive with doors locked and windows closed.
* Always carry a copy of your U.S. passport and visa (if applicable). Keep original documents in a secure location.
* Avoid driving during load shedding (temporary power outages). The roads can become very congested with no traffic signals. Slow-moving traffic provides opportunities for “smash and grab” theft.
* Avoid driving outside of metropolitan areas at night, due to road hazards such as animals, broken down vehicles, and the potential to become a victim of crime.
* Avoid visiting informal settlements (townships) unless you go with someone who knows the area. U.S. mission staff must use fully armored vehicles when visiting many townships in and around Cape Town. The visiting hours are 07:00-15:00.
* If you're traveling by land to a nearby country, check the local news. Delays or closures at border crossings can happen without warning.

**Student groups**Student groups have been robbed while doing outreach and community service in townships, despite coordinating with officials.

**International scams**Internet romance and financial scams are common in South Africa. Follow the Department of State [guidelines to protect yourself from scams](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html)and learn how the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) can help.

**How to avoid scammers**Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to. Rather than offering help, refer them to the closest U.S. embassy or consulate so we can work with local authorities to assist them.

If using dating apps or websites:

Let your friends and family know where you are, meet in a popular public place, and avoid eating or drinking anything suspicious.

* Set up a video call in the initial stages.
* Do a reverse image search on the profile picture.
* Don't go to bars or nightclubs alone.

Look for red flags such as:

* People who say they live in a remote location.
* Profiles that were recently created or seem to be too good to be true.
* Receiving unwanted emails or letters.
* The pace of the relationship is moving too quickly.
* Requests for money.

Common scams include:

* Romance or online dating
* Money transfers
* Lucrative sales
* Gold purchase
* Contracts with promises of large commissions
* Grandparent or relative targeting
* Free trip or luggage
* Lotteries
* Inheritance notices
* Work permits or job offers
* Bank overpayments

**Technology use abroad**Mobile devices are vulnerable to compromise, theft, and damage anywhere in the world. Follow these safety practices:

* Update all software (operating system and apps) before leaving.
* Use reputable, U.S. based VPN/VoIP applications.
* Don’t connect to unknown public Wi-Fi networks.
* Be cautious using dating apps abroad, as scammers often target U.S. citizens.

**GPS apps**Prior to using any GPS apps:

* Research the route to make sure it’s safe.
* The shortest path may not be the safest.

**Credit cards and ATMs**

* Do not hand over your credit card to vendors. They will bring a credit card reader to you.
* ATM and credit card skimming are common. Check for unusual devices on card readers and monitor your account statements.
* Skimmers have been found on machines at parking kiosks, shopping malls and office buildings. To avoid this risk, pay parking fees with cash.
* Thieves may pretend to help you use a "broken” ATM and steal your cards.

Review the [FBI pages](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/scams-and-safety/common-frauds-and-scams) for information.

**Terrorism threat**[Terrorist groups](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html?) and their supporters aim to attack U.S. citizens abroad with methods such as knives, firearms and vehicles.

Terrorists target crowds at:

* Large public events (sports, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebrations)
* Popular hotels, clubs, and restaurants
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation (subways, buses, trains, and commercial flights)

Extremists connected to international terrorist groups (al-Qai’ida, al-Shabaab, and ISIS) have used South Africa as a base to recruit new members and get financial support:

* There has been more ISIS activity in the area, including setting up devices that can start fires and carrying out kidnappings for ransom.
* South African authorities have regularly arrested terrorists.
* The U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control has publicly named ISIS members in South Africa. They have provided technical, financial, or material support to the group.

**Game parks and outdoor safety**

* Wild animals have injured and killed tourists.
* Follow all the park rules and instructions from guides.
* It’s dangerous to leave your vehicle in game parks outside of marked areas.
* Watch out for sharks when you’re swimming.
* Rip tides are common and very dangerous. Do not swim alone in remote areas or dive into unfamiliar waters.
* Hikers must be ready for quick weather changes and have the right clothing and supplies.

**Tourism**Tourism activities are generally regulated.

* Authorities usually enforce rules and safety inspections.
* Dangerous areas are well-marked with signs.
* Professional staff usually assist with activities.
* Appropriate medical treatment is widely available for injuries.

U.S. citizens should consider buying medical evacuation insurance. Learn more about [insurance for overseas travel.](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html)

**Blackouts (load shedding)**The country often experiences scheduled blackouts called “load shedding.”

* These blackouts protect the electrical grid. But they can leave areas without power for up to 6 hours daily.
* This is tough for businesses, like hotels, that lack other electrical power sources.
* Load shedding stops traffic lights from working. This leads to traffic jams and crime.
* It can also affect access to water, cell service, fuel, and safety features in rural areas.

**Weather and Natural Disasters**

**Brush fires (December-February)**

* Western Cape province, and other areas, experience brush fires during the summer. These fires can burn for several days.
* Check local media and follow fire crew instructions about road closures and evacuations.

**Drought**

* Parts of South Africa may face drought and water shortage.
* Rainfall patterns may be unpredictable.
* Water supplies in some areas may be affected. Water use restrictions may be in effect in the affected towns.

**U.S Citizens living abroad**If you live abroad for a long time, you or your family may experience various [life events](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/while-abroad.html).

* Learn how to prepare for life events like [voting](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/while-abroad/voting.html), getting [married](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/while-abroad/marriage-abroad.html), or the [birth of a child](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/while-abroad/birth-abroad.html).
* Ensure you have a plan for [healthcare or insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/while-abroad/your-health-abroad.html) abroad
* Even abroad, you still have [certain obligations](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/while-abroad/federal-benefits-and-obligations-abroad.html) such as paying your U.S. taxes or registering for military selective service.
