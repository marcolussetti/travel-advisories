# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Alerts regarding important safety and security information such as demonstrations, road security, and weather events are posted on the**[**Embassy’s website**](https://za.usembassy.gov/)**.**

**In South Africa the equivalent to the “911” emergency line is 10111.**

The following paragraphs provide a summary, but please read the Department of State’s most recent Overseas Security Advisory Council [Country Security Report](https://www.osac.gov/Pages/ContentReports.aspx?cid=2) on South Africa, which provides detailed information about safety and security concerns for travelers to South Africa.

**Civil Unrest:**Strikes and demonstrations occur frequently. These can develop quickly without prior notification and occasionally turn violent, and may include the burning of vehicles, buildings, or tires – which may serve as roadblocks; throwing rocks or other objects; or physical attacks. Strikes and demonstrations can also interrupt traffic and the provision of electricity, water, public transportation, fuel, and other goods and services. Periodic incidents of mob violence directed against refugees and immigrants from other African countries occur in South Africa. During labor protests, strike breakers or those perceived to be strike breakers have been violently attacked. Protests involving taxis and ride hailing services can turn violent. See Travel and Transportation section below for guidance.

**Precautions:**

* Avoid demonstrations and use vigilance during your movements around the country. Even events intended to be peaceful can become violent.
* Maintain caution in areas frequented by foreigners.
* Monitor news and[Alerts](https://za.usembassy.gov/category/alert/).

**Crime:**Crime in South Africa is very high. Violent crimes happen in places where people live, work, travel, or go out. This includes armed home invasions by criminal groups, which lead to assaults, rapes, and murder. Popular tourist spots and big hotels have their own security to prevent these incidents. But visitors and residents are still affected by armed robbery, rape, kidnapping, carjacking, mugging, and "smash-and-grab" attacks on vehicles. It's important to be extra careful at traffic lights and on/off ramps where cars slow down or stop. To avoid being robbed when buying jewelry or electronics outside high-end stores, many vendors offer to deliver your purchase to your home or hotel for a fee. Crime can happen anywhere and at any time, even in and around Kruger National Park. U.S. government staff and visitors have been robbed near our diplomatic facilities. It's especially important to be cautious in the central business districts (CBDs) of major cities, especially after dark. Crime victims have also been followed from OR Tambo Airport in Johannesburg and then robbed when they reach their home or hotel.

Theft can be bold and in broad daylight. Travelers and U.S. diplomats report having cell phones stolen from their hands, as well as purses or wallets taken off counters while paying for goods at stores. Car theft and hijacking continues to plague the country, particularly in large cities. Travelers should choose secure parking options and double check locked doors before leaving a parked car.

Throughout South Africa, U.S. citizens should:

* Avoid walking alone especially after dark.
* Avoid visiting informal settlement areas unless you are with someone familiar with the area. Please note that U.S. mission staff are required to use fully armored vehicles when visiting many townships in and around the Cape Town area and visiting hours are restricted to between 0700-1500 hours.
* Do not display cash and valuables.
* Avoid cash-in-transit vehicles both on the road, as well as ATMs when being refilled. Armed criminal gangs frequently target cash-in-transit vehicles while stopped at customer sites, but also ambush cash-in-transit vehicles while on the road. Such violent armed attacks involve automatic weapons, explosives, and gangs of criminals. Criminals frequently use remote jamming and signal interceptors with success.
* Drive with doors locked and windows closed.
* Always carry a copy of your U.S. passport and visa (if applicable). Keep original documents in a secure location.
* Avoid driving during periods of load shedding (rolling blackouts) as the roads can become extremely congested due to a lack of traffic signals. These traffic jams and slow-moving traffic can provide opportunities for smash and grab robberies.

**Student Groups:** There have been instances of student groups being robbed while conducting outreach and service visits in townships. On these occasions, student groups coordinated with officials to conduct service visits and upon arrival were held and then robbed by armed perpetrators.

**Demonstrations** occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Past demonstrations have turned violent.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**Internet romance and financial scams** are prevalent in South Africa. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help.

**Tips to avoid scammers:**

• Look for red flags such as individuals who say they live in a remote location, a profile that was recently created or seems to be too good to be true, the pace of the relationship is moving too quickly, or requests for money.

* Set up a phone call/video chat in the initial stages.
* Do a reverse image search on the profile picture.
* If the individual asking for help claims to be a U.S. citizen, rather than helping them, you should refer them to the closest U.S. Embassy or Consulate so we can work with local authorities to assist them.

**Common scams include:**

* Romance/Online dating
* Money transfers
* Lucrative sales
* Gold purchase
* Contracts with promises of large commissions
* Grandparent/Relative targeting
* Free Trip/Luggage
* Lotteries
* Inheritance notices
* Work permits/job offers
* Bank overpayments

**Technology Usage Abroad:** Mobile devices are vulnerable to compromise, theft, and physical damage anywhere in the world. Best practices prior to traveling abroad include keeping all software (for operating systems and apps) updated and using virtual private network (VPN) and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications if possible. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi.

**GPS navigation apps**. Prior to using the GPS navigation apps, make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. GPS navigation apps may give you the shortest route without safety consideration.

**Dating apps and websites**. Be careful when using dating apps and online dating websites in foreign countries as scammers may target U.S. citizens. Let your friends and family know where you are, meet in a popular public place, and avoid eating or drinking anything suspicious. Don't go to bars or nightclubs alone.

**Credit cards and ATMs.** Travelers need not surrender their credit card to any vendor. They will bring a credit card machine to customers.

Be cautious when using ATMs outside of banks and reputable hotels because ATM and Credit Card skimming is common. Thieves may pretend to help you use a malfunctioning ATM and steal your ATM cards. Skimmers have also been found on machines used to pay parking tickets at shopping malls and office buildings. To avoid this risk, pay parking fees with cash.

**Victims of Crime:**

U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault or domestic violence should report crimes to the local police at 10111. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.

See our webpage on [help for U.S. victims of crime overseas](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/crime.html).

**The U.S. Consulates General in South Africa can:**

* help you find appropriate medical care
* assist you in reporting a crime to the police
* contact relatives or friends with your written consent
* explain the local criminal justice process in general terms
* provide a list of local attorneys
* provide information on [victim’s compensation programs in the U.S.](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/crime.html)
* provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution
* help you find accommodation and arrange flights home
* replace a stolen or lost passport

**Terrorism Threat:**Extremists with ties to international terrorist organizations, such as al-Qai’ida, al-Shabaab, and ISIS, historically have used South Africa as a logistical hub to conduct recruitment and financial facilitation. There has been increased activity by ISIS sympathizers and supporters locally, including the placement of incendiary devices and kidnapping for ransom operations. South African authorities have periodically arrested individuals and charged them with terrorism related crimes. The U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control has publicly designated ISIS members operating in South Africa who have provided technical, financial, or material support to the terrorist group. Check the [Mission’s website](https://za.usembassy.gov/category/alert/) to review Alerts to U.S. citizens, and [register](https://step.state.gov/) with the U.S. Mission to South Africa to receive new Alerts by email during your travels.

**Game parks and outdoor safety:** Visitors have been injured and killed by wild animals in South Africa. It is dangerous to leave your vehicle in game parks outside of designated areas. Observe all park regulations and follow the instructions of guides. Be mindful of sharks when swimming. Rip tides are common and very dangerous. Do not swim alone in isolated areas or dive into unfamiliar waters.

Hikers must be prepared for rapidly changing weather conditions and ensure they have proper clothing and supplies. Many areas, especially in the Western Cape province, experience brush fires during the summer months (December-February). These fires can burn for several days. Monitor local media and follow fire crew instructions regarding road closures and evacuations.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is regulated. Rules for best practices and safety inspections are enforced. Hazardous areas are marked with signs and professional staff are available for organized activities. If you get hurt, there is medical treatment available. Outside of big cities, it might take longer for help to come. It's a good idea for U.S. citizens to get medical evacuation insurance. U.S. citizens are strongly encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.

See our webpage for more information on [insurance providers for overseas coverage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html).

**Infrastructure:** In the country, there are often scheduled blackouts called "Load Shedding". These blackouts are meant to protect the electrical grid, but they cause the whole country to lose power for up to six hours every day. This is bad for businesses that don't have another way to get power, like hotels. Load shedding also causes traffic lights to stop working, which leads to traffic jams and more crime. It can also affect access to water, cell phone signal, fuel availability, and safety features in rural areas.
