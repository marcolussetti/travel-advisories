**Road conditions and safety**Road conditions are good in South Africa. Traffic deaths are much higher than in the United States.

* High traffic deaths are caused by bad driving, weak traffic law enforcement, road rage, aggressive driving, distractions, and drunk driving.
* Avoid driving at night.
* Traffic lights are frequently out of order.
* Border delays in South Africa can occur due to closures or reduced services, causing long waits.

**Traffic laws**

* Traffic drives on the left, and the steering wheel is on the right side of the car.
* Seatbelts are required for all passengers by law.
* It is illegal to text or use cell phones without hands-free devices while driving.
* Treat all intersections with malfunctioning traffic lights as a four-way stop.
* International driver’s licenses are not required.
* A valid driver’s license from any U.S. state or territory is valid for stays of less than six months.

**Public transportation**

* **Taxis:** Consider using only reputable dispatched taxis, hotel cabs and tour buses.
* **Minibus taxis:** These are often unlicensed and unsafe.

U.S. government employees are not allowed to use minibus taxis, wave down taxis on the street, or use a taxi stand.

**Ridesharing companies**

* Prior to entering a ridesharing vehicle, verify all the trip information (vehicle make and model, license plate number, driver’s name or picture).
* Do not use these services for remote travel.
* Pick up and drop off location should be away from taxi stands due to tensions.
* U.S. government employees may only use ridesharing services (Uber, Lyft, etc.) with a dispatch application that provides vehicle description, license plate number, driver’s name, picture, user rating, and the ability to share trip information.

**Rail service**

These services are safe. However, mechanical problems and crime may occur:

* **Long-distance:** Shosholoza Meyl
* **Rapid:** Gautrain in Gauteng Province
* **Luxury:** Shosholoza Meyl Premier Classe, Blue Train, and Rovos Rail.

U.S. government employees are not allowed to use the **Metrorail commuter service** due to safety concerns and crime. There have been reports of fires being set on Metrorail train cars.

**Aviation safety oversight**The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has found that South Africa’s Civil Aviation Authority meets international standards for aviation safety oversight. FAA’s website includes more information on its assessment program.
