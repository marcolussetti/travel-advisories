***Updated to reflect information on kidnappings.***

Exercise increased caution in South Africa due to **crime**, **civil unrest, and kidnapping**. 

**Country Summary:**  Violent crime is common and includes armed robbery, rape, carjacking, and mugging.  There are also "smash-and-grab" attacks on vehicles.  Violent crime is more common in the downtown areas of big cities, especially after dark.

Demonstrations, protests, and strikes occur and can arise without warning.  They often interrupt traffic, transportation, and other services with the potential to turn violent.

There is a threat of kidnapping across South Africa.  In the past, kidnappers have targeted U.S. citizens and other foreign travelers.  Criminals kidnap individuals for financial gain, often forcing victims to withdraw money and provide passwords for online accounts before releasing them.  While rare, kidnappings to extort ransom from family members also occur and many of these incidents involve violence.
