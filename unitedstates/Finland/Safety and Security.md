# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:** Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad.  Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds.  Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

European governments are taking action to guard against terrorist attacks; however, all European countries remain potentially vulnerable to attacks from transnational terrorist organizations.

**Crime**: Finland has a low rate of crime and violent crime is uncommon.  Keep an inconspicuous profile and remain aware of your surroundings at all times.

* The most common criminal threat is petty street crime such as pickpocketing.  Avoid leaving personal possessions unattended while in public. The most serious criminal threat is a lone-wolf terrorist attack.  Finland had one such attack in 2017, resulting in two fatalities and eight injuries.
* Motorcycle gangs and Russian organized crime have a limited presence in Finland, but expatriates are unlikely to encounter them. Remain vigilant with regard to your personal security and exercise caution.

**Victims of Crime**:  Report crimes to the local police by dialing **112**, and contact the U.S. Embassy at **+ (358) 9-616-250**.  Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.

**Tourism:**The tourism industry is generally regulated and rules are regularly enforced. Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance.
