# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Finland has an extensive network of highways and excellent public transportation services throughout the country. Driving in Finland is on the right side.

* A valid U.S. driver’s license may be used while visiting Finland, but drivers must be at least 18 years of age.
* Traffic approaching from the right has priority, even if entering a primary roadway from a secondary one.  Stop signs are rarely used in Finland.
* It is common practice in Finland, including in large cities, to turn off traffic lights at certain intersections in the early morning hours.
* Road signs use standard international symbols and Finnish text.
* Many urban streets have traffic lanes reserved for public transportation only.

**Winter driving in Finland can be hazardous**. Daylight hours are very short and drivers should be comfortable driving in darkness.

* Icy road conditions are common.
* Your vehicle must have snow tires from December through February. Engine heaters are strongly recommended.
* When driving at night, drivers must be alert to moose wandering onto major roadways. Striking a moose can severely damage a vehicle and even fatally injure its occupants.
* If you are in a car accident, you must have your insurance paperwork with you.

**Traffic Laws**: Unless otherwise noted on traffic signs, the speed limit varies from 30 to 40 km/h in urban areas, 80 km/h on open roads, and 120 km/h on expressways during summer (100 km/h in winter).

* Vehicles must use headlights at all times.
* Use of seatbelts is mandatory for drivers and all passengers.
* Children under 135 cm (approximately 53 inches) in height must be seated in approved child or booster seats or use appropriate safety equipment as stated on the [Finnish Police website](https://poliisi.fi/en/traffic-safety-and-surveillance).
* Drunk driving laws are strict.

o   Police strictly enforce all traffic laws and institute random roadside breath-analyzer tests. Drivers who register a 0.05% or higher blood-alcohol content are subject to immediate arrest. For more information, please review the [Finnish Police website](https://poliisi.fi/en/traffic-safety-and-surveillance).

**Public Transportation**: Public transportation in Finland is of good quality and is the recommended method of travel.

* Passenger trains, intercity buses, and air flights provide regular service over longer distances.
* Public transportation in urban centers includes buses, subways, trams, suburban trains, and taxis.
* Taxis are more expensive than in major U.S. cities. Rates vary widely depending on the company providing the transportation service.
* Most local residents use public transport in Helsinki as parking is expensive and can be hard to find.
