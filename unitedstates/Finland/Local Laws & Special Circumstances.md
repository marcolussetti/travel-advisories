# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties**: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.  Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification**: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**LGB Travelers**: There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Finland.

See our [LGB Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgbti.html) page and section 6 of our [Human Rights Report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Travelers** **Who Require Accessibility Assistance**: Laws mandating access to buildings for persons with disabilities are generally enforced, but many older buildings remain inaccessible. Some public transportation systems are less adapted to individuals with disabilities. You should check ahead with your hotel/destination to learn more about options to accommodate disabled traveler needs before visiting Finland.

* Most forms of public transportation are accessible, but geographically-isolated areas can be especially problematic for travelers with disabilities.
* Call ahead to restaurants, museums, and other facilities to find out if they are wheel-chair accessible.
* [Assistance for train travelers](https://www.vr.fi/cs/vr/en/frontpage) is available at most stations but must be requested in advance. For more information, visit the [Finnish National Tourist Board’s website](https://www.visitfinland.com/en/).
