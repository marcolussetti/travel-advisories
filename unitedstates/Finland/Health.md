Medical facilities and staff are generally excellent and widely available for emergency services. English is commonly spoken by Finnish medical personnel. The public hospital system and many private hospitals accept foreign credit cards.

* Local medical centers, clinics, or first-aid stations are located at hospitals and will provide a full range of services to tourist and temporary visitors.
* For emergency services in Finland, **dial 112**.

Ambulance services are widely available.

**We do not pay medical bills**. Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas.  Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance**: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas.  Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments.  See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance coverage overseas.  Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.  Check with the [government of Finland](https://www.choosehealthcare.fi/medicines/bringing-medicines-to-finland/) to ensure the medication is legal in Finland.

* You may bring a 90-day supply of most personal prescription drugs with a formal doctor’s note.
* **Prescribed narcotics** may only be brought into Finland for your personal use **for a maximum of 14 days and must be accompanied by a medical certificate** stating why you need them.
* Finnish customs regulations prohibit you from receiving medication shipments from abroad.  Local physicians may be reluctant to prescribe equivalent quantities or dosages.

**Air Quality:** Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas. Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in [destination]. For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/). For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).
