For emergency services in Canada, **dial 911**. Ambulance services are widely available.

**We do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with [Health Canada](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/medication) to ensure the medication is legal in Canada.

**Healthcare in Canada**: The level of public health and sanitation in Canada is high. Adequate health facilities are available throughout Canada.  Canada’s medical care is of a high standard but is government controlled. Access to ongoing medical care is difficult for temporary visitors who are not members of a Canadian province’s government-run health care plan. Many physicians will not take new patients. Specialist care is only by referral and may take months to obtain. Although trauma-care is on par with that in the United States, emergency room waits for non-life threatening problems can be very long. Some health care professionals in the Quebec may only speak French.

The U.S. Embassy maintains [a list of doctors and hospitals](https://ca.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/local-resources-for-u-s-citizens/doctors/). We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.

**Vaccinations:**Be up-to-date on all CDC-recommended [vaccinations](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm).

**Pharmaceuticals:** U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/buyingusingmedicinesafely/buyingmedicinefromoutsidetheunitedstates/default.htm) websites for more information.
