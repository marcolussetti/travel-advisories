**Emergency number**

**Dial 911** for all emergencies

**Ambulance services**Ambulance services are widely available in Canada.

**Healthcare in Canada**Medical care in Canada is of high quality; it is managed by the government.

* Canada has high standards for public health and sanitation.
* There are good healthcare facilities throughout the country.
* Temporary visitors who are not part of a Canadian province’s healthcare plan may find it hard to get ongoing care.
* Many doctors are not accepting new patients. Seeing a specialist requires a referral, which can take months.
* While trauma care is excellent, emergency room waits for non-life-threatening issues can be very long.
* American patients without Canadian health insurance frequently travel back to the United States for medical care.
* In Quebec, some healthcare professionals may only speak French.
