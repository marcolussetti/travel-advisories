# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

For tourist visits to Canada of less than 180 days, U.S. citizens do not need visas. Other types of travel generally require visas. Visit [the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) website](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship.html) for current information.

If you have a criminal record, you may be unable to enter Canada. To determine whether you are criminally inadmissible and get information about how to overcome this finding, refer to the [IRCC website](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/inadmissibility/overcome-criminal-convictions.html). [Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)](https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/menu-eng.html) officials determine if you can enter Canada in accordance with Canadian law.

**Travel Programs:**Both the U.S. and Canadian governments urge frequent travelers to join the [NEXUS trusted traveler program](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/nexus).

**Entry into Canada:** Canadian law requires that all persons entering Canada carry proof of citizenship and identity. A valid U.S. passport, passport card, or NEXUS card satisfies these requirements for U.S. citizens.

Children under 16 only need proof of U.S. citizenship.

**Entry into the United States:** When traveling by air from Canada, U.S. citizens must present a U.S. passport book or other approved identification document. [The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) website](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/western-hemisphere-travel-initiative) provides a full list of allowable documents.

**Travel with Minors:**If you plan to travel to Canada with a minor for whom you do not have full legal custody, CBSA may require a letter of authorization from the minor’s parents or legal guardian(s). Please refer to the [CBSA website](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/minor-children-travelling-canada.html) for more details.

**Private Boaters Entering Canada:** Canadian law requires all foreign private boaters, including recreational vessels, to present themselves upon their arrival in Canada to the CBSA. See the [CBSA website](https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/travel-voyage/pb-pp-eng.html) for relevant reporting requirements.

**Private Boaters Exiting Canada:** Boaters may report their arrival to the United States or apply for a registered boater program using the CBP Reporting Offsite Arrival – Mobile (CBP ROAM) app. Please visit the [CBP ROAM webpage](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/pleasure-boats-private-flyers/pleasure-boat-overview/roam) for more information.
