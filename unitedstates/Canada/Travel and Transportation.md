**Weather**

**Seasons**

Canadian winters can be harsh.

* Temperatures are cold in the south and extremely cold in the north.
* Cyclonic storms east of the Rockies form when cold air from the Arctic, moist air from the Pacific, and dry air from the interior mix. These storms bring most of the country's rain and snow.

**Natural disasters**

Wildfires are common. They disrupt travel and cause poor air quality warnings, particularly in the Western portions of Canada. The most active wildfire period is from May through September.
