# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you break local laws, even if you don’t know, you may be kicked out of the area, arrested, or put in prison. Police may detain you for questioning if you don’t have your passport with you. If you want to start a business or work in a job that needs special permits or licenses, you should get information from the local authorities before you start.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

* Crimes of fraud, including passing bad checks, non-payment of bills (including hotel bills), or breach of contract are considered serious in Morocco and can often result in imprisonment and/or fines.
* Bail generally is not available to non-residents of Morocco who are arrested for crimes involving fraud.
* Debtors can be held in prison until their debts are paid or until an agreement is reached between the parties.
* The Moroccan government may seize passports to guarantee that debtors settle their cases.
* Debtors may be unable to work in Morocco without passports while still being held responsible for their debts.
* Before signing a contract, you may want to consider consulting an attorney.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Consulate immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries. They may be illegal according to local laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods may post significant risks to consumer health and safety. You may be subject to fines and/or have to give up counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States. See the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection website](https://www.cbp.gov/trade/fakegoodsrealdangers#:~:text=It%20is%20illegal%20to%20purchase%20counterfeit%20goods.%20Bringing,activities%2C%20such%20as%20forced%20labor%20or%20human%20trafficking.) and [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/) for more information.

**Faith-Based Travelers:** Islam is the official religion in Morocco. However, the constitution provides for the freedom to practice one's religion. The Moroccan government does not interfere with public worship by the country’s Jewish minority or by expatriate Christians. Proselytizing is, however, prohibited. In the past, U.S. citizens have been arrested, detained, and/or expelled for discussing or trying to engage Moroccans in debate about Christianity. In February 2014, several U.S. citizens were expelled from Morocco for alleged proselytizing. Many of those expelled were long-time Moroccan residents. In these cases, U.S. citizens were given no more than 48 hours to gather their belongings or settle their affairs before being expelled.

**International Volunteers:**

**LGB Travelers:** Consensual, same-sex sexual relations are criminalized in Morocco. Penalties include fines and up to three years’ imprisonment. See our [LGB](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgb.html) Travel Information page and our [Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports-bureau-of-democracy-human-rights-and-labor/country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** The law in Morocco prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual or mental disabilities. Society’s acceptance and inclusion of persons with disabilities is not as prevalent as in the United States. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure, although the national rail system offers wheelchair ramps, accessible bathrooms, and designated seating areas. While building codes enacted in 2003 require accessibility for all persons, the codes exempt most pre-2003 structures, and authorities rarely enforce them for new construction. See our [Travelers with Disabilities](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/traveling-with-disabilties.html) page.

**Students:** See our [Students Abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/students.html) page and [FBI travel tips](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/student-travel-brochure-pdf.pdf/view).

**Women Travelers:** Women walking alone in certain areas of cities and rural areas are particularly vulnerable to assault by men. They should exercise caution when in public spaces, including nightclubs or other social establishments. Women are advised to travel with a companion or in a group when possible and to ignore any harassment. See our tips for [Women Travelers](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/women-travelers.html).

**Customs:** See Quick Facts for currency restrictions. Moroccan currency can be converted back into U.S. dollars prior to departure only if the traveler has a bank or money transfer receipt indicating he or she exchanged dollars for dirhams while in Morocco.

Moroccan customs authorities may enforce strict regulations concerning temporary importation into or export from Morocco of items such as firearms, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) or drones, religious materials, antiquities, business equipment, and large quantities of currency. It is advisable to contact the [Embassy of Morocco in Washington, D.C.](https://us.diplomatie.ma/en), or the [Moroccan Consulate General in New York](https://us.diplomatie.ma/en/consulate-general-kingdom-morocco-new-york) for specific information concerning customs requirements. Please see our information on [Customs and Import Restrictions](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/customs-and-import.html).

**Citizenship:** The Government of Morocco considers all persons born to Moroccan fathers to be Moroccan citizens. In addition to being subject to all U.S. laws, dual U.S.-Moroccan citizens are subject to Moroccan law. Recently, Morocco has begun allowing Moroccan mothers of children born outside Morocco to petition for their children’s citizenship. For further information on that process, please contact the [Embassy of Morocco in Washington, D.C.](https://us.diplomatie.ma/en), or the [Moroccan Consulate General in New York](https://us.diplomatie.ma/en/consulate-general-kingdom-morocco-new-york).

**Residence Permits:** In order to obtain a residence permit, travelers must present (among other requirements) a criminal history record check. This record check can only be obtained in the United States. The U.S. Consulate and Embassy are unable to take fingerprints to send for FBI record requests. For specific information, individuals seeking a residence permit should visit their local police station.

The following documents must accompany a residence permit renewal application:

* Birth Certificate
* Copy of the current passport
* Copy of the current Moroccan residence card
* Medical certificate from a doctor stating that the requester is free from any contagious disease
* Court record (casier judiciaire) obtained from the Ministry of Justice in Rabat
* 100 MAD (dirham) stamp

Individuals planning on residing in Morocco or relocating to the United States may be asked to provide a notarized change of residence form. This form is available at the U.S. Consulate by appointment.

**Sending Passports through the Mail:** According to Moroccan law, it is prohibited to send passports by mail across international borders. Passports sent to or through Morocco via Fedex, DHL, or other courier will be confiscated by Moroccan authorities. Confiscated U.S. passports are eventually sent to the U.S. Consulate General in Casablanca after being processed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. If your passport has been confiscated, you can contact the American Citizens Services section at <acscasablanca@state.gov> to ask if it has been received.

**Property:** U.S. consular officers are prohibited by law and regulation from accepting personal property for safekeeping regardless of the circumstances involved. If there is concern over the protection of property left behind in Morocco due to confiscation or deportation for political, legal, or other reasons, U.S. citizens should take every precaution to ensure that available legal safeguards are in place either before, or immediately after, purchasing property in Morocco or taking up residence there. U.S. citizens are also encouraged to seek [local legal advice](https://ma.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/local-resources-of-u-s-citizens/attorneys/) on assigning a Power of Attorney, or Procuration, to be used in Morocco if necessary. More information and sample Power of Attorney forms are available on the [Consulate General of the Kingdom of Morocco in New York](https://us.diplomatie.ma/en/consulate-general-kingdom-morocco-new-york) website.

**Photographing Sensitive Locations:** Taking photographs of anything that could be considered of military or security interest may result in problems with Moroccan authorities. Travelers should not photograph palaces, diplomatic missions, government buildings, or other sensitive facilities. When in doubt travelers should ask permission from the appropriate Moroccan authorities.

**Professional Basketball in Morocco:** The U.S. Consulate General in Casablanca is aware that there are local professional basketball teams who have made contracts with U.S. citizens to play on Moroccan teams. Some of these players have subsequently claimed they were not paid as stipulated per the terms of the contract. Individuals considering playing basketball professionally in Morocco may wish to consult with a lawyer regarding the terms of their contract prior to signing. A [list of lawyers](https://ma.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/local-resources-of-u-s-citizens/attorneys/) can be found on the Embassy's webpage.
