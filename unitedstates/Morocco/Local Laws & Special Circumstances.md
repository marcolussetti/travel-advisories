# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. In some places you may be taken in for questioning if you don’t have your passport with you.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification**: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Consulate immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

* Crimes of fraud, including passing bad checks, non-payment of bills (including hotel bills), or breach of contract are considered serious in Morocco and can often result in imprisonment and/or fines.
* Bail generally is not available to non-residents of Morocco who are arrested for crimes involving fraud.
* Debtors can be held in prison until their debts are paid or until an agreement is reached between the parties.
* Passports may be seized by the Moroccan government to guarantee that debtors settle their cases.
* Debtors may be unable to work in Morocco without passports while still being held responsible for their debts.
* Prior to entering into a contract, you may want to consider consulting an attorney.

**Faith-Based Travelers**: Islam is the official religion in Morocco. However, the constitution provides for the freedom to practice one's religion. The Moroccan government does not interfere with public worship by the country’s Jewish minority or by expatriate Christians. Proselytizing is, however, prohibited. In the past, U.S. citizens have been arrested, detained, and/or expelled for discussing or trying to engage Moroccans in debate about Christianity. In February 2014, several U.S. citizens were expelled from Morocco for alleged proselytizing. Many of those expelled were long-time Moroccan residents. In these cases, U.S. citizens were given no more than 48 hours to gather their belongings or settle their affairs before being expelled. See the [Department of State’s International Religious Freedom Report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm#wrapper).

**LGB Travelers:** Consensual same-sex sexual relations are criminalized in Morocco. Penalties include fines and jail time. Seeour [LGB Travel Information](/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgb.html) page and section 6 of our[Human Rights report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:** While in Morocco, individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation very different from what is customary in the United States.

**Students:** See our [Students Abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/studentsabroad/en.html) page and [FBI travel tips](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/student-travel-brochure-pdf.pdf/view).

**Women Travelers**: Women walking alone in certain areas of cities and rural areas are particularly vulnerable to assault by men. They should exercise caution when in public spaces, including nightclubs or other social establishments. Women are advised to travel with a companion or in a group when possible and to ignore any harassment. See our tips for [Women Travelers](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/Women.html).

**Customs:** Travelers must declare large quantities of U.S. dollars brought into the country at the port of entry. The export of Moroccan currency (dirhams) is prohibited; however, Moroccan currency can be converted back into U.S. dollars prior to departure only if the traveler has a bank or money transfer receipt indicating he or she exchanged dollars for dirhams while in Morocco.

Moroccan customs authorities may enforce strict regulations concerning temporary importation into or export from Morocco of items such as firearms, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) or drones, religious materials, antiquities, business equipment, and large quantities of currency. It is advisable to contact the [Embassy of Morocco in Washington, D.C.,](http://www.embassy.org/embassies/ma.html) or the [Moroccan Consulate General in New York](http://www.moroccanconsulate.com/) for specific information concerning customs requirements.

Please see our information on [Customs and Import Restrictions.](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/customs.html)

**Citizenship**: The Government of Morocco considers all persons born to Moroccan fathers to be Moroccan citizens. In addition to being subject to all U.S. laws, U.S. citizens who also possess the nationality of Morocco may be subject to other laws that impose special obligations on citizens of Morocco. Recently, Morocco has begun allowing Moroccan mothers of children born outside Morocco to petition for their children’s citizenship. For further information on that process, please contact the [Embassy of Morocco in Washington, D.C.,](http://www.embassy.org/embassies/ma.html) or the [Moroccan Consulate General in New York](http://www.moroccanconsulate.com/).

**Residency Permits:** In order to obtain a residence permit, travelers must present (among other requirements) a criminal history record check. This record check can only be obtained in the United States. The U.S. Consulate and Embassy are unable to take fingerprints to send for FBI record requests. For specific information, individuals seeking residency should visit their local police station.

The following documents must accompany a residency renewal application:

* Birth Certificate
* Copy of the current passport
* Copy of the current Moroccan residency card
* Medical certificate from a doctor stating that the requester is free from any contagious disease
* Court record (Casier Judiciaire) obtained from the Ministry of Justice in Rabat
* 100 MAD stamp

Individuals planning on residing in Morocco or relocating to the U.S. may be asked to provide a notarized change of residence form. This form is available at the U.S. Consulate by appointment.

**Sending Passports through the Mail:** According to Moroccan law, it is prohibited to send passports by mail across international borders. Passports sent to or through Morocco via Fedex, DHL, or other courier will be confiscated by Moroccan authorities. Confiscated U.S. passports are eventually sent to the U.S. Consulate General in Casablanca after being processed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. If your passport has been confiscated, you can contact the American Citizens Services section at [acscasablanca@state.gov](mailto:acscasablanca@state.gov) to ask if it has been received.

**Property:** U.S. consular officers are prohibited by law and regulation from accepting personal property for safekeeping regardless of the circumstances involved. If there is concern over the protection of property left behind in Morocco due to confiscation or deportation for political, legal, or other reasons, U.S. citizens should take every precaution to ensure that available legal safeguards are in place either before, or immediately after, purchasing property in Morocco or taking up residence there. U.S. citizens are also encouraged to consider assigning a Power of Attorney, or Procuration, to be used in Morocco if necessary. More information and sample Power of Attorney forms are available on the [Consulate General of the Kingdom of Morocco in New York](http://www.moroccanconsulate.com/) website.

**Photographing Sensitive Locations:** Taking photographs of anything that could be perceived as being of military or security interest may result in problems with the authorities. As a general rule, travelers should not photograph palaces, diplomatic missions, government buildings, or other sensitive facilities and when in doubt should ask permission from the appropriate Moroccan authorities.

**Professional Basketball in Morocco:** The U.S. Consulate General in Casablanca is aware that there are local professional basketball teams who have made contracts with U.S. citizens to play on Moroccan teams. Some of these players have subsequently claimed they were not paid as stipulated per the terms of the contract.  Individuals considering playing basketball professionally in Morocco may wish to consult with a lawyer regarding the terms of their contract prior to signing. A [list of lawyers](https://ma.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/local-resources-of-u-s-citizens/attorneys/) can be found on the Embassy's webpage.
