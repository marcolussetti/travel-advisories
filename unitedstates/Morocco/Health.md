Adequate medical care is available in Morocco’s largest cities, particularly in Rabat and Casablanca, although not all facilities meet Western standards.

* Emergency and specialized care outside the major cities is far below U.S. standards and may not be available at all.
* Most medical staff will have limited or no English-speaking ability.
* Most ordinary prescription and over-the-counter medicines are widely available.
* Specialized prescriptions may be difficult to fill and availability of all medicines in rural areas is unreliable.
* Travelers should not ask friends or relatives to send medications through the mail, FedEx, or UPS since Moroccan customs will impound the delivery and not release it to the recipient.
* Travelers planning to drive in the mountains and other remote areas may wish to carry a medical kit and a Moroccan phone card for emergencies.
* In the event of vehicle accidents involving injuries, immediate ambulance service is usually not available. The police emergency services telephone number is “190” (see Traffic Safety and Road Conditions section below).

Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas.

**Medical Insurance**

Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. You may also be required to pay a deposit before being admitted for treatment. See our webpage for more [information on insurance providers for overseas coverage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/health/insurance-providers.html). We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/health/insurance-providers.html) to cover medical evacuation.

If traveling with prescription medication, check with the [Government of Morocco Ministry of Foreign Affairs](https://us.diplomatie.ma/) to ensure the medication is legal in Morocco. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.

Vaccinations: Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Air Quality**

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.

* Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in Morocco.
* For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/).
* For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).
