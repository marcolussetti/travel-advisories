Adequate medical care is available in Morocco’s largest cities, particularly in Rabat and Casablanca. Not all facilities meet U.S. standards, especially in rural areas.

* Emergency and specialized care outside the major cities is far below U.S. standards and may not be available at all.
* Most medical staff may have limited or no English-speaking ability.
* Most ordinary prescription and over-the-counter medicines are widely available.
* Specialized prescriptions may be difficult to fill and availability of all medicines in rural areas is unreliable.
* Travelers should not ask friends or relatives to send medications through the mail, FedEx, or UPS because Moroccan customs will impound the delivery and not release it to the recipient.
* Travelers planning to drive in the mountains and other remote areas may wish to carry a medical kit and a Moroccan phone card for emergencies.
* In the event of vehicle accidents involving injuries, immediate ambulance service is usually not available. The police emergency services telephone number is “190” (see Traffic Safety and Road Conditions section below).

For emergency services in Morocco, dial 15.

* Ambulance services are: Not widely available and training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

**The Department of State, U.S. embassies, and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. You may also be required to pay a deposit before being admitted for treatment. See our [Insurance Overseas](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20government%20does%20not%20provide%20insurance%20for,health%2C%20visit%20our%20page%20on%20Your%20Health%20Abroad.) page for more information on insurance providers with overseas coverage. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Travel Insurance page](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

* We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html?cq_ck=1708701048867) to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the [Government of Morocco Ministry of Foreign Affairs](https://us.diplomatie.ma/) to ensure the medication is legal in Morocco.

**Vaccinations:** Be up to date on all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Air Quality**Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.

* Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in Morocco.
* For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/).
* For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).

**Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery**

**Pharmaceuticals**

* Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, which can be bought without a prescription or with a prescription in the United States, are usually easy to buy with few controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may not work or have the wrong strength.
* U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration have rules for bringing medication back to the United States. Medication bought abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back. The medication must be for personal use and approved for use in the United States. Visit the websites of [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/fda-drug-info-rounds-video/traveling-prescription-medications) for more information.

**Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy**

* If you are considering traveling to Morocco to have a child through use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) or surrogacy, please see our [ART and Surrogacy Abroad page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Assisted-Reproductive-Technology-ART-Surrogacy-Abroad.html).
* Surrogacy is illegal in Morocco.
* Although surrogacy agencies/clinics may claim surrogacy is legal in Morocco, there is no legal framework to pursue surrogacy in Morocco. As a result, surrogacy agreements between intending parents and gestational mothers are not enforced by Moroccan courts.
* If you decide to pursue parenthood in Morocco via assisted reproductive technology (ART) with a gestational mother, be prepared for long and unexpected delays in documenting your child’s citizenship. Be aware that individuals who attempt to circumvent local law risk criminal prosecution.

**Water Quality & Food Safety:** In many areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe. Many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.

**Altitude:** Some locations in Morocco, such as the Atlas Mountains, are at high altitude. Be aware of the symptoms of altitude sickness and take precautions before you travel. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about [Travel to High Altitudes](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/travel-to-high-altitudes).
