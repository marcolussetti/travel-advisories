**Road Conditions and Safety:** Traffic accidents are a significant hazard in Morocco. Driving practices are very poor and have resulted in serious injuries to and fatalities of U.S. citizens. This is particularly true at dusk during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, when adherence to traffic regulations is lax, and from July to September when Moroccans living abroad return from Europe by car in large numbers.

* Exercise extreme caution when driving at night due to poor lighting along roads.
* Traffic signals do not always work and are sometimes hard to see.
* Modern freeways link the cities of Tangier, Rabat, Fez, Casablanca, and Marrakesh. Two-lane highways link other major cities.
* Secondary routes in rural areas are often narrow and poorly paved. Roads through the Rif and Atlas Mountains are steep, narrow, windy, and dangerous.
* Pedestrians, scooters, and animal-drawn vehicles are common on all roadways, including the freeways.
* During the rainy season (November - March), flash flooding is frequent and sometimes severe, washing away roads and vehicles in rural areas.

**Traffic Laws:** In the event of a traffic accident, including accidents involving injuries, the parties are required to remain at the scene and not move their vehicles until the police have arrived and documented all necessary information. The police emergency phone number is “190”. Moroccan police officers often pull over drivers for inspection within the city and on highways.

**Traffic Fines:** Confiscation of a driver’s license is possible if a violator is unable or unwilling to settle a fine at the time of a traffic stop.

If you are stopped for a speeding violation, you have the right to request the video footage documenting the infraction. Once the speeding violation is confirmed, you have three options:

* Pay the fine on the spot and obtain a receipt of payment.
* Pay at the local city’s treasury (La Perception). The police/gendarme officer will issue you a ticket indicating the amount of the fine and keep your driver’s license until you pay the fine.
* If you want to contest a violation, you may file a complaint at court. Moroccan authorities may keep your driver’s license and vehicle registration while this lengthy process takes place.

Foreign driver’s licenses are valid for use in Morocco for up to one year. After that, foreign residents must pass the Moroccan driver’s test and obtain a Moroccan driver’s license. The test is in either

Arabic or French. Speakers of other languages are allowed to have a sworn translator with them when taking the test.

**Public Transportation:** While public buses and taxis are inexpensive, driving habits are poor, and buses are frequently overcrowded. City buses are not safe. The train system has a good safety record. Trains, while sometimes crowded, are comfortable and generally on time.

* Train Station Hotline: 0890 20 30 40
* Bus Station Hotline: 0800 09 00 30
* Directory Inquiry: 160

**Rideshare Apps:** Rideshare apps operate in a legal gray zone across Morocco. Rideshare drivers and passengers have reported harassment and physical violence by taxi drivers. Travelers should exercise caution if traveling via rideshare apps, especially around hotels, airports, convention centers, and other locations frequented by taxi drivers. See our [Road Safety Page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/driving-and-road-safety.html) for more information. Visit the website of Morocco’s [national tourist office](https://www.visitmorocco.com/en/useful-information?id=modalformalites1096) and national authority responsible for road safety.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has found Morocco’s Civil Aviation Authority meets international standards for aviation safety oversight. FAA’s [website](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa) includes more information on its assessment program.

**Maritime Travel:** Mariners and passengers planning travel to Morocco should check for U.S. Maritime [Advisories](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories) and [Alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts). Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard Homeport website](https://www.uscg.mil/Homeport/), and the [NGA Navigational Warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings) website.
