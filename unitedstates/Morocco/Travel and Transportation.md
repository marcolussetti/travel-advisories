# Travel and Transportation

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Traffic accidents are a significant hazard in Morocco. Driving practices are very poor and have resulted in serious injuries to and fatalities of U.S. citizens. This is particularly true at dusk during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, when adherence to traffic regulations is lax, and from July to September when Moroccans resident abroad return from Europe by car in large numbers.

* Drivers should exercise extreme caution when driving at night due to poor lighting systems along roads.
* Traffic signals do not always function, and are sometimes difficult to see.
* Modern freeways link the cities of Tangier, Rabat, Fez, Casablanca, and Marrakesh. Two-lane highways link other major cities.
* Secondary routes in rural areas are often narrow and poorly paved. Roads through the Rif and Atlas mountains are steep, narrow, windy, and dangerous.
* Pedestrians, scooters, and animal-drawn conveyances are common on all roadways, including the freeways, and driving at night should be avoided if possible.
* During the rainy season (November - March), flash flooding is frequent and sometimes severe, washing away roads and vehicles in rural areas.

**Traffic Laws:** In the event of a traffic accident, including accidents involving injuries, the parties are required to remain at the scene and not move their vehicles until the police have arrived and documented all necessary information. The police emergency services telephone number is “190”. Often Moroccan police officers pull over drivers for inspection within the city and on highways.

**Traffic Fines:** Confiscation of a driver’s license is possible if a violator is unable or unwilling to settle a fine at the time of a traffic stop.

If you are stopped for a speeding violation, you have the right to request the video footage documenting the infraction. Once the speeding violation is confirmed, you have three options: 

* Pay the fine on the spot and obtain a receipt of payment;
* Pay at the local city’s treasury (La Perception). The police/gendarme officer will issue you a ‘ticket’ indicating the amount of the fine and keep your driver’s license until you pay the fine.
* Should you wish to contest a violation, you may file a complaint at court; however, Moroccan authorities may keep your driver’s license and vehicle registration while this lengthy process takes place.

Foreign driver’s licenses are valid for use in Morocco for up to one year. After that, foreign residents must pass the Moroccan driver’s test and obtain a Moroccan driver’s license. The test is conducted in Arabic and French. Speakers of other languages are allowed to have a sworn translator with them when taking the test.

**Public Transportation:** While public buses and taxis are inexpensive, driving habits are poor, and buses are frequently overcrowded. City buses are not considered safe. The train system has a good safety record. Trains, while sometimes crowded, are comfortable and generally on time.

Web-based ride-sharing services are not legal in Morocco; however, some well-known companies (UBER and Careem) have attempted operations with limited success. Media reports of ride-sharing drivers being harassed and assaulted by regular taxi drivers were common.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the Government of Morocco’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Morocco’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/).

**Maritime Travel:** Mariners planning travel to Morocco should also check for U.S. maritime advisories and alerts at [www.marad.dot.gov/msci](http://www.marad.dot.gov/msci).
