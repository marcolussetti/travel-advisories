# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

**Passports and Visas:**

* You must have a valid passport with at least one blank page.
* Visas are not required for visits lasting less than 90 days. Visit the [Embassy of the Kingdom of Morocco](https://us.diplomatie.ma/) website for the most current visa information.
* **Overstays:** If you remain in Morocco beyond 90 days without having requested an extension of stay, you will need to appear before a judge prior to departing Morocco. Please contact the immigration office at your local police station for details. Clearance may include the payment of a fine.
* **Lost/Stolen Passports:** U.S. citizens may apply for a temporary emergency passport at the U.S. Consulate General in Casablanca. Please obtain a police report for a lost or stolen passport in the area where the loss or theft occurred. Recently, police have required evidence of U.S. citizenship prior to issuing the report of loss. Airport police may request a police report from travelers who are departing Morocco with a replacement passport for a lost or stolen passport.
* Travelers who plan to reside in Morocco must obtain a residence permit (certificat d’immatriculation). Applications should be submitted to the Bureau des Étrangers of the Prefecture de Police or Commissariat Central in major cities, and to the Gendarmerie in remote areas and villages. Please see the Residence Permits section under the Local Laws and Special Circumstances tab.
* Carry a copy of your U.S. passport with you at all times to have proof of identity and U.S. citizenship readily available, if needed.
* Children who possess U.S. passports and who are born to a Moroccan father may have trouble leaving Morocco without the father's permission, even if the parents are divorced and the mother has legal custody. Under Moroccan law, these children are considered Moroccan citizens.
* U.S. citizen women married to Moroccans do not need their spouse's permission to leave Morocco.

**HIV/AIDS:** The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Morocco.
