# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:** Terrorist groups and individuals inspired by them are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. They are using simpler methods of attack like knives, guns, and vehicles to target crowds. They often go after unprotected or vulnerable targets such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

Credible information indicates terrorist groups continue to plot potential attacks in the region, including Morocco. Lone wolf attacks can occur without warning and are difficult to detect and disrupt. Morocco is an important counterterrorism partner of the United States, and it has capable security services. Moroccan authorities continue to arrest individuals associated with international terrorist groups seeking to attack U.S. or foreign-affiliated and Moroccan government targets. In December 2018, two Scandinavian tourists were murdered by three Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) supporters in the Imlil Mountains near Marrakesh. U.S. citizens are reminded to remain vigilant with regards to their personal security. U.S. citizen campers should camp in guarded campgrounds rather than isolated campsites.

**Crime:** Crime in Morocco is a serious concern, particularly in major cities and tourist areas.

* Use common sense and the same personal security measures you would normally use in a large U.S. city or tourist destination.
* Do not leave bags unattended. Keep them in sight and avoid placing passports, cash, cell phones, or other valuables in the outer pockets of backpacks or purses, or on tables in public places. Do not leave bags slung over the backs of chairs, on hotel or store counters, on top of your suitcase or larger travel bag, or out of your physical control in hotel lobbies, train stations, restaurants, and other public locations.
* Aggressive panhandling, pickpocketing, purse-snatching, theft from unoccupied vehicles, and harassment of women are the most frequently reported issues.
* Criminals use weapons, primarily knives, during some street robberies and burglaries. These crimes have occurred at any time of day or night, not only in isolated places or areas less frequented by visitors, but in crowded areas as well.
* Residential break-ins also occur and have on occasion turned violent, but most criminals look for opportunities based on stealth rather than confrontation.
* Travelers should avoid soccer stadiums and nearby areas on days of scheduled matches as large groups of team supporters have been known to become unruly and harass and assault bystanders.
* Joggers should be mindful of traffic and remain in more heavily populated areas. It is always best to have a jogging companion, dress modestly, and avoid isolated areas or jogging at night.
* At night and when moving about unfamiliar areas, avoid traveling alone and use “petit” taxis which vary by color in the major cities (Casablanca-Red, Rabat-Blue, Marrakech-Tan, etc.).
* City buses are not considered safe; Taxis in Morocco are generally crime-free during the daytime.
* Rideshare drivers and passengers have reported harassment and physical violence by taxi drivers. Travelers should exercise caution if traveling via rideshare apps, especially around hotels, airports, convention centers, and other locations frequented by taxi drivers.
* Trains are generally safe, but theft, regardless of the time of day, sometimes occurs.
* Avoid carrying large sums of cash and be particularly alert when using ATMs. In the event you are victimized by crime or an attempted crime, please report the incident to the local police and the U.S. Consulate General in Casablanca as soon as possible.

**Demonstrations:** Demonstrations occur frequently in Morocco. They typically focus on political or social issues and are rarely confrontational or violent. They may take place in response to political or economic issues. They may also occur on politically significant holidays and during international events.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories
* During periods of heightened regional tension, large demonstrations may take place in major cities.
* By law, all demonstrations require a government permit, but spontaneous unauthorized demonstrations, which have greater potential for violence, can occur. In addition, different unions or groups may organize strikes to protest an emerging issue or government policy.

**Scams:** Internet romance and financial scams are common in Morocco. Review the Department of State’s [Protecting Yourself from Scams](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/scams-and-safety/common-frauds-and-scams) pages for information.

Be careful using dating apps or online dating websites while abroad. Scammers may target U.S. citizens. Tell your friends and family where you are, meet in a popular public place, and avoid consuming suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs.

**Technology Usage Abroad:** Mobile devices can be compromised, stolen, or damaged anywhere in the world. Before traveling abroad, it is best to keep all software (operating system and apps) updated. If possible, use a virtual private network and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi networks.

**Victims of Crime:** U.S. victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Consulate for assistance.

Report crimes to the local police at 19 from a land line or 190 from a mobile phone and contact the U.S. Consulate Casablanca at (212) 522-64-20-00. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Consulate for assistance.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is generally regulated in major tourist areas. Rules about general practices and safety inspections are regularly enforced. Dangerous areas and activities are marked with signs. Trained staff are usually there to help with organized activities. If you get injured, you will likely only find appropriate medical treatment in or near major cities.

Outside of major tourist areas, the tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities are rare. Hazardous areas/activities are not always labeled properly. Staff may not be trained or certified by the host government or recognized authorities. It may take more time for first responders to reach areas outside major cities to provide urgent medical care. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.

**Western Sahara:** From 1975 to 1991, Western Sahara was the site of armed conflict between Moroccan government forces and the POLISARIO Front, which continues to seek independence for the territory. Tensions along the border in Western Sahara heightened in November 2020 when Moroccan forces conducted an operation on the border to clear a blockade by the POLISARIO Front; both sides have since engaged in a low intensity conflict along the border. There are thousands of unexploded mines in the Western Sahara and in areas of Mauritania adjacent to the Western Saharan border. Exploding mines are occasionally reported and have caused death and injury. There have been instances in which U.S. citizens suspected of being participants in political protests or of supporting NGOs that are critical of Moroccan policies have been expelled from, or not been allowed to enter, Western Sahara.

GPS Navigation Apps are helpful for getting around in a foreign country. Before using the GPS app make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. The app may give you the shortest route without safety consideration.
