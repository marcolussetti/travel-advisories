# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Senegalese authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you use for travel.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond the date you expect to leave Senegal.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Visas

Tourist visa: not required for stays of less than 90 days  
Business visa: not required for stays of less than 90 days  
Student visa: not required for stays of less than 90 days

Canadians can enter Senegal without a visa for stays of less than 90 days. A traveller arriving in Senegal without a visa who wishes to extend his or her stay will have to leave the country and re-enter afterwards or contact the Foreigner’s Bureau of the Ministry of the Interior and Public Security to obtain a long-stay visa.

Canadians planning on staying in Senegal for more than 90 days must apply for a visa at the nearest Senegalese embassy or consulate. The visa allows the holder to stay in Senegal for 90 days so that steps can be taken to obtain a “carte d’identité d’étranger” (foreign national identity card) before the end of the period.

### Foreign national identity card

To stay in Senegal for more than 90 days, you must obtain a foreign national identity card from the Direction de la Police des étrangers et des titres de voyage.
