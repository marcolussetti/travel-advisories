## Safety and security

### Casamance and border areas

The conflict in Casamance is historically characterized by clashes between the military and rebel groups. Periods of relative calm are followed by periods of conflict fuelled by mine explosions, direct or indirect attacks, robberies and attacks on businesses or villages.

Rebel groups operate sporadically on roads (often closed at night) and in areas close to the borders with Gambia and Guinea Bissau. Anti-personnel and anti-tank mines, as well as unexploded explosive ordnance are found in many areas (North Sindian, Niassya, South Oussouye, Niaguis).

* Only travel overland during daytime
* Stay on the main roads
* Travel in a convoy when you can
* Hire reputable carriers or tour operators

Areas close to the borders with Mauritania and Mali, where jihadist groups are active, are at risk, as they may harbour external elements due to the porosity of the borders.

### Demonstrations and strikes

Strikes and demonstrations are common in larger cities. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Terrorism

Senegal has not suffered any recent terrorist attacks. However, in the context of the regional terrorist threat to West African countries, including Senegal, attacks could occur at any time.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

### Kidnapping

Kidnapping does not pose a significant risk in Senegal, but it cannot be ruled out since terrorist groups operating in neighbouring countries use this tactic. Be particularly vigilant in border areas.

### Hotel selection

Stay at hotels that have robust security measures, including:

* metal detectors
* guards
* security cameras

Keep in mind, however, that even the most secure locations are not completely free of risk.

### Dakar

Petty crime such as pickpocketing and bag snatching are sometimes committed by thieves on motorcycles. The Gorée pier is a favourite spot for pickpockets.

* Remain vigilant when travelling
* Ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Avoid displays of affluence

Don’t walk alone. Avoid walking along the Corniche road in the evening, especially on East Corniche (Petite Corniche) and on West Corniche. Avoid also lingering along the beach at the end of the day.

Home robberies and armed robberies occur frequently. In general, assaults take place early in the morning and after dusk.

### Demonstrations and strikes

Strikes and demonstrations are common in larger cities. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place

### Identification

You must carry photo identification, as well as a certified copy of your passport, as authorities may conduct identity checks at any time.

Keep a photocopy of your passport in a safe place, in case it is lost or confiscated.

### Road safety

Main roads are in good condition, but travel after dark can be difficult because of poor lighting. Most secondary roads require a four-wheel-drive vehicle, particularly in the rainy season.

Driving can also be dangerous due to:

* the presence of pedestrians and animals on the road
* bad driving habits
* poorly maintained vehicles

If you are involved in a road accident, stay at the scene and don’t move your vehicle until a police officer authorizes you to do so. However, if you do not feel safe or if there is a large crowd gathering, leave the scene and report to the nearest police station in order to avoid any conflict between the parties involved. The police may keep your documents for a few days, until the file is closed. It is therefore recommended that you carry certified photocopies that will be accepted by police.

* Avoid driving at night between cities
* Keep doors locked and windows closed
* Do not leave valuables in the vehicle

### Taxis

Taxis are often poorly maintained and the drivers may have poor driving habits.

* Use only officially marked taxis (yellow and black)
* Taxis do not have a meter. Negotiate fares in advance
* Avoid boarding a public transit vehicle if it appears to be overloaded or in poor condition

### The Grand Magal of Touba

The Grand Magal of Touba is an annual pilgrimage that attracts a large number of pilgrims each year.

The next event should take place on August 12, 2025.

Before and during the pilgrimage, you can expect:

* higher volumes of traffic
* street closures
* transportation delays
* limited available accommodations

Be alert at all times if you travel to Touba during the pilgrimage.

* offers you a business opportunity by email

* Only use reputable and professional guides or tour operators
* Closely follow park regulations and wardens’ advice
