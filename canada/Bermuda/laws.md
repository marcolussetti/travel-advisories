Canada and the United Kingdom are signatories to the European Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in the United Kingdom to request a transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both Canadian and British authorities.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs, including cannabis, are severe. Convicted offenders can expect jail sentences and heavy fines. If you’re caught with cannabis, you may be unable to leave the island until your legal case is resolved, which could take up to several months.

* Pack your luggage yourself
* Don’t carry items that do not belong to you

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and the United Kingdom.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Bermuda, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Bermudian court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Bermuda to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.
