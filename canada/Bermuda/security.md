# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs in public places, including on transportation networks and in tourist attractions. Incidents of theft from residences and vehicles have also increased, particularly in St. George’s.

* Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Avoid walking alone in isolated areas such as deserted beaches and back streets at night

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations may occur. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations
