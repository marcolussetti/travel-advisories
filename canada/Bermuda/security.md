## Safety and security

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, especially by thieves on motorcycles, occurs frequently. Thieves target tourists on motorcycles and at popular tourist attractions. They steal items left unattended in public areas, unsecured hotel rooms, and on rental motorcycles.

* Keep your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, in a secure place
* Avoid showing signs of affluence or wearing expensive jewellery
* Do not carry large sums of cash or valuables unnecessarily
* Be aware of your surroundings, especially in busy tourist areas
* Stay in accommodations with adequate security measures

#### Violent crime

Violent crime occurs sometimes, namely:

* muggings
* burglaries
* assaults
* shootings

Gang-related gun violence occurs in Bermuda. Tourists are not usually targeted, but you could be in the wrong place at the wrong time.

During your trip:

* exercise caution after dark
* avoid isolated areas such as deserted beaches and back streets
* pay attention to people walking behind you
* do not resist an attack

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations occur sometimes. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Water activities

Coastal waters can be dangerous, even for excellent swimmers. Coastal ocean currents are powerful and rip currents are common. Drownings occur every year.

Only some popular beaches have lifeguards, and they are only on duty during the high season, between May and October.

* Consult residents and tour operators for information on possible hazards, the presence of dangerous species and safe swimming areas
* Respect the areas reserved for swimming
* Monitor weather conditions
* Follow the instructions and warnings of local authorities

### Roads

#### Road safety

Fatal accidents, particularly involving motorcycles, are very frequent. Speed limits are low, but drivers often speed. Always drive defensively.

#### Road conditions

Road conditions are generally good, but they are often narrow, winding, and lack shoulders. Insufficient lighting outside urban areas can pose a danger.

### Public transportation

Safe taxi and bus services are widely available.

### Air travel

We don't make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.
