### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Rwanda.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Rwanda by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Rwanda to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

#### Insurance

Third-party insurance is required to cover damages if you are involved in an accident resulting in injuries even if you are not found to be at fault. If you are suspected of causing an accident, your driver’s licence can be confiscated during the investigation. If the accident results in death, you may be subject to a jail sentence.

### Money

The currency of Rwanda is the Rwandan franc (RWF).

Rwanda is a cash-based economy. Electronic payments and online banking are becoming more available. Credit cards are usually accepted at:

* most hotels and lodges
* most businesses, restaurants and shops in Kigali

ATMs are available in large cities. Some ATMs may not accept foreign bank cards, but you can make withdrawals at the bank counter, using your passport as identification. Expect to handle other expenses in cash.

Most shops will not accept or exchange U.S. dollars printed before 2006.
