# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Border with the Democratic Republic of Congo

The security situation at the border between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is unstable and unpredictable due to intensifying combat in North Kivu in the DRC, including around the city of Goma. Active fighting, including shelling, have been reported in Rubavu District. Escalating tensions between the DRC and Rwanda could further deteriorate the situation in Rubavu district.

The border crossings at Goma-Gisenyi could close without notice.

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and bag snatching, occurs.

Theft is frequent in:

* hotel rooms

During your trip to Rwanda:

* if you're being robbed, hand over cash, electronic devices and valuables without resistance

### Road safety

#### Road conditions

The road system is generally good and well maintained in Kigali and on main roads throughout the country. Outside of these areas, most roads are not paved, and driving can be dangerous due to:

* insufficient lighting
* lack of traffic signs

* poorly maintained vehicles

#### Driving habits

Drivers do not always respect traffic laws and sometimes drive at excessive speeds. However, speed cameras, present on all main roads, have reduced speeding frequency.

If you choose to drive in Rwanda:

* always drive defensively
* familiarize yourself with your itinerary before you leave
* avoid travelling after dark
* ask about insurance coverage options for roadside assistance when you rent a vehicle

Roadblocks are common throughout the country.

You may be asked for identification and your vehicle and luggage may be searched.
