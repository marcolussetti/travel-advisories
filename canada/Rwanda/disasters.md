## Natural disasters and climate

### Earthquakes

Rwanda is located in an active seismic zone.  However, earthquakes are not common.

### Volcanoes

There are several active and dormant volcanoes in and around Rwanda.

The Nyiragongo volcano, located near Goma DRC, is one of the world’s most active volcanoes. It may pose a threat in northwestern areas in Rwanda near the DRC border.

Past eruptions forced the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people, caused significant damage to infrastructure, and resulted in many casualties.

If you are travelling near an active volcano:

* exercise caution
* take official warnings seriously and respect exclusion zones
* monitor local media to stay up to date on latest developments and volcanic activity levels
* follow the advice of local authorities

### Rainy season

The rainy season extends from February to May and from September to December.

Seasonal flooding can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable and bridges damaged.

* Monitor local media for the latest updates, including those on road conditions
* Stay away from flooded areas
* Monitor weather reports
* Follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders
