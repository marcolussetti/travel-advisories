Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs. Incidents have been reported in:

* popular tourist areas, including Beau Vallon and Victoria
* beaches, including Cote d’Or beach
* unattended vehicles

* ATMs

During your trip to the Seychelles:

* ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and your other travel documents are secure at all times

### Adventure tourism

Outdoor activities, such as scuba diving, snorkelling, hiking and other adventure activities can be dangerous if unprepared. Trails are not always marked, and weather conditions can change rapidly.

If you intend to practice adventure tourism:

* consider traveling with a group and hiring an experienced guide from a reputable company
* obtain detailed information on your activity and on the environment in which you will be setting out
* avoid venturing off marked trails
* stay informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* refrain from using equipment if you have doubts on their safety

### Water activities

Coastal waters can be dangerous. Strong currents and riptides are common, particularly near the popular tourist beach in Beau Vallon. Several drownings occur each year.

Most beaches outside major hotels do not have a regular lifeguard present. When available, rescue services may not be consistent with international standards.

Beaches that offer safe swimming conditions from May to September, during the east monsoon period, may not be safe from December to March during the north-east monsoon period.

* Respect the areas reserved for swimming
* Always maintain a safe distance from boats and restricted areas
* Always respect warning flags advising of dangerous conditions
* Consult reputable sources and tour operators for information on possible hazards and safe swimming areas

#### Maritime excursions

Many isolated islands are accessible by boat or ferry. Travel by ship to the outer islands, such as Amirantes, Cosmoledo and Aldabra, requires the approval of the Seychelles Maritime Safety authority.

In stormy weather, travel by ship, including emergency travel, may be difficult.

While on maritime excursions:

* use only a reliable company
* make sure you have access to a lifejacket at all times
* do not board a boat that appears overloaded or unseaworthy

### Road safety

#### Road conditions

Roads are generally well maintained but are narrow and winding.

Driving can also be dangerous due to:

* the presence of animals, pedestrians, and bicycles on the road
* roads with sheer drops and lack of guardrails
* poorly lit roads

#### Driving habits

Impaired driving is prevalent in the Seychelles with a noted frequency of drivers operating vehicles while intoxicated by alcohol.

If you choose to drive in the Seychelles:

* drive defensively, particularly after dark
* in the event of a traffic accident, remain at the scene until the police arrive
* when returning a rented vehicle, ensure that you receive a written acknowledgement stating that the vehicle had not been damaged while in your possession
* purchase adequate car insurance

### Public transportation

#### Taxis

Taxis are available on the main Mahe and Praslin islands. Not all taxis are metered. In such cases, ensure that an agreed-upon fare is settled with the driver beforehand.

#### Buses

Public transportation by bus is available but limited on the main islands of Mahé and Praslin.

### Piracy

Pirate attacks and armed robbery against ships occur in coastal waters, particularly in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean. Though reports of piracy have decreased in recent years, mariners should take appropriate precautions.
