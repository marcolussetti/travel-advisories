# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Border with Angola

Peace in Angola has improved the security situation along the Namibia–Angola border. Due to the risk of banditry, however, you should exercise caution when travelling to this area, including Kavango Region in the northeast and the western half of Zambezi Region (formerly known as Caprivi). Use official border crossing areas only to enter neighbouring countries.

### Landmines

There are landmines in the border area from Katwitwi (a village on the Okavango River in Kavango West Region) to Kongola (a town in Zambezi Region).

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing, bag snatching and cellphone theft, occurs regularly.

Theft is frequent in:

* popular tourist areas
* crowded places, including urban shopping areas
* vehicles, especially unattended vehicles at gas stations and
* ATMs and surrouding areas

During your trip to Namibia:

* ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and your other travel documents, are secure at all times
* avoid showing signs of affluence or wearing expensive jewellery
* avoid carrying large sums of cash or unnecessary valuables
* never leave personal belongings unattended in a vehicle, even in the trunk
* be extra cautious when withdrawing cash from ATMs

#### Violent crime

Violent crime occurs, particularly in Windhoek. Incidents include :

* muggings
* burglaries
* carjackings

During your stay:

* avoid walking alone after dark
* keep your accommodations doors and windows locked at all times
* keep your car doors locked and windows closed, especially in heavy traffic

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations are rare and occur mostly in Windhoek. They can disrupt traffic and business.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Fraud

Cases of attempted fraud are frequently reported in Namibia.

Credit card copying in some hotels and lodges occurs. When paying by credit card, keep your card in view at all times. Be extra vigilant at ATMs, as criminals may attempt to distract you or offer assistance with the aim of stealing your money. Don’t accept any offer of assistance and cancel your transaction if you become suspicious.

* Pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others
* Use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business
* Avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* Cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* Check for any unauthorized transaction on your account statements

### Wildlife viewing

Wildlife viewing poses risks, particularly if you are on foot or at close range.

* Only use reputable and professional guides or tour operators
* Always maintain a safe distance when observing wildlife
* Only exit a vehicle when a professional guide or warden says it’s safe to do so
* Closely follow park and warden’s advice

### Road safety

Avoid night-time driving outside urban centres.

Be particularly careful when driving on rural roads, many of which are gravel with sloping sand shoulders.

Road conditions are generally good, but much of the country is covered by desert. Overland travel takes considerable time. Sand, salt and gravel roads become very slippery when wet.

Tourists are often involved in single-vehicle accidents. Do not exceed 80 km/h on gravel roads. Excessive speed and animals on the roadway pose hazards.

Emergency and roadside assistance is unreliable or non-existent outside Windhoek.

If you must travel overland via the Trans-Caprivi Highway between Rundu and Katima Mulilo, do so during daylight hours only.

Avoid stopping at roadside rest stops, where robberies have been known to occur.

If travelling to desert areas, do so with sufficient water and fuel supplies and two spare tires. Travel by convoy if you plan to go to the desert.

### Public transportation

Buses and taxis operate in the capital. Public transportation is limited outside Windhoek.

Foreigners have been robbed by taxi drivers. The Namibia Bus and Taxi Association (NABTA) regulates taxi drivers by allocating registration numbers (one letter followed by a two-digit number). Use registered taxis (displaying the NABTA logo) only or arrange for a taxi through a reputable hotel.

### Air travel

We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.
