# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

As of April 1, 2025, Canadian passport holders will require a visa to enter Namibia.

You can submit your visa application:

* online
* at Namibian embassies or consulates
* upon arrival at designated ports of entry, including Hosea Kutako International Airport.

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Namibian authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you use for travel.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for a minimum of 6 months after the date you enter Namibia.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Visas

Tourist visa: not required for stays up to 90 days  
Business visa: not required for stays up to 90 days  
Student visa: required  
Work visa: required

Namibian authorities require that your passport contains at least three blank pages to enter the country.

Make sure the entry stamp is valid for the duration of your stay (up to 90 days) and that immigration officials have given you a correctly dated entry stamp, as this will be checked upon departure.

Authorities are very strict regarding visa validity. Overstaying the time granted or having an incorrect or missing entry stamp could lead to detention, arrest and fines.
