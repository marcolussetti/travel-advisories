## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Transfer to a Canadian prison

Canada and the Netherlands are signatories to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in the Netherlands to request a transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both Canadian and the Netherlands authorities.

This process can take a long time, and there is no guarantee that the transfer will be approved by either or both sides.

### Drugs

Despite a common misconception, soft drugs like cannabis are controlled substances in the Netherlands. Some establishments, locally known as coffee shops, are allowed to sell soft drugs for personal use, but they must be licensed. Buyers must also be residents of the Netherlands.

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. You could face a jail sentence and heavy fines for:

* trafficking
* attempting to travel in or out of the Netherlands with soft drugs, even for personal use
* using drugs outside licensed establishments
* attempting to buy drugs at a licensed establishment if you’re not a resident of the Netherlands

### Knives

It’s illegal in the Netherlands to carry certain types of knives. These restrictions might be more severe in certain municipalities and public venues, such as restaurants and stadiums.

Avoid travelling with a knife.

### Identification

You must carry valid identification at all times if you are over 14. Local authorities may give you a fine if you fail to show them appropriate identification upon request.

The following documents, if valid, are acceptable identification:

* passports
* Dutch residence permits
* driver’s licence issued in the Netherlands or elsewhere in the European Union and the European Economic Area

Keep a photocopy of your passport in a safe place, in case it’s lost or confiscated.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in the Netherlands, with some exceptions.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of the Netherlands, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and the Netherlands.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in the Netherlands, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Netherlands court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in the Netherlands to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Driving

You must be at least 18 years old to drive a car in the Netherlands.

You should carry an international driving permit.

Traffic offences and parking violations can carry heavy, on-the-spot fines. If you are fined, always ask for a receipt.

### Money

The currency of the Netherlands is the euro (EUR).

Credit cards are not widely accepted. Make sure you have access to enough cash to cover expenses during your trip.

If you are carrying €10,000 or more, or the equivalent in other currencies or monetary instruments, you must make a declaration to customs when you enter or leave the European Union.

This does not apply if you are travelling within the European Union or in transit to a non-EU country.
