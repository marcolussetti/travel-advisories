## Safety and security

### NATO Summit

The NATO Summit will take place in The Hague June 24 to 25, 2025. Increased security measures will be in place in the period surrounding the summit in The Hague, particularly between Amsterdam Schiphol Airport and The Hague, Rotterdam and Amsterdam.

* Expect disruptions and road closures
* Allow plenty of time to reach your destination
* Avoid large crowds

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in Europe. Terrorists have carried out attacks in several European cities. Attacks in the Netherlands cannot be ruled out. Further attacks elsewhere in Europe are likely.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places. Be particularly vigilant if attending sporting events and during religious holidays and other public celebrations, as terrorists have used such occasions to mount attacks.

The Dutch government maintains a public alert system on terrorism and communicates threat level changes online and through local media. The current threat level for the Netherlands is level 4 (“substantial”) on a scale of 5.

### Crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and bag snatching, occurs, particularly in larger cities.

Thieves often target tourists. In Amsterdam, they are typically active:

* in restaurants and cafés
* in establishments that sell soft drugs, locally referred to as coffee shops
* at tourist attractions, including around the De Wallen District, also known as the red-light district
* at the Central Station
* on public transportation, particularly tram routes 1, 2, and 5, between Central Station and the museum district

Organized groups of pickpockets often use distracting techniques. Typically, a member of the group will distract someone by spilling something on them or by asking for directions, while others rob the victim.

Individuals posing as plain-clothes police officers have also approached foreigners to verify their documents or foreign currency with the intent to rob them. In a similar situation, politely decline to cooperate or offer to go to the nearest police station.

Thieves are very active on trains. They often strike while the train is at the station, so that they can escape quickly. There are regular cases of petty crime on international high-speed trains, including the Paris-Brussels-Amsterdam and London-Brussels-Amsterdam routes. Always be alert and cautious on trains.

Travellers have had their passports and other valuable documents stolen in hostels.

* Ensure that personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Do not carry valuables or large sums of money
* Never leave baggage or personal belongings unattended

Home burglaries occur, particularly in larger cities during the winter holiday period. Perpetrators monitor a property and break in when they know the residents are away.

Violent crime also occurs, including armed robbery. If you are the victim of such an incident, don’t resist. Attackers have sometimes assaulted their victims for failing to comply or not complying quickly enough.

#### Loss or theft of ID documents

In case of the loss or theft of an identification document:

* immediately report the incident to the nearest police station
* obtain a copy of the police report and keep it with you at all times
* apply for a replacement document as soon as possible

To file a police report, authorities in certain jurisdictions may require your passport or at least a copy. Before you go, make sure to bring a photocopy or a digital copy of your passport.

### Fraud

#### Credit card and ATM fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud occurs. Be cautious when using debit or credit cards:

* pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others
* use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

#### Cybercrime

Cybercrime occurs. Perpetrators may compromise public Wi-Fi networks to steal credit card or personal information.

* Avoid using public Wi-Fi networks
* Avoid making purchases on unencrypted websites
* Be cautious when posting information on social media
* Be particularly vigilant when contacting or meeting individuals known over the internet

### Spiked food and drinks

Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations take place frequently, particularly in major cities. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Road safety

Roads conditions and road safety are excellent throughout the country.

Be cautious when driving and keep the following in mind:

* cyclists have priority over other traffic
* trams have priority except where signposted at major junctions
* buses have priority when pulling out of bus stops
* unless otherwise signposted, vehicles coming from the right have priority

Whether you’re driving or on foot, pay attention to cyclists and when crossing bike paths. While on foot, make sure you’re not inadvertently walking on a bike path. These commonly run alongside sidewalks and are not always clearly marked.

Trams sometimes share pedestrian streets. Always be alert when walking near tram rails.

Pedestrians must follow the traffic lights at intersections. Even if it was safe to do so, you could be fined if you cross a road without waiting for the green light.
