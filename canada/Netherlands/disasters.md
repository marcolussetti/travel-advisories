## Natural disasters and climate

Flooding is a threat to coastal lands protected from the sea by dikes.

Along with flooding, strong winds can occur, particularly during the winter months. If severe wind storms are expected, the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute will issue national or regional warnings.
