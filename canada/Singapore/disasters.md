## Natural disasters and climate

### Typhoons and monsoon

The rainy (or monsoon) season extends from:

* December to March in the northeast
* June to September in the southeast

During this period, even small tropical storm can quickly develop into major typhoons. These severe storms can put you at risk.

These severe storms can put you at risk and slow down the provision of essential services.

If you decide to travel to Singapore during the typhoon season:

* know that you expose yourself to serious safety risks
* be prepared to change your travel plans on short notice, including cutting short or cancelling your trip
* keep up to date with the latest regional weather forecasts
* carry emergency contact information for your airline or tour operator
* follow the advice and instructions of local authorities
