# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs, particularly in the following locations:

* airports
* hotels
* public transportation facilities
* areas frequented by tourists

Ensure that your belongings, including passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times.

### Fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud occur. When you are using debit or credit cards:

* pay careful attention when other people are handling your cards
* use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements
* shop only at reputable establishments where prices are listed
* check prices before buying goods because some retailers charge foreigners exorbitant prices

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism. Terrorist attacks could occur at any time, and targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Singaporean security agencies are on high vigilance.

* Expect enhanced security measures and border checks
* Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places

### Demonstrations

All demonstrations and gatherings require a permit. Unauthorized demonstrations, even those involving one person, are illegal. The police can arrest, without warrant, any person involved in or suspected of disrupting the public order.

As a foreigner, you may require special permission to attend any demonstrations, even as an observer.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations, political or large gatherings are taking place, such as Speakers’ Corner in Hong Lim Park
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations
