## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Identification

Local police may ask to see your passport and visa at any time. They could detain you while they verify your identification documents.

* Carry adequate identification at all times

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect jail sentences, heavy fines or the death penalty.

Custom officers can subject travellers to a drug screening test at the point of entry to Singapore. If you test positive for drugs, you can be arrested and prosecuted, even if the drugs were consumed prior to your arrival in the country.

#### Alcohol

Consuming alcohol in public places between 10:30 p.m. and 7 a.m. is illegal.

In Liquor Control Zones, the alcohol ban is extended to all day on weekends. Local authorities may impose additional restrictions in these zones.

If you don't comply, you could face heavy fines and jail time.

### Common-law relationships

Common-law relationships are not recognized. If you are in a common-law relationship, you may have to provide proof to support the claim of your union by common-law to local authorities.

You may draft your own statutory declaration to proclaim your common-law relationship with another individual and request to notarize your declaration at the High Commission of Canada in Singapore. However, the High Commission cannot “certify” or “validate” your common-law relationship.

### Driving

Traffic drives on the left. You must carry an international driving permit.

If you reside in Singapore for more than 12 months, you must convert your valid Canadian driving licence to a Singapore Driving Licence.

Traffic regulations are strictly enforced.

Drinking and driving is a serious offence. Sentences can be up to 10 years in prison.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Singapore.

However, if you acquire two or more citizenships at birth, you can keep them all, including Singaporean citizenship, until the age of 21. At 21, local authorities may ask you to choose between your Singaporean citizenship or other citizenships.

If you're a citizen of Canada, but also a citizen of Singapore, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different entry or exit requirements, and other national obligations such as military service.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Singapore.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Singapore, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Singaporean court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Singapore to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.
