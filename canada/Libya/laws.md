Communications are closely monitored by the various armed groups and militias throughout Libya.

Journalists and activists are particularly at risk of surveillance by the authorities.

Extramarital relations, including sexual relations, are illegal, and convicted offenders are subject to severe penalties, including imprisonment and corporal punishment.

### Driving

If you have an accident, stay calm and contact the local police. In the event of a fatal or seriously damaging accident, local authorities may detain the drivers involved until the dispute is settled.

### Business disputes

Officials may confiscate your passport if you are involved in a business dispute.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Libya.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of Libya, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

[Dual citizens](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/documents/dual-citizenship)

Canadians of Libyan origin risk having their Canadian passports confiscated, lengthy interrogations, and difficulty leaving the country if they do not enter Libya on their Libyan passports.

### Family law

Regardless of parental marital status, children of Libyan fathers acquire Libyan citizenship at birth, and must enter and leave Libya on Libyan passports. Canadian mothers require their husbandâ€™s permission to take their Libyan children outside the country.

Child custody decisions are based on Islamic law.

It is extremely difficult for a Canadian woman, even if she is a Muslim, to obtain custody of her children through a court decision, unless she decides to stay in Libya.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Libya.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Libya by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Libya to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.
