# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism.

Extremist groups remain active throughout the country and generally target individuals and institutions associated with rival governments, as well as oil installations. Foreigners and people associated with Western countries are also targets of kidnapping and violence by terrorist groups.

The security forces of the rival governments of Tripoli and Benghazi regularly carry out anti-terrorist operations across the country.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools and foreign diplomatic representations
* places of worship
* airports, as well as other transportation hubs and networks
* checkpoints
* public places such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, cafés, shopping malls, markets, hotels and other places frequented by foreigners
* foreign representatives, diplomats, aid workers
* teachers and other private-sector workers

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

Be particularly vigilant during:

* sporting events
* religious holidays
* public celebrations
* major political events, such as elections

Terrorists may use such occasions to carry out attacks.

### Political situation

Despite progress towards elections and national reconciliation, the political situation remains extremely fragile. State institutions are divided between rival political groups, which complicates the provision of essential services to the population, particularly in terms of security.

A ceasefire agreement has been in force since 2020 between the rival governments of Tripoli and Benghazi and their affiliated militias. However, sporadic clashes between armed groups continue to occur in all parts of the country.

If you are in a conflict zone:

* carry emergency supplies, including food and water
* follow local and international media to stay informed about the security situation
* make sure your travel documents are valid
* follow the instructions of local authorities
* shelter in place until it is safe to leave the area

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations can occur at any time due to the precarious political and security situation. In the past, demonstrators have vandalized government buildings by setting them on fire. Even demonstrations that are intended to be peaceful can suddenly give rise to acts of violence. They can also greatly disrupt traffic and public transport.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Kidnapping

#### Border areas

Terrorist organizations, armed groups and militias are present in border regions, particularly in the south of the country, on the borders with Niger, Chad and Sudan. Kidnappings involving Westerners have occurred in the past. In most cases, the kidnappers demand a ransom in exchange for the hostages' release.

The border with Algeria is closed to travellers. Other borders may close at any time, notably those with Egypt and Tunisia.

It is forbidden to travel outside Tripoli without prior authorization from the Libyan authorities, except to cross the official border crossings to Egypt and Tunisia by land.   Without this authorization, you will be denied crossing at the various checkpoints.

### Crime

Libya has a very high crime rate.

The country's security is largely ensured by armed groups, some of which do not report to rival governments. These groups maintain law and order arbitrarily and finance their operations by engaging in criminal activities, such as:

* extortion
* carjacking
* armed robbery
* kidnapping for ransom
* arms trafficking

Weapons circulate in large quantities and are easily accessible throughout the country.

### Women's safety

Women can be subject to harassment and verbal abuse, especially when traveling alone. Sexual assaults on women and other gender-based violence are also common.

### Landmines

Despite demining operations, there is a high risk that unexploded ordnance or landmines may still be present throughout the country.

* Exercise caution, including in urban areas
* Stay on main and paved roads
* Avoid walking in fields
* Avoid roadside ditches, shoulders and unmarked paths
* Watch out for signs indicating the possible presence of landmines

### Road safety

Avoid overland travel in the south-east of the country due to the presence of landmines and the risk of kidnapping, banditry and terrorism.

It is dangerous to travel on the coastal highway in the west of the country, between Zawiyah and Tripoli, due to fighting between rival factions and the risk of kidnapping by extremist groups.

#### Road conditions

Road conditions vary considerably across the country. They are generally in good condition in major cities, but are dangerous in rural areas due to :

* insufficient lighting
* uneven surfaces
* poor road markings and lack of signage

In the desert, roads are unpaved and visibility can be reduced by sandstorms.

There may be fuel shortages and long queues at gas stations.

#### Driving habits

Road accidents are common. Vehicles are not always equipped with standard safety devices such as airbags and seatbelts. Drivers often break the traffic laws, notably by:

* driving at excessive speeds
* making sudden lane changes without signalling
* driving astride lanes
* stopping abruptly

If you drive in Libya:

* always drive defensively
* avoid driving at night
* use main roads and highways whenever possible
* always carry a cell phone and charger

### Public transport

The public transport network is not very well developed. Most transportation is by cab or bus.

If you choose to take a taxi in Libya :

* exercise caution
* never share it with strangers
* confirm the fare in advance
* bring cash for payment
