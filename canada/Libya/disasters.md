## Natural disasters and climate

### Climate change

Climate change is affecting Libya. Extreme and unusual weather events are becoming more frequent and may affect your travel plans. Monitor local media for the latest information.

Libya is prone to various natural disasters, such as:

* droughts
* heavy rains
* sand and dust storms
* earthquakes

Temperatures vary both geographically and seasonally. In the north, near the Mediterranean coast, summers are hot and dry, and winters are rainy. In the south, the climate is semi-arid, and it can get very hot in the Sahara, especially in summer. Between June and September, temperatures can exceed 40°C, and sand and dust storms are frequent.

### Drought

In the Sahara Desert, episodes of severe drought can last for several years, reducing the water supply.

During dry periods:

* plan accordingly
* always keep water supplies on hand
* follow the instructions of local authorities

### Rainy season

The rainy season generally extends from October to May. In the south, rainfall is much lower and less frequent due to the arid climate. In winter, coastal areas can experience episodes of heavy rain.

In 2023, excessive rainfall caused severe flooding in several coastal towns in northeastern Libya, including:

* Derna
* Benghazi
* Shahhat
* El-Beïda
* Soussa
* Al-Marj

Heavy rainfall led to the rupture of dams near the city of Derna, causing extensive damage to infrastructure and resulting in thousands of casualties.

* Monitor local media for the latest updates, including on road conditions
* Stay away from flooded areas
* Monitor weather reports
* Follow instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders

### Dust storms

Sand and dust storms are common.

During a dust storm :

* stay indoors
* keep windows closed
* be prepared to modify, interrupt or cancel your trip at any time
* check local media regularly for updates

### Earthquakes

Although Libya is not located in a high-risk zone for earthquakes, small tremors do occasionally occur.
