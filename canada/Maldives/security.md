## Safety and security

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism. Terrorist attacks could occur at any time. Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and resorts, and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations may occur. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Crime

#### Gang related violence

Populated areas such as Malé and Hulhumale may experience gang-related violence. Remain vigilant.

#### Petty Crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs. Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times, especially on the beach.

### Fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud occurs. Be cautious when using debit or credit cards:

* pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others
* use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

### Swimming

Coastal waters can be dangerous. Riptides are common. Several drownings occur each year.

#### Diving

Rescue services may not be consistent with international standards. There have been several diving injuries due to poor equipment and poor compliance to safety standards by local dive operators.

### Road safety

Only a few islands in the Maldives have the infrastructure for automobiles.

### Maritime transportation

Most transportation is by boat or seaplane. Motorized water taxis (dhonis) provide transportation between the airport, Malé and nearby resort islands.

### Air travel

We don't make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.
