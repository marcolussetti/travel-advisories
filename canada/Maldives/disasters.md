### Tsunamis

The Maldives are located in an active seismic zone and may be prone to earthquakes and tsunamis. A tsunami can occur within minutes of a nearby earthquake. However, the risk of tsunami can remain for several hours following the first tremor. If you’re staying on the coast, familiarize yourself with the region’s evacuation plans in the event of a tsunami warning.

### Monsoon

The rainy (monsoon) season extends from November to April in the northeast, and May to October in the southwest.

Keep informed of regional weather forecasts and plan accordingly.
