# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Mindanao island

Extremists have been active in the southern Philippines for several years.

Although local authorities have demobilized some of violent extremist groups in the recent years, there's still a risk of terrorist attacks and kidnappings, especially in the following regions:

* Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao
* Zamboanga Peninsula
* Sulu archipelago

Bombs causing deaths, injuries, and property destruction have exploded in public areas of major centres, including the cities of:

* Cotabato
* General Santos
* Isabela
* Jolo
* Kidapawan
* Marawi
* Zamboanga

Clashes may occur between insurgent groups and security forces.

There's a risk of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. The Government of Canada's ability to provide consular assistance is limited if you get stranded in this area.

If you chose to travel in the southern Philippines despite this advisory:

* remain indoors as much as possible
* be aware of your surroundings at all times
* avoid crowded places
* always travel with identification
* expect an increased security presence in public areas, especially around malls and transportation hubs
* stop at security checkpoints
* monitor local media
* follow the advice and instructions of local authorities

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in the southern Philippines.

In recent years, the Filippino government has intensified its fight against terrorists. Counterterrorism operations diminished the capacity of terrorist groups to operate in the Philippines. However, militants remain in the country even if attacks are less common.

Terrorist have carried out attacks, including in major cities and places visited by foreigners. Attacks are far more frequent in Western Mindanao, where government forces and rebel groups clash.

Further attacks may not be ruled out. Targets could include:

* government buildings, including military and police installations
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist destinations, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

Be particularly vigilant during the following:

* sporting events
* religious holidays
* public celebrations
* major political events, such as elections

Terrorists have used such occasions to mount attacks.

### Kidnapping

There is a threat of kidnapping across the country, including in Metro Manila. In coastal areas, criminals target individuals on private boats, in marinas and resorts. They have also kidnapped cargo vessel crews.

Kidnappings are usually for ransom, targeting both local and foreign nationals perceived to have money. Criminals have killed some victims.

While in the Philippines:

* maintain a high level of vigilance and personal security awareness at all times
* stay in reputable accommodation with adequate security measures
* report any suspicious behaviour to security forces
* if you are abducted, comply with the kidnappers' demands and do not resist

### Crime

Crime remains a serious concern throughout the country.

Violent crime, such as armed robbery, sexual assault, and murder, occur regularly. Gangs are active, including in Metro Manila.

The possession of guns and other weapons is common and poorly regulated. Arms trafficking is a significant problem throughout the country and criminals have attacked foreigners, even in wealthy neighbourhoods.

* Be aware of your surroundings at all times
* Avoid showing signs of affluence
* If threatened by robbers, don't resist

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing, swarming and bag snatching, occurs, especially in urban areas.

* Ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Be careful in crowded shopping malls and other public places
* Avoid carrying large sums of money
* Keep valuables in safe place
* Keep backpacks and bags away from traffic, as motorcyclists may grab them from pedestrians, sometimes causing injury
* Beware of friendly strangers offering to take you around town or on an excursion

### Spiked food and drinks

Some criminals have drugged and robbed tourists travelling alone after an invitation to visit a tourist attraction.

Snacks, beverages, gum and cigarettes may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

* Be wary of accepting these items from new acquaintances
* Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers

### Fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud occurs frequently. Illegal electronic devices are sometimes attached to ATM card readers, enabling them to record information such as the user's PIN.

Be cautious when using debit or credit cards:

* pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others
* use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

### Scams

#### Online financial scams

Internet is frequently used to initiate financial scams. Scammers often use fake profiles to target Westerners and steal from them. Once they succeed in building a virtual relationship, they ask for money for various purposes. This could include business or financial opportunities such as:

* money transfers
* lucrative sales
* gold purchase
* lotteries
* inheritance notices
* job offers
* bank overpayments

If you intend to do business in the Philippines:

* ensure that any business opportunity is legitimate before leaving
* don't travel to the Philippines with the intention to obtain restitution after losing money to a fraud

#### Internet romance

Internet romance is also common. Victims of this type of scams have lost thousands of dollars. Before travelling to the Philippines to visit someone you met online:

* keep in mind that you may be the victim of a scam
* inform yourself about the country's customs and laws on conjugal relations and marriage
* be sure to retain possession of your return plane ticket, money, and passport

#### Child abuse

Locals with children may befriend single male tourists and then accuse them of child abuse to extort money from them.

Report any incident of crime or scams to local police before you leave the country.

### Women's safety

Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations take place, including in Manila. Clashes may occur between security forces and demonstrators, especially in Mindanao and remote areas of northern Luzon.

Filipino law prohibits political activities by foreigners. Participating in demonstrations may result in being detained or deported.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Water activities

Coastal waters can be dangerous. Riptides are common. Several drownings occur each year.

Most of the time, lifeguards are not present to supervise swimmers. Many beaches don't offer warnings of dangerous conditions.

Water pollution is also a concern.

* Seek local advice before swimming
* Avoid swimming if red flags are flown

#### Scuba diving

Diving schools and rescue services may not adhere to Canadian standards.

* Use only reputable dive companies
* Make sure the company offers proper safety equipment

### Road safety

#### Road conditions

Road conditions vary throughout the country. Some roads, including major highways, are poorly maintained. Traffic is very heavy, especially in Metro Manila.

Driving conditions may quickly become hazardous. During the rainy season, metro centres often become impassable due to flash floods.

#### Driving habits

Many drivers don't respect traffic laws. They are reckless. They often drive at excessive speeds or way below the speed limit on highways. Accidents causing fatalities are common. Pedestrians don't have priority over cars.

Even minor road incidents can escalate quickly and lead to violent assaults.

If driving in the Philippines:

* avoid travel outside urban areas or tourist centres after dark
* stay on national highways and paved roads
* avoid any confrontation

#### Scooters

Most people travel using mopeds. Fatal scooter accidents involving tourists are common.

If renting a scooter or moped:

* be vigilant while driving
* avoid renting from operators who don't provide a helmet with the rental
* avoid driving on roads in disrepair

### Public transportation

The safety and reliability of public transportation are poor.

#### Buses

Minibuses, known as jeepneys, and large buses are often old, poorly maintained, and overcrowded. Pickpocketing and armed robberies are frequent, especially in large cities such as Manila and Cebu.

Some interurban buses have also been involved in fatal accidents.

#### Motorcycles

Motorcycle transportation is prevalent throughout the country, whether by habal-habal or tricycle.

Habal-habal are motorcycles with extensions, which can carry several passengers at a time. They are illegal and dangerous.

Tricycles are rather a safe option as they don't drive very fast. However, vehicles may be in poor condition. They aren't metered and can be hailed anywhere.

* Don't use habal-habal
* Avoid using tricycles at night on country roads
* Agree on a fare with the tricycle driver before departing to avoid scams

#### Taxis

Although most taxi services are safe and reliable, there have been extortion incidents from taxi drivers.

To minimize your risks:

* avoid hailing a taxi on the street
* only enter metered taxis from a reliable company and insist the meter be turned on
* prefer hotel transportation, official airport taxis, or a ridesharing app
* never share taxis with strangers
* ask for the windows being rolled up and doors locked at all times
* never hand your phone to the driver to allow them to see the map
* record the taxi's licence plate and provide the information to a relative/friend

#### Ferry

Ferry accidents occur. Some vessels are poorly maintained and overcrowded. Accidents are more prevalent during the rainy season as storms can develop quickly. As a result, local authorities may suspend ferry services on short notice when a storm signal is raised, even if the weather is clear. You could get stranded at ports for several days.

If travelling by sea:

* use only a reliable company
* don't board vessels that appear overloaded or unseaworthy
* make sure you have access to a life jacket
* plan for extra time, especially during the rainy season

### Piracy

Pirate attacks and armed robbery targeting ships occur in coastal waters. You may face an elevated threat of kidnapping in waters:

* around Mindanao
* in the Sulu Sea
* in the Celebes Sea
* south of Palawan Island
* south of Negros Island
* around Siquijor Island

Mariners should take appropriate precautions.
