### Climate change

Climate change is affecting the Philippines. Extreme and unusual weather events are becoming more frequent. Monitor local news to stay informed on the current situation.

### Typhoons and monsoons

The rainy or monsoon season extends from May to November, but storms can occur throughout the year. The Philippines experiences around 20 typhoons per year, mostly between June and November.

Seasonal flooding can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable and bridges damaged. Flooding and mudslides are frequent following heavy rains, even in Metro Manila.

If you decide to travel to the Philippines during the rainy season:

* know that you expose yourself to serious safety risks
* be prepared to change your travel plans on short notice, including cutting short or cancelling your trip
* stay informed of the latest regional weather forecasts
* carry emergency contact information for your airline or tour operator
* follow the advice and instructions of local authorities

### Seismic activity

The Philippines is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and experiences regular seismic activity.

#### Volcanoes

There are several active and potentially active volcanoes in the Philippines, mainly on Luzon island.

Taal is one of the main active volcanoes in Batangas on Luzon Island. It continuously shows signs of a possible eruption. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology is constantly monitoring the Taal Volcano. Local authorities may raise alert levels and issue evacuation orders on short notice.

Volcanic activity may escalate suddenly. Volcanic ash clouds may cause disruptions to domestic and international flights.

If you are near active volcanoes:

* monitor levels of volcanic activity through the local media
* pay careful attention to all warnings issued
* follow the advice of local authorities, including evacuation orders
* be prepared to modify your travel arrangements or even evacuate the area on short notice

#### Earthquakes

The Philippines is located in an active seismic zone. Earthquakes occur regularly and strong aftershocks may occur after the initial quake.

Familiarize yourself with earthquake security measures in public and private buildings, including airports.

#### Tsunamis

The Philippines is prone to tsunamis.

A tsunami can occur within minutes of a nearby earthquake. However, the risk of a tsunami can remain for several hours following the first tremor.

If you're staying on the coast, familiarize yourself with the region's evacuation plans in the event of a tsunami warning.
