## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use, trafficking or importation, including through e-commerce, of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect life imprisonment and heavy fines.

Many drugs considered as legal in Canada are illegal in the Philippines. This includes cannabis, regardless of quantity and purpose of use, as well as some over-the-counter medicine and prescription drugs.

* Pack your own luggage and monitor it closely at all times
* Never transport other people's packages, bags or suitcases

### Child sex tourism

Penalties for pedophilia are severe. Under Philippine law, a child is defined as a person under 18.

Police may investigate any adult who is with:

* an unrelated child 12 years of age or younger, or 10 years or more his/her junior
* an unrelated child under age 18 inside the room of a house, hotel, or other similar establishments, vehicle, or other secluded location, and is suspected of having the intention to exploit the child sexually

### Boracay Island

To protect the environment, local authorities restrict access to Boracay Island.

Some activities are also prohibited, including the consumption of alcohol and tobacco in public places, including White Beach.

If you plan to visit Boracay, make sure you know about the rules and regulations before leaving.

### Demonstrations

Filipino law prohibits political activities by foreigners.

Attending any protest, demonstration, or political rally as a foreign national may lead to detention and deportation.

### Identification

Authorities may request to see your ID at any time.

* Carry valid identification at all times
* Keep a photocopy of your passport in case it's lost or seized
* Keep a digital copy of your ID and travel documents

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in the Philippines.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of the Philippines, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

[Dual citizens](http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/documents/dual-citizenship)

Dual citizens must obtain a certificate of recognition from Philippine authorities to ensure the legal recognition of both citizenships.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and the Philippines.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in the Philippines by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in the Philippines to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.
