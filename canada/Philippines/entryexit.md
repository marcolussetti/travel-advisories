# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Philippine authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you use for travel.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid at least 6 months beyond the date you expect to leave the Philippines.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Visas

Tourist visa: not required for stays of up to 30 days  
Business visa: not required for stays of up to 30 days  
Student visa: required

If you need to extend your stay above the 30-day visa-free period, you must get the proper authorization from local authorities before this period ends.

The visa that immigration officials issue upon your arrival in the Philippines takes precedence over any visa you may have obtained from a Philippine embassy or consulate abroad.

If you're leaving the Philippines using a temporary passport issued inside the country, consult the Philippine Bureau of Immigration to obtain the required exit stamps.

#### Emigration clearance certificate

If you've been in the country for 6 months or more, you must obtain an emigration clearance certificate (ECC), also known as an exit clearance, and pay applicable fees at least 72 hours before your expected departure.

This also applies to children born in the Philippines who are leaving the country for the first time on a foreign passport.
