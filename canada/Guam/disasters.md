## Natural disasters and climate

### Climate change

Climate change is affecting Guam. Extreme and unusual weather events are becoming more frequent and may affect your travel plans. Monitor local media for the latest information. 

### Typhoons

Typhoons usually occur between July and December. During this period, even small storms can quickly develop into major typhoons. These severe storms can put you at risk and hamper the provision of essential services.

If you decide to travel to Guam during the typhoon season:

* know that you may expose yourself to serious safety risks
* be prepared to change your travel plans on short notice, including cutting short or cancelling your trip
* stay informed of the latest regional weather forecasts
* carry emergency contact information for your airline or tour operator
* follow the advice and instructions of local authorities

Since May 2023, following Typhoon Mawar, Guam Waterworks Authority has advised residents in certain areas to boil their water due to possible bacterial contamination.

### Earthquakes and tsunamis

Guam is in an active seismic zone. Earthquakes and tsunamis may occur.

A tsunami can occur within minutes of a nearby earthquake. However, the risk of tsunami can remain for several hours following the first tremor. If you're staying on the coast, familiarize yourself with the region's evacuation plans in the event of a tsunami warning.
