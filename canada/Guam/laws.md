### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Guam.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Guam, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Guamanian court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Guam to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

The currency in Guam is the U.S. dollar (USD).

There’s no limit to the amount of money that you may legally take into or out of the territory. However, you must submit a declaration to U.S. Customs and Border Protection:

* if you carry more than US$10,000 (in cash, cheque, money order, travellers’ cheque or any other convertible asset) into or out of Guam
* if you plan to receive more than US$10,000 while in Guam

Failure to comply can result in civil and criminal penalties, including seizure of the currency or monetary instruments.
