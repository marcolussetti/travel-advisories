## Safety and security

### Crime

The crime rate is very low in Martinique. Petty crime poses the most significant threat.

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and bag-snatching, occurs, mainly in Fort-de-France and its port. Thefts from cars may also occur.

* Avoid deserted beaches and isolated areas after dark
* Don’t walk alone at night
* Don’t carry large amounts of cash or wear expensive jewellery
* Ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Never leave personal belongings, such as money, credit cards, cell phones and other electronics, unattended, especially on beaches

### Fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud may occur. Be cautious when using debit or credit cards:

* pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others
* use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

### Demonstrations and strikes

Demonstrations and labour strikes occur from time to time. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Water activities

Coastal waters can be dangerous.

* Exercise caution when swimming

### Hiking

If you intend on hiking:

* never do so alone and always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* ensure that you’re properly equipped and well informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary, including when you expect to be back to camp
* obtain detailed information on trekking routes before setting out and do not venture off marked trails

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety are very good throughout the island.

Roads are well maintained although some may still require repair following the passage of hurricane Maria in 2017.  Some roads may be narrow and winding. Night driving can be dangerous, especially in the mountains and on rural roads.

### Public transportation

#### Buses

Bus services are safe. Both urban and inter-city bus transportation is available.

#### Taxis

Taxis are safe but expensive. By law, they must be metered.

#### Ferries

Ferry services provide transportation mainly to Guadeloupe, Dominica and St Lucia.

### Cruises

Fort-de-France is a cruise ship stop.
