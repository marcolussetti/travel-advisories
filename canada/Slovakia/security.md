# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs, especially in crowded areas and particularly during summer months. Foreigners are often targeted.

Pickpockets often work in teams, sometimes including children, and target people on trains and at railway stations and airports. Their methods include distracting a victim who is boarding or exiting a train or surrounding a victim in line-ups or at check-out counters.

Always be suspicious if someone offers to help you with a flat tire. These individuals may have punctured the tire themselves and seize the opportunity to steal a bag or other valuable objects while you are distracted.

Individuals have also been harassed for reasons of race or foreign-looking appearance.

Terrorists may use such occasions to mount attacks.

### Fraudulent police officers

Individuals posing as plainclothes police officers may ask to see your foreign currency and passport. If approached, decline to hand over personal belongings. Offer instead to go to the nearest police station or seek assistance from a local contact.

### Spiked food and drinks

Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as these items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations occur sometimes.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Roads

Road conditions and road safety can vary greatly throughout the country. Driving conditions may be hazardous during winter.

Drivers do not respect traffic laws. They often drive at excessive speeds and use reckless manoeuvring.

Avoid travelling after dark in remote areas.

### Public transportation

Public transportation is well developed and reliable.

#### Taxis

Officially marked taxis are generally reliable, safe and economical. Beware of taxi drivers who try to overcharge by not switching on the meter. Pre-negotiate the fare.
