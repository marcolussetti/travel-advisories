## Safety and security

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs, especially in crowded areas and particularly during summer months. Thieves target tourists.

Criminals, including groups of children and teenagers, use various techniques to distract their victims, especially on public transportation and at train stations. Car theft and theft from inside cars occurs, particularly with rental and luxury cars.

Theft occurs in crowded public areas such as:

* popular tourist areas, including lookouts
* buses, trains, bus and train stations, and airports
* hotel lobbies
* restaurants, including outdoor seating areas

Thieves are active in Bratislava’s Old Town area.

During your trip:

* keep your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, in a secure place and out of sight
* never leave personal belongings unattended in a vehicle, even in the trunk
* park your vehicle in a secure area
* do not carry large sums of cash or valuables unnecessarily
* avoid isolated areas
* be aware of your surroundings, especially in busy tourist areas

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in Europe. Terrorists have carried out attacks in several European cities and further attacks are likely.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including police stations
* schools, including universities
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners
* cultural venues

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

Be particularly vigilant during:

* sporting events
* religious holidays
* public celebrations
* major political events, such as elections

Terrorists may use such occasions to mount attacks.

### Fraud

#### Overcharging

Certain establishments, such as bars or nightclubs, may try to overcharge you.

Discussions about overcharging have turned violent. Tourists have been threatened and forced to pay the bill.

* Always confirm the price of an item before ordering
* Do not leave an open tab
* Avoid giving your credit card to bar or restaurant staff
* Check the accuracy of your bill before paying

Women, 2SLGBTQI+ persons and racialized groups, have been subject to harassment or verbal abuse.

Be vigilant when travelling alone, especially at night. If you are the victim of harassment, you should report it immediately to the police.

### Spiked food, drinks and other items

Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as these items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations occur sometimes. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Adventure tourism

Outdoor activities, such as hiking, climbing, skiing, and other extreme sports, can be dangerous.

Weather conditions can change rapidly, even in the summer. Lightning strikes are particularly common in the Tatra region of the Carpathians, as well as a risk of sudden storms and avalanches.

If you intend to participate in adventure tourism activities:

* share your itinerary with a friend or family member if you’re alone
* obtain detailed information on your activity and the environment in which you will be setting out
* buy travel insurance that covers incidents related to this type of recreational activity
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to tackle the challenges of your activity
* ensure that you have proper equipment and bring sufficient water
* monitor weather conditions and other possible hazards

### Roads

#### Road conditions

Road conditions vary greatly throughout the country.

Driving conditions may be hazardous during winter and in rural areas due to poorly lit roads.

Drivers don’t always respect traffic laws. Speeding is common, and drivers can be aggressive and reckless.

If you choose to drive:

* plan your trip in advance, especially if you are visiting a rural area
* familiarize yourself with your itinerary before you leave
* avoid travelling after dark, especially in remote areas
