## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Transfer to a Canadian prison

Canada and Slovakia are signatories to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in Slovakia to request a transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both Canadian and Slovak authorities.

This process can take a long time, and there is no guarantee that the transfer will be approved by either or both sides.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs, including cannabis, are severe. Convicted offenders can expect lengthy jail sentences.

Public intoxication and disorderly conduct are illegal. Offenders could be severely fined or detained.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Slovakia.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Slovakia, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Slovakia.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Slovakia, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Slovak court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Slovakia to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.
