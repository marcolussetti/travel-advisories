### National parks

Protected areas of national parks are safeguarded by Chilean legislation. Penalties for violations can be severe, especially in the case of fires.

Open fires are strictly forbidden in national parks outside permitted camping areas. This includes burners for cooking purposes.

Local authorities may revoke your tourist card if you’re caught starting a fire illegally. They may ask you to depart Chile within 72 hours or you may be subjected to deportation proceedings. You may also face detention and heavy fines if the open fire results in a forest fire.

* Respect protected areas, even if there are no warnings or signs to this effect
* Ensure you have a good understanding of local rules and regulations before entering national parks

Heritage areas are safeguarded by Chilean legislation. Penalties for violations can be severe, from payment of a fine to imprisonment. If you are detained for breaching the rules of a heritage site, local authorities may prevent you from leaving the country during the investigation.

* Ensure you have a good understanding of local site rules and regulations
* Don’t alter landmarks in any way

### Importation of agricultural products

Chile imposes severe restrictions on the importation of agricultural products, such as food and animal products.

### Driving

You can drive with your valid Canadian driver’s licence for up to 90 days. However, you should still carry an international driving permit. If you’re a resident of Chile, you must apply for a Chilean driver’s licence from the municipality in which you live.

The country has a zero-tolerance policy for drinking and driving. Penalties include:

* licence suspension
* fines
* detention

Right turns at red lights are prohibited, unless otherwise posted.

Some car rental companies may not allow for international trips. If you intend to travel outside the country in a rental vehicle:

* make sure the rental company allows it before making your reservation
* request written authorization from the car rental company 3 to 5 days before your trip

#### Insurance

Some insurance companies might not cover pickup truck rentals or have exclusions related to damage caused on unpaved roads.

There is no car insurance available on Easter Island. In case of accident or damage to your rented vehicle, you will have to pay for the repairs yourself.

#### Restrictions in Santiago

To combat high levels of pollution in the winter, restrictions on driving in central Santiago, within the Américo Vespucio ring road, are in place from May to September.

Vehicles with a green seal registered before September 1, 2011, are subject to a daily restriction based on the last two digits of the licence plate. When there is an alert, restrictions are in effect from Monday to Friday between 7:30 am and 9 pm.

If a pre-emergency or environmental emergency is decreed, additional digits could be restricted.

You can check the list of affected plate numbers in newspapers and online.

### Political activities

Chilean law prohibits political activities by foreigners. Participating in demonstrations or promoting dissent, including on social media, may result in you being detained and/or deported.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Chilean law does not prohibit sexual acts between individuals of the same sex.

While homosexuality is generally tolerated, Chilean society remains fairly conservative. 2SLGBTQI+ persons could be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression or sex characteristics.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Chile.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Chile, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Chile.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Chile, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Chilean court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Chile to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

The currency of Chile is the Chilean peso (CLP).

Some small restaurants and stores outside Santiago may not accept credit cards.

U.S. dollars are easily exchanged at banks and official foreign exchange bureaus across the country. However, purchases in U.S. dollars can only be made in certain stores in Santiago.
