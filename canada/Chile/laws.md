### National parks

Protected areas of national parks are safeguarded by Chilean legislation. Penalties for violations can be severe, especially in the case of fires.

Open fires are strictly forbidden in national parks outside permitted camping areas. This includes burner for cooking purposes.

Local authorities may revoke your tourist permit if you’re caught starting a fire illegally. They may ask you to depart Chile within 72 hours or be subjected to deportation proceedings. You may also face detention and heavy fines if the open fire results in forest fire.

### Driving

You can drive with your Canadian driver’s licence for up to 90 days. However, you should still carry an international driving permit. If you are a resident of Chile, you must apply for a Chilean driver’s licence from the municipality in which you live.

The country has a zero-tolerance policy for drinking and driving. Penalties for drinking and driving include licence suspension, fines and detention.

Right turns at red lights are prohibited, unless otherwise posted.

Some car rental companies may not allow for international trips. If you intend to travel outside the country in a rental vehicle:

#### Insurances

Some insurance companies might not cover pick-up truck rental or have exclusion related to damages caused on unpaved roads.

There is no car insurance available on Easter Island. In case of accident or damage to your rented vehicle, you will have to pay for the repairs yourself.

#### Restrictions in Santiago

To combat high levels of pollution in winter, restrictions on driving in central Santiago, within the Américo Vespucio ring road, are in place from May to September.

Vehicles with a green seal registered before September 1, 2011 are subject to a daily restriction based on the last two digits of the license plate. Restrictions are in effect:

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Chilean law does not prohibit sexual acts between individuals of the same sex.

While homosexuality is generally tolerated, Chilean society remains fairly conservative. 2SLGBTQI+ persons could be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression or sex characteristics.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Chile.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Chile, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Chilean court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Chile to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.
