## Natural disasters and climate

### Wildfires in central Chile

Wildfires are burning in central Chile. Evacuation orders and warnings are in effect for multiple areas, including:

* Ranquil, in Ñuble region
* In Biobío region:

+ Conception
+ Penco
+ Tomé
+ Halqui
+ Quillon

Road closures and poor visibility due to smoke are affecting travel. Air quality is significantly degraded in fire-affected zones.

Stay away from impacted regions. If you are near a wildfire:

* follow the instructions of local emergency services personnel, including evacuation orders
* monitor local media for up-to-date information on the situation

Chile is subject to various natural disasters such as:

* volcanic eruptions
* earthquakes and tsunamis
* torrential rains, floods and mudslides
* wildfires
* coastal swells
* tornadoes

Border crossings can close due to severe weather conditions.

### Volcanoes

There are 500 active volcanoes in Chile. Local authorities closely monitor the following volcanoes:

* Villarica
* Osorno
* Llaima
* Calbuco
* Grupo Descabezados

Debris from erupting volcanoes can clog rivers and cause them to overflow, resulting in flash floods and landslides. Ash clouds may also cause disruptions to domestic and international flights.

If you’re travelling near active volcanoes:

* monitor levels of volcanic activity through the local media
* pay careful attention to all warnings issued
* follow the instructions of local authorities
* be prepared to modify your travel arrangements or even evacuate the area on short notice

### Earthquakes and tsunamis

Chile is located in a very active seismic zone. Earthquakes and tsunamis can occur anywhere throughout the country.

A tsunami can occur within minutes of a nearby earthquake. However, the risk of a tsunami can remain for several hours following the first tremor. If you're staying on the coast, familiarize yourself with the region's evacuation plans in the event of a tsunami warning.

In the event of an earthquake or tsunami:

* monitor local media for the latest information
* follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders

### Torrential rains, flooding and mudslides

Flooding is frequent during the fall and the winter, especially between May and August. It occurs throughout the country, mainly as a result of heavy rains and overloaded sewage systems. Seasonal flooding can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable and bridges damaged.

Flooding from rising river levels after heavy rain can cause injuries and deaths.

Avoid riverside accommodations, especially in central and southern Chile, because dry riverbeds swell rapidly.

### Coastal swells

Dangerous waves caused by large ocean swells occur along the Chilean coast. Large waves carrying rocks and other debris can occur without warning and even when the weather is clear.

If you plan to travel near the coast:

* monitor local swell reports
* exercise caution in coastal and rocky areas
* do not enter the ocean or engage in water activities when swell warnings are in force

### Wildfires

Bush and forest fires are common during the summer months, from December to March. They can happen anywhere, but they usually occur between Santiago and Valparaíso, and in Magallanes.

Heavy smoke may deteriorate the air quality in areas near active fires.

In case of a major fire:

* stay away from affected areas, particularly if you suffer from respiratory ailments
* monitor local media for the latest information
* follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders

### Air pollution

Santiago is one of the most polluted cities in South America. Heavy smog can pose serious health hazards from May to October.

The ozone layer is especially thin over parts of Chile.

Take precautions to protect yourself from sunburn and avoid going outdoors when the pollution levels are high.
