### Seismic activity

Chile is located in a very active seismic zone.

#### Volcanoes

There are 500 active volcanoes in Chile.

Debris from erupting volcanoes can clog rivers and cause them to overflow, resulting in flash floods and landslides. Ash clouds may also cause disruptions to domestic and international flights.

If you are travelling near active volcanoes:

* monitor levels of volcanic activity through the local media
* pay careful attention to all warnings issued
* follow the advice of local authorities
* be prepared to modify your travel arrangements or even evacuate the area on short notice

#### Earthquakes and tsunamis

Earthquakes and tsunamis can occur anywhere throughout Chile.

A tsunami can occur within minutes of a nearby earthquake. However, the risk of tsunami can remain for several hours following the first tremor. If you're staying on the coast, familiarize yourself with the region's evacuation plans in the event of a tsunami warning.

In the event of an earthquake or tsunami:

* monitor local news for to stay informed on the evolving situation
* follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders

### Flooding

Flooding is frequent during fall and winter, especially between May and August. It occurs throughout the country, mainly as a result of heavy rains and overloaded sewage systems. Seasonal flooding can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable and bridges damaged.

Flooding from rising river levels after heavy rain cause injuries and deaths.

Avoid riverside accommodations, especially in central and southern Chile, as dry riverbeds swell rapidly.

### Coastal swell

Dangerous waves caused by large ocean swells occur along the Chilean coast. Large waves carrying rocks and other debris can occur without warning and even when the local weather is clear.

If you plan to travel near the coast:

* monitor local swell reports
* exercise caution in coastal and rocky areas
* do not enter the ocean or engage in boating or water activities when swell warnings are in force

### Wildfires

Bush and forest fires are common during the summer months. They can happen anywhere, but they usually occur between Santiago and Valparaíso, and in Magallanes.

The air quality in areas near active fires may deteriorate due to heavy smoke.

In case of a major fire:

* stay away from affected areas, particularly if you suffer from respiratory ailments
* follow the advice of local emergency services personnel
* monitor local media for up-to-date information on the situation

Santiago has one of the highest pollution levels in South America. Heavy smog can pose serious health hazards from May through October.

The ozone layer is especially thin over parts of Chile.

Take precautions to protect yourself from sunburn.
