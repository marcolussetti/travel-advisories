# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from Chilean authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

Chile has strict entry and exit requirements, especially for dual citizens and children.

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for the duration of your stay in Chile.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Tourist card

You must keep the card and present it to immigration officers upon departure from the country. Failure to do so may result in delays.

#### Replacing a tourist card

If your card is lost or stolen, you may obtain a new one online.

Alternatively, you may go, well in advance of departure:

### Dual citizenship

Canadian-Chilean dual citizens residing in Chile must enter and depart the country using their Chilean passport.

Canadian-Chilean dual citizens travelling to Chile on their Canadian passport must request an extension of stay if they decide to stay longer than 90 days. They may have to depart the country on a Chilean passport if they fail to do so.

### Children and travel

Chile has strict requirements for the entry and exit of persons under the age of 18, including special documentation. Children travelling with only one parent, with a guardian or alone, are required to carry:

* a notarized, apostilled and translated letter of authorization from the other parent or a court
* the child’s apostilled long-form birth certificate

For more information on these requirements, contact the nearest Chilean embassy or consulate before travelling to Chile. If you’re already in Chile, contact a local Chilean notary public.
