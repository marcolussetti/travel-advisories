## Safety and security

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing, bag snatching and theft from vehicles, can occur in any part of the country. However, you should remain especially vigilant in larger cities such as:

* Santiago
* Valparaíso / Viña del Mar
* Calama
* Concepción
* Villarica
* Iquique

Theft occurs frequently in:

* popular tourist areas, including lookouts
* bus and train stations and airports
* the subway in Santiago
* shopping malls
* hotel lobbies
* restaurants, including patios located near streets
* gas stations and highway service centres

These types of crimes are often carried out using distraction. Pickpockets and bag snatchers work in pairs or groups and use a variety of ruses to divert their victim’s attention. In some cases, thieves on foot work with thieves on motorcycles, “motochorros,” to snatch purses, cell phones and backpacks.

In Valparaíso and Santiago, thieves target rental cars. They puncture the tire of a vehicle, then steal items when the occupants get out to check the tire.

Another distraction technique involves spilling a substance on victims and then robbing them while pretending to help clean the stain.

During your trip:

* be suspicious of strangers approaching you, because they may attempt to distract and rob you
* do not use your cell phone while walking on the street
* keep bags and purses on your lap instead of on the table or hung on chairs
* keep your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, in a secure place
* keep a copy of your identification or passport with you
* do not carry large sums of cash
* avoid showing signs of affluence or wearing expensive jewellery

On the road:

* do not leave valuables within reach or in plain sight
* keep doors and windows closed and locked at all times
* do not leave personal belongings unattended in a vehicle, even in the trunk

#### Violent crime

Armed assaults and robberies have increased in recent years. Tourists have been attacked, even during the daytime. Be particularly careful and avoid walking after dark in the following areas:

* around Cerro Alegre and other cerros (hills) in Valparaíso
* in Cerro San Cristóbal park, north of Santiago
* in Santiago:

+ in parks
+ in the Bellavista and Barrio Lastarria neighbourhoods
+ at Cerro Santa Lucia
+ in common tourist areas, such as Plaza de Armas and Mercado Central

Carjackings occur, including as drivers leave their vehicles to open or close gates or wait for gates to open or close.

* Always be aware of your surroundings
* If you’re threatened, hand over your cash and valuables without resistance

Residential break-ins are becoming increasingly common, especially in larger cities when properties are unoccupied.

* Keep doors and windows closed and locked at all times

* Keep your personal belongings in a secure place

#### Express kidnappings

Express kidnappings, where kidnappers demand immediate ransoms, occur occasionally.

Criminals kidnap the victim from the street or a taxi and force the person to withdraw funds from an ATM or transfer funds online. The victim is sometimes held overnight so that a second withdrawal can be made the next day.

These kidnappings occur throughout the country and are often committed by organized gangs, but they can also be committed by taxi drivers.

* Only use reputable taxi companies or ride-sharing applications

* Avoid hailing taxis on the street

* If you're threatened by armed criminals, stay calm and do not resist
* Do not accept rides from new acquaintances or strangers

#### Araucanía and Biobío regions

There has been politically motivated violence in some parts of the Araucanía and Biobío regions of southern Chile. In 2022, the Government of Chile declared a state of emergency in the area, which is re-evaluated every 30 days.

Violent protests, barricades, looting, arson attacks and fatal shootings have occurred. Exercise caution if you’re travelling in these regions.

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism. Explosions of small-scale devices occasionally occur in Santiago.

Targets have included:

* transportation hubs
* churches
* corporate buildings
* businesses
* banks and ATMs

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

Be particularly vigilant during:

* religious holidays
* public celebrations
* major political events, such as elections

Terrorists may use such occasions to mount attacks.

### Demonstrations and strikes

Demonstrations and strikes occur frequently in Santiago, including at Plaza Italia, also known as Plaza Baquedano, as well as in Valparaíso and Concepción. They also occur occasionally elsewhere in the country. They may lead to:

* roadblocks
* public transportation disruptions
* confrontations with police, who sometimes use tear gas and/or water cannons

Public sector strikes also occur and can affect service availability.

Large demonstrations often take place on dates of national significance such as:

* March 29 (Day of the Young Combatant)
* May 1 (International Workers’ Day)
* September 11 (anniversary of the 1973 military coup)
* October 18 (anniversary of the 2019 civil unrest)

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Fraud

Credit and debit card as well as ATM fraud occurs.

When using your debit or credit card:

* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* pay careful attention when others are handling your cards
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* use ATMs located in public areas or inside a bank or business
* check the amount being charged on the card reader
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

Telephone scams are also frequent in Chile.

* Never provide any personal or financial information over the phone
* Never provide information about the whereabouts of your family members
* Never reply to or click on links in text messages coming from unfamiliar numbers

### Spiked food, drinks and other items

Snacks, beverages, gum and cigarettes may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

* Be wary of accepting these items from new acquaintances
* Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers
* Pay attention when drinks are prepared and served, especially in tourist neighbourhoods such as Santiago’s Bellavista and Suecia neighbourhoods

### Adventure travel

Outdoor activities, such as volcano tours, desert expeditions, water activities, hiking, and mountain biking, can be dangerous. Trails are not always marked and weather conditions can change rapidly, regardless of the season.

Safety features in vehicles and on small boats used in river and lake excursions are not always reliable.

If you intend to participate in adventure travel activities:

* share your itinerary with a friend or family member if you’re alone
* use a registered tour/expedition company
* buy travel insurance that covers incidents related to these types of recreational activities and includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* avoid venturing off marked trails
* ensure that you’re adequately equipped and bring sufficient water
* monitor weather conditions and other possible hazards
* know the symptoms of acute altitude sickness, dehydration and heatstroke, which can be fatal

For outdoor activities along the borders with Argentina, Bolivia or Peru, you must register with Chile’s National Department of State Borders and Boundaries (DIFROL).

### Landmines

Marked minefields pose a risk in remote areas bordering the following countries:

* Argentina
* Bolivia
* Peru

If you’re travelling to remote border areas:

* stay on main roads and paved surfaces
* avoid fields, roadside ditches, shoulders and unmarked trails
* cross only at official border crossings
* pay attention to signs indicating the possible presence of landmines

### Land border posts with Argentina

Due to weather conditions impacting road safety, authorities regularly close land border posts with Argentina during the winter, from June to September.

* Stay informed of regional weather forecasts
* Plan accordingly
* Follow the instructions of local authorities

### Roads

#### Road safety

Road safety may vary considerably across the country.

Accidents, particularly in Santiago, are common.

#### Road conditions

Road conditions in urban areas are generally very good. However, driving on some secondary roads or in mountainous areas can be dangerous due to:

* insufficient lighting
* lack of guardrails
* poor maintenance
* difficult winter weather conditions
* strong side winds
* unpaved roads

#### Driving habits

Drivers are often reckless or aggressive, and the road laws are different from those in Canada.

You should drive defensively if you’re driving in Chile.

### Public transportation

There has been an increase in recent years of criminal groups targeting tourists using public transportation. They use the ploy of distracting their victims and then taking their belongings on buses and the metro, and at bus stations and airports.

Tourists travelling on intercity buses, especially from Calama to Antofagasta, San Pedro de Atacama or Santiago, have been robbed while sleeping.

* Always be vigilant and take extra care when using public transportation
* Watch your bags at all times while waiting for transportation
* Always carry your valuables and identification with you and avoid storing them in overhead compartments on buses and trains

#### Taxis

Credit card fraud has happened in unauthorized taxis, particularly at airports. Drivers may pretend to be driving official taxis and charge excessive amounts, sometimes without customers' knowledge. This is done by adding extra digits to the fare or presenting a card reader without a readable display.

When using a taxi from the airport:

* book and prepay for your taxi at an official stand inside the terminal
* beware of people posing as taxi drivers, especially near the terminal exit
* board taxis only in designated areas
* check the amount on the card reader before inserting or tapping your payment card

In cities:

* book a taxi in advance rather than hailing one on the street, especially late in the evening
* never share a taxi with strangers
* avoid using taxis that don’t have a meter
* agree on the fare with the driver before you get in to avoid overcharging
