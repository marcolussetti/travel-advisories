Coastal waters can be dangerous, especially on the Atlantic Ocean side of the island. Riptides are common.

### Adventure tourism

Outdoor activities, such as hiking, mountain biking and other adventure activities can be dangerous if unprepared. Weather conditions can change rapidly.

If you intend to practice adventure tourism:

* never do so alone, and do not part with your expedition companions
* obtain detailed information on your activity and on the environment in which you will be before setting out
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* stay informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* refrain from using facilities or equipment if you have doubts on their safety

### Road safety

Road safety can vary considerably across the island.

Roundabouts are common. There have been incidents of traffic collisions involving visitors occurring at or around roundabouts. Take extra care when approaching or navigating roundabouts.

#### Road Conditions

Major roads can become slippery and muddy after rainfall.

Driving can also be dangerous due to:

* narrow rural roads
* blind curves
* inadequate lighting
* lack of road signs
* unmarked roads
* pedestrians on the roads
* potholes
* abrupt stopping by drivers

### Public transportation

#### Buses

Most buses from the Barbados Transport Board are not reliable and they often travel at high speeds. These can be easily identified as they are painted blue or yellow and license plates beginning with the letter B.

#### Mini-buses

Mini-buses are privately-owned with licence plates beginning with the letter Z, and are often crowded. They tend to travel at high speed and are known to sometimes be involved in traffic accidents.

#### Taxis

Taxis are generally reliable.

Taxis don’t use meters. There are standard taxi fares for most destinations.

* Only use licensed taxis
* Take particular care late at night
* Confirm the fare in advance
* Have small bills available for payment
