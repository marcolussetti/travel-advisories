# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Pool Department

Congolese authorities occasionally carry out security operations against rebel militias in certain regions of Pool, a department in southeast Congo. Criminals often commit crimes and acts of banditry, especially kidnapping for ransom. Attacks on private and collective transportation vehicles are common, particularly on the roads linking Brazzaville–Kinkala–Mindouli and Mayama–Mindouli.

### Border area with the Central African Republic

Criminal gangs and armed militias are rampant in the Central African Republic (CAR). The porous CAR-Congo border poses a risk to the Congolese side.

### Border area with the Democratic Republic of Congo

Exercise extreme caution if you’re travelling in the border area of northern Congo along the Ubangi River, due to ongoing insecurity in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

### Overall security situation

The security situation is stable but remains tense and could deteriorate quickly.

* Exercise extreme vigilance
* Comply with the instructions of local authorities at checkpoints
* Monitor local media

### Crime

Criminal activity occurs, especially at night. Criminals are sometimes armed. Street crimes such as muggings and purse snatchings occur, particularly in Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire.

* Avoid displaying signs of affluence
* Avoid travelling alone after dark
* Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times

There have been a number of break-ins and burglaries at residences in Brazzaville and Pointe‑Noire. Thieves target the homes of foreigners.

Thieves are active along Pointe-Noire’s beaches.

* Confine your activities to busy beaches
* Avoid visiting beaches after dark

Local police resources are limited. Response times to emergency calls are often very slow. In robbery cases, legal recourse is limited.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations occur. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to significant disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety are mostly poor throughout the country. Accidents causing fatalities are common. Drivers are extremely aggressive and often drive at excessive speeds.

Driving can also be dangerous due to:

* insufficient lighting
* the presence of pedestrians, cyclists and animals on the road

Congo has several highways, including National Route 1 between Brazzaville and the southern port city of Pointe-Noire, and National Route 2 between Brazzaville and the northern town of Ouesso, on the border with Cameroon.

Avoid travelling by car between Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire due to attacks on vehicles, incidents of harassment and intimidation, and arrests along the route. Instead, travel by air between Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire.

Most rural roads are dirt tracks. Rural driving conditions may be hazardous during the rainy season.

If you’re travelling overland outside of major cities, do so during the day and in a convoy of at least two four-wheel-drive vehicles. Bandits pose a threat.

Fuel shortages occur frequently. Gas stations are scarce in rural areas. Professional roadside assistance is not available. If you choose to drive, be sure to carry:

* a cellular telephone
* road maps
* spare tires
* a first aid kit
* ample supplies of food, water and gas

#### Roadblocks

Undisciplined, armed soldiers maintain poorly marked checkpoints and roadblocks throughout the country. Security forces may stop foreigners and attempt to extort money or goods. If Congolese authorities stop you at a roadblock, remain in your vehicle and present your documents through the window.

### Public transportation

Be vigilant when travelling by taxi. Hire only government-authorized green and white taxis in Brazzaville and blue and white taxis in Pointe-Noire. Taxis are not metered. Negotiate your fare before departing.

Avoid travelling by bus because of overcrowding, poor vehicle maintenance and potential onboard theft.

Avoid travelling by rail because of frequent mechanical delays, onboard theft and incidents of harassment and intimidation by security forces.

### **Power outages**

Power outages occur frequently.

### Tourism infrastructure

Tourist facilities are limited.

### Women’s safety

Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse.
