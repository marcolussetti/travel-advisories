### Export

Arts and crafts are subject to an export tax. It’s illegal to export items of historical significance, such as wood pieces, sculptures and paintings. Convicted offenders can expect heavy fines or jail sentences.

### Identification

Carry copies of all your travel documents, in case Congolese authorities seek verification of your identity at checkpoints or roadblocks. You may be detained by police if you’re unable to produce acceptable identification.

### Driving

You must carry an International Driving Permit.

Penalties for drinking and driving are severe. The legal blood alcohol limit is 0.08%. If the police suspect you of drinking and driving, they could confiscate your driver’s licence on the spot. If you’re convicted, you can expect heavy fines.

### Dual citizenship

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of the Republic of Congo, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and the Republic of Congo.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in the Republic of Congo by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in the Republic of Congo to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Congolese law doesn’t prohibit sexual acts between individuals of the same sex. Homosexuality, however, is not socially tolerated.

2SLGBTQI+ persons should carefully consider the risks of travelling to the Republic of Congo.

### Money

The currency in the Republic of Congo is the CFA franc (XAF). The economy is primarily cash-based. A few hotels and restaurants in Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire accept credit cards.
