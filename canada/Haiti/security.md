### Border closure with the Dominican Republic

On March 5, 2024, the Government of the Dominican Republic closed its air border with Haiti. Land and sea borders between the two countries remain closed to travellers.

The Embassy of Canada to Haiti, in Port-au-Prince, cannot help you enter the Dominican Republic from Haiti.

### Crime

#### Overview

The security situation remains extremely volatile in Haiti. Gang violence is high in Port-au-Prince and in Artibonite Department. There are frequent clashes between gangs and security forces. Armed gangs control most of Port-au-Prince. Vigilante groups violently attack and kill alleged gang members.

Police have very limited resources to respond and help. If you are currently in Haiti, your personal safety is at risk. If you can do so safely, consider leaving the country by commercial means.

If you are in Haiti:

* shelter in a safe place until the situation has stabilized
* ensure that you have essential supplies, including food, water and fuel
* ensure that your passport and other travel documents are up-to-date and secure at all times
* limit your movements, if you are unable to shelter in place
* avoid crossing road blockades, even if they appear unattended
* maintain a low profile when going outside
* always exercise extreme caution

#### Violent crime

Violent crime is common, including:

* kidnappings
* gender-based violence
* murders
* armed robberies
* car jackings

Home invasions are frequent. These incidents generally occur in middle-class neighbourhoods and in affluent neighbourhoods in Port-au-Prince and outside Pétion-Ville.

Criminality often occurs in certain periods such as:

* the holiday season in December
* carnival in February or March
* the beginning of the school year in late August or early September

Foreigners are viewed as wealthy and may arouse envy. To avoid becoming a target:

* don’t show signs of affluence
* be aware of your surroundings at all times
* keep your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, in a secure place
* remain cautious with new acquaintances offering friendship or hospitality
* never walk alone and avoid travelling after dark

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs frequently.

#### States of emergency

The Haitian government frequently declares regional states of emergency due to the deteriorating security situation. A state of emergency allows the military to assist police forces in responding to security incidents. Authorities may impose a curfew during a state of emergency.

When a state of emergency is in effect, security forces have increased rights to:

* restrict freedom of movement
* conduct searches and seizures
* confiscate unregistered vehicles
* detain persons of interest

While the state of emergency is in effect:

* follow the instructions of local authorities
* always cooperate with police officers
* always carry valid identification and be prepared for various checkpoints
* monitor local media for the latest information

#### Greater Port-au-Prince area

Several areas in greater Port-au-Prince continue to be dangerous due to criminal activity and kidnappings. Local authorities may have difficulties assisting during an emergency in these areas:

* Artibonite Central
* Bas-Delmas
* Bel Air
* Carrefour
* Carrefour Drouillard
* Champs-de-Mars
* Cité Soleil
* Croix-des-Bouquets
* Downtown Port-au-Prince
* Fontamara
* Jalousie
* Laboule 12
* Martissant
* Portail Léogane
* Road to the airport
* Santo
* Tabarre
* Torcelle
* Toussant Brave

Police presence is not guaranteed in these areas and your personal safety might be at risk. Due to the local environment, security forces may not be able to provide emergency assistance in due time.

If you must travel to these areas, it’s imperative that you take appropriate security precautions:

* be vigilant at all times when moving about the city, towns and country
* ensure that your local contacts know when to expect you and your travel plans within these areas
* ask your local contacts to guide you in your travels
* keep windows closed and doors locked when travelling by car
* never use public transport of any kind
* ask the organizations, institutes or hosts that are taking care of you about the latest updates on the region to which you are travelling, since the security situation can change at any moment
* avoid going out after nightfall
* follow the advice of local authorities

#### Pétion-Ville

Armed robberies occur regularly in Pétion-Ville. In most cases, armed thieves on motorcycles attack their victims in broad daylight. Attacks have been increasing, particularly against motorists. They usually occur in traffic jams during peak hours.

* Be vigilant at all times while travelling
* Keep windows closed and doors locked when travelling by car

#### Main highways and roads

Armed gangs have set up roadblocks to commit robberies and demand payments along Route Nationale 2 from Martissant to Miragoane.

Armed gangs are fighting to control the main highways connecting Port-au-Prince to northern departments.

If you must drive:

* limit your movements
* avoid crossing road blockades, even if they appear unattended
* allow extra time to reach your destination

#### Airports

There are two international airports in the country, which can be difficult to access due to the highly volatile security situation.

You are strongly advised against road travel from Port-au-Prince to Cap-Haitian, given the presence of gangs and the highly volatile security situation. You may need to change your travel plans with little notice.

Thieves try to distract foreigners to steal their passports at Toussaint Louverture International Airport.

* Be cautious when claiming your luggage upon arrival
* Keep your valuables and identification on you
* Have your local contacts arrange for your pick-up from the airport
* Carry only small amounts of cash
* Don’t resist if you’re threatened by robbers
* Be extremely vigilant when leaving the airport

### Border with the Dominican Republic

The security environment is highly volatile at the border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic.

Criminal activities are widespread near the border with the Dominican Republic. Armed gangs operate along the border controlling many of the roads leading to the border.

Border areas with the Dominican Republic are subject to gang operations, including the following areas:

* Malpasse
* Ouanaminthe

### Robberies in bank areas

Some criminals wait near banks, watching clients, and attempt to rob them when they leave.

There is also a higher risk of robbery from individuals using bank ATMs.

* Be extremely vigilant when entering or leaving a bank
* Only use ATMs inside a hotel or supermarket
* Deal directly with a teller if you are at a bank
* Avoid carrying large sums of money

### Kidnappings

Kidnappings are common.

Kidnappers target both local people and foreigners, including dual citizens who live or travel in Haiti, regardless of rank or social class. Missionaries, aid workers and children can become victims. Most of the victims are released in exchange for ransom. In some exceptional cases, however, victims have disappeared or have been killed.

* Remain alert to small groups of loiterers, especially near your residence
* Keep doors and windows secure at all times
* Instruct domestic staff to permit into your home only pre-authorized visitors whose identities have been verified
* Keep all visitors under close scrutiny
* Remain extremely vigilant wherever you are in the country

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations and civil unrest take place frequently.

Due to ongoing political instability, some demonstrations have turned violent. Protesters have set up roadblocks across the country and blocked the access to the airport. In those circumstances, water, food and fuel shortages could occur.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Service outages and supply shortages

Power outages are frequent, and shortages of essential supplies such as water and fuel occur.

Ensure that you plan adequately in case of outages and supply shortages.

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety are poor throughout the country due to:

* narrow and poorly maintained roads
* insufficient traffic signs, traffic lights and road markings
* high rates of driving while impaired, with the vehicle’s lights off
* poor vehicle maintenance
* inadequate street lighting

Heavy rains can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable and bridges damaged.

If you need to travel within Haiti, consider hiring a driver through a reputable agency or hotel. If you must drive:

* always keep your fuel tanks at least half full, as disruptions of fuel supplies are frequent
* always carry a cell phone and a list of emergency contact numbers with you, as roadside assistance services are deficient
* keep in mind that cell phone coverage may be intermittent in some rural areas
* avoid driving at night or in bad weather, even in the city
* be cautious about abandoned vehicle beside the road
* watch out for pedestrians and stray animals on the road

### Public transportation

Public transportation is unsafe and unreliable. Drivers don’t always respect traffic laws. Vehicles are often in poor condition or overloaded, which leads to serious accidents involving injuries and sometimes death.

You should avoid all public transportation in Haiti, but most specifically trucks converted into buses, known as “tap taps.”

#### Ferries

Ferry accidents occur and are often caused by poor safety practices or extreme weather conditions.

You should avoid ferry travel. If you choose to travel by ferry:

* make sure the vessel you are boarding is carrying appropriate safety equipment
* make sure that life jackets are provided for all passengers and accessible at all times
* avoid boarding vessels that appear overloaded or unseaworthy
* verify the safety standards of ferries with your tour operator
