## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

Legal fees can be very high and judicial procedures are slow. Some Canadians have experienced an over a year detention period before being sent to trial. Prison conditions are extremely difficult. Penal facilities are overcrowded, unsanitary and under-resourced.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect lengthy legal proceedings, heavy jail sentences and fines.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Haiti.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Haiti, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Haiti.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Haiti by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Haiti to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Haitian law does not prohibit sexual acts between individuals of the same sex.

However, 2SLGBTQI+ persons could be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression or sex characteristics.

### Driving

In order to fight insecurity, local authorities have temporarily forbidden to drive vehicles with tinted windows throughout the country.

You may use your Canadian driver’s licence to drive in Haiti for up to 3 months. For stays of 3 months or more, you will require a Haitian driver’s permit.

You should carry an international driving permit.

### Photography

People may feel exploited or insulted by being subjects of photography in poor or urban areas.

Obtain permission before photographing individuals.

### Donations

Donations entering the country are subject to import rules. They could be seized and taxed in accordance with local legislation. This includes:

* clothing
* new or used material goods
* personal care products
* medications

Contact the Embassy of the Republic of Haiti or one of its consulates before sending goods to Haiti.

### Money

The currency in Haiti is the Haitian gourde (HTG).

Although all prices should be in gourde since March 2018, they are still often quoted in Haitian dollars (5 gourdes = 1 Haitian dollar) or in U.S. dollars.

Canadian currency is not accepted. Most leading hotels accept major credit cards. You can also use your Canadian bank cards to access funds from some ATMs, but the withdrawal limit is much lower than in Canada. Haitian ATMs are unreliable and you should not depend upon them in emergency situations.

Make sure to have sufficient cash in case you’re unable to access an ATM or use your credit card.
