# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

The authorities of a country or territory decide who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Haitian authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for the expected duration of your stay in Haiti.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Visas

Tourist visa: not required for stays up to 90 days  
Business visa: not required  
Student visa: required  
Work permit: required

#### Residency permit

You must obtain a residency permit if you intend to stay for 90 days or more. This requirement doesn’t apply to Canadians of Haitian origin.

If you plan to extend your stay beyond 90 days and are a Canadian of non-Haitian origin, you must apply to the Haitian Immigration Service before the 90 days have expired. If you fail to do so, you will need an exit visa to leave the country.

Canadian investors, exporters/importers and workers must apply to the Haitian Immigration Service for a residency permit through their employer for stays of 6 months or more. You must obtain this document before leaving Canada.
