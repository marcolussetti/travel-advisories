## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect jail sentences or heavy fines.

### Camouflage clothing

It’s illegal for anyone, including children, to dress in army or camouflage clothing or to carry items made of camouflage material.

### Imports/exports

Customs authorities may enforce strict regulations concerning the import or export of certain items, including business equipment, food and beverages, and chemicals.

### Driving

Traffic drives on the left.

To drive in Dominica, you must have a valid Canadian driver’s licence. You must also purchase a temporary Dominican driving permit, which is valid for 30 days. These are available at:

* local airports
* car rental firms
* the Traffic and Licensing Department on High Street in Roseau
* the Portsmouth Police Station

Penalties for drinking and driving are severe. The legal blood alcohol limit is 50 mg per 100 ml of blood, meaning that even one drink could place you above the legal limit. If the police suspect you of drinking and driving, they could confiscate your driver’s licence on the spot. If you’re convicted, you can expect heavy fines.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Dominican law prohibits sexual acts between individuals of the same sex.

2SLGBTQI+ persons could also be discriminated against or detained based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or sex characteristics.

2SLGBTQI+ persons should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Dominica.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Dominica.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Dominica, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Dominica.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Dominica by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Dominica to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.
