# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Crime

Violent crime is low.

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and bag snatching, occurs mostly in larger cities. Vehicle break-ins are common.

Robberies of safe-deposit facilities are common at inexpensive hotels and hostels.

* Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Never leave personal belongings, such as money, credit cards, cell phones and other electronics, unattended
* Exercise caution in popular tourist areas

### Online scam

Scammers have duped tourists into transferring money to an overseas bank account in exchange for renting accommodation in Australia.

When renting accommodation, beware of online scams.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations may occur. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism. The Government of Australia maintains a national terrorism threat advisory system. Individuals or groups have developed both the intent and capability to conduct a terrorist attack in Australia. Terrorist attacks could occur at any time.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

### Spiked food and drinks

Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as they may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

### Adventure tourism

Outdoor activities, such as white water rafting, kayak, scuba diving, snorkelling, bungee jumping, zip lining, paragliding, hiking, mountain biking and other extreme sports, can be dangerous.

You should be prepared for hot and dry weather in the summer. Stay informed about weather conditions before you participate in outdoor activities. Make sure you are properly equipped and aware of other conditions that may pose a hazard to your activity.

Tour operators may not meet Canadian safety standards.

If you intend to participate in adventure tourism activities:

* share your itinerary with friends or family if you're alone, including your return time
* never trek alone
* stay on marked trails or slopes and consider hiring an experienced guide from a reputable company
* ask for detailed information on your activity and the environment you will be in
* buy travel insurance that covers incidents related to adventure activities, including helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to tackle the challenges of your activity
* know the symptoms of acute altitude sickness, dehydration and heatstroke, which can be fatal
* bring proper equipment and enough water
* don't use equipment if you are unsure of its condition or safety
* monitor weather conditions and other possible hazards

### Water activities

Coastal waters can be dangerous. Riptides are common and can be dangerous. Several drownings occur each year.

In certain areas, sharks, crocodiles, jellyfish and other wildlife pose a risk to swimmers.

* Avoid unsupervised beaches
* Follow the instructions and warnings of lifeguards
* Respect the flag warning system, which provides notice of water conditions and safety risks on beaches

You must provide a medical declaration for diving or snorkelling. Follow the instructions and warnings of local authorities.

### Remote areas

Some regions in Australia's interior are very isolated and have small populations. Services are scarce.

You may have difficulty getting adequate mobile phone coverage if you travel there by car.

* Avoid travelling alone
* Inform relatives of your itinerary

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety are very good throughout the country. Exercise caution when driving in rural areas at night. Drivers often drive at excessive speeds. Roaming animals and road trains pose further hazards.

Access to some remote locations may be impossible during severe weather conditions. Due to the great distances between settlements and the isolation of many outback areas:

* avoid travelling in extreme heat conditions
* plan your overland route carefully
* provide a friend or relative with your itinerary, and ensure that your vehicle is in good repair
* carry a first-aid kit and personal medication
* carry sufficient fuel, water, and food supplies
* bring a satellite phone or an emergency position indicating radio beacon (EPIRB)
