### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and France.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Saint Pierre and Miquelon court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Saint Pierre and Miquelon to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Driving

You must be at least 17 years old to drive a car in Saint Pierre and Miquelon.

As a tourist, you can drive with a valid Canadian driver's licence for up to 90 days.

If you are a resident of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, you can drive with a valid Canadian driver's licence for up to a year, after which you will need to exchange it for a French driver’s licence.

If you are travelling to Saint Pierre and Miquelon by car, make sure your vehicle is covered by your insurance policy, as the archipelago is not considered to be in North America.

#### Right of way

The “right of way” system is in effect in Saint Pierre and Miquelon. Drivers must give way to vehicles approaching from the right at intersections, even on secondary roads. This often comes as a surprise to unaccustomed foreign drivers.

Vehicles already in a roundabout have priority over those trying to enter it. In this case, priority is given to the left rather than the right.

Pay attention when driving in Saint Pierre and Miquelon.

### Money

The currency of Saint Pierre and Miquelon is the euro (EUR).

However, Canadian dollars are widely accepted.
