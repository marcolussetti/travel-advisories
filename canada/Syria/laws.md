### Journalism

Syrian authorities scrutinize foreign journalists and media. Reporters can face considerable restrictions in the context of their work.

Journalists attempting to work in Syria without official approval from the Syrian government place themselves at considerable risk. Armed groups in opposition-held areas have injured, kidnapped and killed journalists and other foreigners operating there.

The Syrian Arab Armed Forces and other armed groups have also detained journalists in Syria.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Syrian law criminalizes sexual acts and relationships between persons of the same sex.

2SLGBTQI+ persons could also be discriminated against or detained based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression or sex characteristics. They could be charged with promotion of homosexuality. If they are convicted, they could face the death penalty.

2SLGBTQI+ persons should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Syria.

The Government of Canada’s ability to provide consular services in Syria is extremely limited.

[Dual citizens](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/documents/dual-citizenship?_ga=2.145632180.1604988387.1722891959-1748139045.1691506137)

### Compulsory military service

Men aged 18 or over who are of Syrian descent, including dual citizens and those without Syrian citizenship, must complete compulsory military service or pay an exemption fee if they travel to Syria. If you choose to travel to Syria despite the advisory to avoid all travel to the country, contact the Syrian government before travelling for information on compulsory military service.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Syria.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Syria by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Syria to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Money

The currency of Syrian is the Syrian pound (SYP).

The economy is primarily cash-based. Credit cards are not widely accepted. You should carry enough U.S. dollars or Euros to cover your expenses.

ATMs are available in major cities, such as Damascus and Aleppo, but are not always reliable.

Due to international sanctions, several foreign credit institutions and banks have suspended their transactions with Syria. As a result, you may not be able to use your Canadian credit and debit cards. Contact your financial service provider before travelling to Syria to confirm whether you can use your cards there. Regulations regarding financial transactions, financial sanctions and currency exchange can change without notice.

It’s illegal to exchange currency on the street. You must exchange foreign currency in banks or at official exchange counters. The Syrian pound cannot be exchanged outside the country. You will need to present official exchange receipts to exchange Syrian pounds into foreign currency before your departure. Keep all your official exchange receipts.
