## Safety and security

### Tensions in the Middle East

The security situation remains unpredictable and could deteriorate significantly with little or no warning.

This may result in travel disruptions, including flight cancellations and airspace closures.

You should:

* monitor local and international media to stay informed of the rapidly evolving situation
* be vigilant and follow the instructions of local authorities at all times
* Register or update your contact information with the [Registration of Canadians Abroad](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/registration "https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/registration") service to receive the latest information from the Government of Canada

### Security situation

In December 2024, opposition forces took control of Syria’s capital, Damascus, toppled the former regime and formed a transitional government.

Despite ongoing efforts by the transitional government to dismantle armed factions and strengthen security, violent clashes continue to occur between minority communities, groups loyal to the former regime and security forces from the interim government, resulting in casualties, both civilian and combatant. The situation remains volatile and unpredictable. The risk of kidnapping, including of foreign nationals, has been increasing throughout Syria.

Israeli air strikes continue to occur throughout the country, including in Damascus. The strikes have targeted military installations, transitional government's buildings and security forces positions.

Damascus airport is operational and Aleppo airport has resumed limited commercial operations. However, several airlines have not resumed operations to and from Syria. Land border crossings and airspace may close without notice.  The Government of Canada has urged Canadians to leave Syria since November 2011.

If you choose to travel to Syria or remain in the country despite this advisory:

* register or update your contact information through the Registration of Canadians Abroad service
* ensure that your travel documents are up to date
* identify safe means to leave the country
* exercise extreme caution at all times
* always be aware of your surroundings

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in Syria.

Despite international counter-terrorism operations, terrorist actors remain active in the country and could take advantage of the political instability to carry out attacks.

Attacks, both targeted and indiscriminate, are unpredictable. They could involve the following types of weapons and/or devices:

* suicide vests
* improvised explosive devices (IEDs)
* vehicle-borne IEDs
* rockets and mortars
* assault weapons

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners
* residential areas

Be particularly vigilant during:

* religious holidays
* public celebrations
* major political events

Terrorists may use such occasions to mount attacks.

### Crime

There is a high crime rate. Smuggling and trafficking activities occur in southwestern Syria, especially along the border with Iraq.

There is widespread corruption and bribery throughout the country. Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs.

* Avoid travelling at night
* Do not show signs of affluence or wear expensive jewellery
* Do not carry large sums of cash or valuables unnecessarily
* Keep your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, in a secure place
* Avoid isolated areas

### Kidnapping

Kidnapping for ransom is a frequent phenomenon in various parts of the country, especially in tribal areas and across southern Syria. Others are disappeared. Politically motivated kidnappings by armed and terrorist groups often result in execution or disappearances.

* Be extremely vigilant at all times
* Use varied and unpredictable routes and schedules when travelling

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations occur. Security forces may use excessive force to disperse crowds.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor international and social media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Women's safety

Women travelling alone are at risk of facing harassment and verbal abuse, and in some areas—notably in territories controlled by terrorist groups—are at risk of physical assault.

### Service outages and supply shortages

Due to infrastructure damage and mismanagement, Syria experiences regular power outages. At best, some areas of the country receive roughly 2-3 hours of electricity per day. Those who are most fortunate rely on fuel-powered generators. Access to fuel is rare and inconsistent.

Drought has caused severe water and food shortages across the country. Safe running water may not always be available.

Telecommunications are sometimes disrupted without notice.

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety are poor throughout the country. Unenforced traffic law and problematic roads and infrastructure make road travel very dangerous. Authorities may also impose road travel restrictions without notice, making travel slow and dangerous.

Avoid driving after dark.

#### Roadblocks and checkpoints

Roadblocks and checkpoints are common, including on major roads and highways in and around major cities. They are also present along the highways connecting Damascus to Aleppo, Jordan and Beirut.

Never attempt to cross roadblocks, even if they appear unattended.</>

We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.
