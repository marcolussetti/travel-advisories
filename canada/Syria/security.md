## Safety and security

### Security situation in Syria

The security situation remains volatile. Localized armed clashes and airstrikes are ongoing in several governorates.

Damascus and Aleppo airports have resumed operations, but most airlines are still suspending flights to and from Syria. Confirm the status of your flight with your airline before going to the airport.

The border crossings with Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq are open. However, they may close with little notice. Verify their status before you travel.

The Canadian Government does not have an office in Syria. If you or your family require assistance, contact Global Affairs Canada's 24/7 [Emergency Watch and Response Centre](https://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-assistance).

You should also:

* register or update your contact information through the Registration of Canadians Abroad service
* identify safe means to leave the country
* exercise extreme caution at all times
* always be aware of your surroundings

### Information for Canadians in the Middle East

Heightened tensions in the region could pose security risks in neighbouring countries.

This may result in:

* travel disruptions, including flight cancellations and airspace closures
* military debris falling in various locations

You should:

* monitor local and international media to stay informed of the rapidly evolving situation
* follow the instructions of local authorities at all times
* be vigilant and prepared to shelter in place

If you encounter any debris or fragments:

* move away from them immediately
* contact local authorities

### Security situation

The Syrian conflict began in 2011, and Syria remains an active conflict zone in which the security situation could worsen with little warning.

The Government of Canada has urged Canadians to leave Syria since November 2011. Commercial means to leave the country are limited. Most commercial airlines have suspended their flights. Airports in Damascus and Aleppo are currently closed because of the ongoing fighting. Access to the airports may be impeded due to the volatile security situation.

The Syrian regime and its allies conduct regular strikes in northwest Syria despite a ceasefire agreed to in 2020. Since September 2014, the global coalition against Daesh has carried out aerial bombardment operations on terrorist targets across the northeast. There is also frequent shelling by Türkiye near the northern border due to longstanding tension between Syrian Kurdish groups and neighbouring Türkiye.

Central and southern Syria are unstable and dangerous due to sporadic airstrikes against Iranian-aligned targets. Occasional active fighting between opposition and regime forces, as well as drug-smuggling activities in the area, pose an additional security threat. Syria's chemical and biological weapons program and their historic use on civilians contribute to the volatile situation.

The use of small arms, tanks, artillery and aircraft is common. Common war tactics have also involved:

* blockading entire cities for months or years with little or no warning
* denying entry to humanitarian aid workers and supplies into cities

If you attempt to travel to Syria, you expose yourself to grave risk. In addition to threats from war, terrorism, criminality, arbitrary detention, torture and forced disappearance by the Syrian regime are ongoing threats.

The Embassy of Canada in Damascus has suspended its operations. Our ability to provide consular assistance and other support in Syria is extremely limited.

Do not travel to Syria. If you choose to travel to Syria, or remain in the country, despite this advisory:

* keep in mind that you are responsible for your own safety and that of your family
* ensure that your travel documents are up to date

### Terrorism

There is a significant threat of terrorism in Syria. Extremist groups control parts of the country and pose a dangerous risk to foreigners. Terrorist attacks including suicide bombings, car bombings and other violent incidents occur regularly, resulting in civilian casualties.

Further attacks are likely, and the security situation could worsen with little warning.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners
* residential areas

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places. Be particularly vigilant during:

* religious holidays
* public celebrations
* major political events

Terrorists may use such occasions to mount attacks.

### Crime

The crime rate has increased significantly in Syria. State and non-state actors engage in criminal markets. Smuggling and trafficking routes have greatly expanded throughout southwestern Syria. There is widespread corruption and bribery throughout the country. Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs.

* Avoid travelling at night
* Avoid showing signs of wealth
* Ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times

### Kidnapping

Kidnapping for ransom is a frequent phenomenon in various parts of the country, especially in tribal areas and across southern Syria. Others are disappeared. Politically motivated kidnappings by armed and terrorist groups often result in execution or disappearances.

* Be extremely vigilant at all times
* Use varied and unpredictable routes and schedules when travelling

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations rarely occur. Security forces and the military use excessive force to suppress uprisings and demonstrations throughout Syria.

Peaceful demonstrations frequently turn violent. They lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation. Civilians are frequently arrested without cause and for being near the site of a demonstration.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor international and social media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Women's safety

Women travelling alone are at risk of facing harassment and verbal abuse, and in some areas—notably in territories controlled by terrorist groups—are at risk of physical assault.

### Service outages and supply shortages

Due to infrastructure damage and mismanagement, Syria experiences regular power outages. At best, some areas of the country receive roughly 2-3 hours of electricity per day. Those who are most fortunate rely on fuel-powered generators. Access to fuel is rare and inconsistent.

Drought has caused severe water and food shortages across the country. Safe running water may not always be available.

Telecommunications are sometimes disrupted without notice.

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety are poor throughout the country. Unenforced traffic law and problematic roads and infrastructure make road travel very dangerous. Authorities may also impose road travel restrictions without notice, making travel slow and dangerous.

Avoid driving after dark.

#### Roadblocks and checkpoints

Roadblocks and checkpoints are common, including on major roads and highways in and around major cities. They are also present along the highways connecting Damascus to Aleppo, Jordan and Beirut.

Never attempt to cross roadblocks, even if they appear unattended.</>
