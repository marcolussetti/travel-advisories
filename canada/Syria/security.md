## Safety and security

### Tensions in the Middle East

The security situation remains unpredictable and could deteriorate significantly with little or no warning.

This may result in travel disruptions, including flight cancellations and airspace closures.

You should:

* monitor local and international media to stay informed of the rapidly evolving situation
* be vigilant and follow the instructions of local authorities at all times
* Register or update your contact information with the [Registration of Canadians Abroad](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/registration "https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/registration") service to receive the latest information from the Government of Canada

### Security situation

The security situation remains volatile following the collapse of the former regime in December 2024. Localized clashes between opposing armed groups and airstrikes continue to occur in several governorates across Syria.

Damascus airport is operational and Aleppo airport has resumed limited commercial operations, but several airlines are still suspending flights to and from Syria. Confirm the status of your flight with your airline before going to the airport.

Land border crossings may close with little notice. Verify their status before you travel.

The Canadian Government does not have an office in Syria. If you or your family require assistance, contact Global Affairs Canada's 24/7 [Emergency Watch and Response Centre](https://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-assistance).

You should also:

* register or update your contact information through the Registration of Canadians Abroad service
* identify safe means to leave the country
* exercise extreme caution at all times
* always be aware of your surroundings

On December 8, 2024, opposition forces took control of Syria’s capital, Damascus, toppling the former regime.

The change in power has exacerbated longstanding sectarian tensions. In March 2025, violent armed clashes erupted between groups loyal to the former regime and security forces from the interim government, leading to several casualties, both civilian and combatants. The situation remains volatile.

The interim government is working to dismantle regional armed factions. Efforts remain ongoing to fully implement an agreement to integrate the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), mostly present in northeastern Syria, into Syria’s military institutions by the end of 2025.

Israeli air strikes on military targets continue to occur, especially in western governorates.

The Government of Canada has urged Canadians to leave Syria since November 2011.

If you choose to travel to Syria, or remain in the country, despite this advisory:

* keep in mind that you are responsible for your own safety and that of your family
* ensure that your travel documents are up to date

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in Syria.

Despite international counter-terrorism operations, terrorist actors remain active in the country and could take advantage of the political instability to carry out attacks.

Attacks, both targeted and indiscriminate, are unpredictable. They could involve the following types of weapons and/or devices:

* suicide vests
* improvised explosive devices (IEDs)
* vehicle-borne IEDs
* rockets and mortars
* assault weapons

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners
* residential areas

Be particularly vigilant during:

* religious holidays
* public celebrations
* major political events

Terrorists may use such occasions to mount attacks.

### Crime

There is a high crime rate. Smuggling and trafficking activities occur in southwestern Syria, especially along the border with Iraq.

There is widespread corruption and bribery throughout the country. Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs.

* Avoid travelling at night
* Do not show signs of affluence or wear expensive jewellery
* Do not carry large sums of cash or valuables unnecessarily
* Keep your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, in a secure place
* Avoid isolated areas

### Kidnapping

Kidnapping for ransom is a frequent phenomenon in various parts of the country, especially in tribal areas and across southern Syria. Others are disappeared. Politically motivated kidnappings by armed and terrorist groups often result in execution or disappearances.

* Be extremely vigilant at all times
* Use varied and unpredictable routes and schedules when travelling

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations occur. Security forces may use excessive force to disperse crowds.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor international and social media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Women's safety

Women travelling alone are at risk of facing harassment and verbal abuse, and in some areas—notably in territories controlled by terrorist groups—are at risk of physical assault.

### Service outages and supply shortages

Due to infrastructure damage and mismanagement, Syria experiences regular power outages. At best, some areas of the country receive roughly 2-3 hours of electricity per day. Those who are most fortunate rely on fuel-powered generators. Access to fuel is rare and inconsistent.

Drought has caused severe water and food shortages across the country. Safe running water may not always be available.

Telecommunications are sometimes disrupted without notice.

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety are poor throughout the country. Unenforced traffic law and problematic roads and infrastructure make road travel very dangerous. Authorities may also impose road travel restrictions without notice, making travel slow and dangerous.

Avoid driving after dark.

#### Roadblocks and checkpoints

Roadblocks and checkpoints are common, including on major roads and highways in and around major cities. They are also present along the highways connecting Damascus to Aleppo, Jordan and Beirut.

Never attempt to cross roadblocks, even if they appear unattended.</>

We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.
