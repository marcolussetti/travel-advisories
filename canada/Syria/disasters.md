## Natural disasters and climate

### Earthquakes

Syria is located in an active seismic zone. Earthquakes may occur.

In February 2023, severe earthquakes struck several provinces in southeastern Türkiye. The tremors significantly impacted northern and northeastern Syria, resulting in tens of thousands of casualties and significant damage to critical infrastructure, buildings, and residences.

If you are in an area that was affected by these earthquakes, you can expect continued:

* telecommunication and electricity disruptions
* limited food, water and hygiene options
* limited accommodation choices
* limited transportation alternatives to/from the area

In the event of an earthquake:

* follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders
* monitor local media for the latest developments
* landslides are possible in affected areas, and strong aftershocks may occur after the initial earthquake

### Dust storms

The weather is very dry and hot from May to October. Sand storms and dust storms may occur during the summer months.

Sand-laden winds can blow at high speeds for days, creating difficult driving conditions. These storms can also cause respiratory problems, which can be fatal for some people.

If a dust storm is occurring:

* stay indoors
* keep windows closed
* be prepared to change your travel plans on short notice, including cutting short or cancelling your trip
* monitor local media for up-to-date information on the situation

### Drought and flooding

Syria has been facing drought in recent years, leading to crop failure and severe food shortages.

While infrequent, torrential rains and heavy flooding also occur, which can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable and bridges damaged.

In the event of flooding:

* avoid the affected area
* stay informed of the latest regional weather forecasts
* follow the instructions of local authorities
