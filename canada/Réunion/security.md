# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Demonstrations and civil unrest

Demonstrations and civil unrest occur from time to time.  Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

### Crime

The crime rate is low in Réunion. However, petty crime, such as pickpocketing and bag snatching, could occur.

Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times.

#### Violent crime

Although rare, violent incidents, such as sexual assaults and homicides, do sometimes occur.

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety are very good throughout the island.

Roads are well maintained but may become quickly congested in bad weather conditions. The sole main road, that goes around the island along the coastline, may become impassable in case of heavy rainfall. Some roads are narrow and winding. Night driving can be dangerous, especially in the mountains and on rural roads.

### Public transportation

#### Buses

Bus services are safe. Both urban and inter-city bus transportation is available.

#### Taxis

Taxis are safe but expensive.

Fares must be displayed in taxis. Despite the regulated price, you should agree on a fare prior to departure.

### Swimming

Coastal waters can be dangerous. Riptides are common. Several drownings occur each year.

#### Shark attacks

Shark attacks occur yearly, resulting in fatalities.

To reduce the risk of deadly shark attacks, local authorities supervise water activities, such as swimming and surfing, in some designated areas.  It’s forbidden to practice aquatic activities in dangerous areas.

* Exercise caution when swimming or surfing
* Respect the flag warnings, which provide notice of water conditions and shark risks
* Follow the instructions and warnings of local authorities

#### Stonefish

Stonefish stings are rare but can, in some cases, be fatal. You should get immediate medical attention if stung. Many hotels carry anti-venom serum.

* Ensure that your travel insurance covers accidents related to recreational activities

### Hiking

The Piton de la Fournaise volcano is active, unpredictable and experiences random eruptions. Local authorities have strict regulations in place regarding access to the volcano.

If you intend on hiking:

* never do so alone and always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* ensure that you’re properly equipped and well informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary, including when you expect to be back to camp
* obtain detailed information on trekking routes before setting out and do not venture off marked trails

### Women’s safety

Women travelling alone may be subject to certain forms of harassment and verbal abuse.

### Piracy

Pirate attacks and armed robbery against ships occur in coastal waters and, in some cases, farther out at sea. Attacks in the Indian ocean cannot be ruled out.

Mariners should take appropriate precautions.
