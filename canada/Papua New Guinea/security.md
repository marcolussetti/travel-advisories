### Escalating tensions in the Highlands Region

Since August 2024, inter-tribal armed violent clashes have intensified in the Porgera Valley of Enga Province. The conflict has led to casualties and the destruction of property. The clashes spread to the neighbouring provinces of Hela, Southern Highlands and Western Highlands, including the city of Mount Hagen, where tensions remain high.

Local authorities declared a state of emergency in the area. They have also issued:

* a ban on alcohol sales
* expanded powers for local law enforcement, including the use of lethal force against armed individuals
* a nightly curfew from 6 pm to 6 am
* roadblocks and ID checkpoints

* Avoid areas where protests or clashes are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities, including any evacuation, curfew or movement restriction orders
* Monitor local media for the latest information on the situation

### Inter-ethnic violence

Inter-ethnic tensions often lead to communal violence, sometimes deadly. They occur particularly in:

* the province of Enga
* the province of Hela
* the province of Southern Highlands
* the city of Lae
* the city of Port Moresby

### Crime

#### Violent crime

Violent crime, such as sexual assault, carjacking, home invasion, kidnapping, and armed robbery, is common and often includes the use of lethal weapons such as firearms or machetes. The Highlands provinces and the cities of Lae and Port Moresby are particularly affected.

In Port Moresby, the area around Parliament and the suburb of Waigani experience increased levels of crime.

* Do not travel alone, especially after dark
* Consider hiring private security as police capacity to respond to crimes and other incidents is very limited

Criminals tend to target areas and establishments often frequented by foreigners, including:

* hotels
* clubs
* restaurants and bars
* schools
* places of worship
* outdoor recreation events
* tourist areas, including markets, parks and beaches

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, frequently occurs, particularly in public markets.

* Ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Avoid displaying signs of affluence

### Carjacking

Carjacking occurs in Port Moresby and along the highway between Lae and the Lae Nadzab Airport. They are particularly frequent in the Two-Mile and Nine-Mile settlement areas. Violent attacks on vehicles travelling on the Highlands Highway also occur, particularly between Goroka and Kainantu.

Criminals may attempt to open doors of cars that are stopped or moving slowly in traffic. Assailants may assault their victims while robbing them. Criminals may demand tolls at illegal roadblocks and can assault you if payment is not made.

* Be vigilant while travelling by road
* Drive with windows up and doors locked at all times
* Avoid travel after dark
* Avoid leaving personal belongings unattended in your vehicle

### Piracy

Pirate attacks and armed robbery against ships occur in coastal waters, particularly in the Milne Bay and its capital, Alotau. Mariners should take appropriate precautions.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations take place from time to time, particularly in the cities of Port Moresby, Lae and Mount Hagen. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Unexploded Ordnance

Unexploded ordnance and landmines are present in many islands, including Bougainville and East New Britain.

Avoid walking or hiking off marked roads and trails.

### Bougainville Island

There are no tourist facilities in the area. Transportation options are limited.

There is a risk of violence in the central mountainous area around the Panguna mine and access is restricted. You need a special permission to enter this area.

### Adventure sports

#### Trekking

Attacks on trekkers have occurred, including on the Black Cat track, in Morobe, and on the Kokoda track. Facilities along the Kokoda track are limited.

If you intend on trekking:

* never do so alone
* always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* do not venture off marked trails
* ensure that you're properly equipped
* ensure that you're well informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary, including when you expect to be back
* obtain detailed information on each activity before setting out

#### Diving

Rescue services may not be consistent with international standards.

### Venomous snakes

Venomous snakes are common throughout Papua New Guinea.

If bitten, seek immediate medical attention. The cost of anti-venom is very high. Medical staff can charge up to CAD $6,000 for treatment.

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety are poor throughout the country.

Driving can be hazardous, especially outside major towns. Poorly maintained cars, drunk drivers and roads in disrepair increase the safety risks.

Roads may become impassable due to flash floods and landslides during the rainy season.

If you are involved in a traffic accident, proceed directly to the nearest police station. Crowds tend to form quickly after an incident, and could become hostile and aggressive.

### Public transportation

Public buses, known as public motor vehicles (PMVs), and taxis are poorly maintained. They also are a common target for criminals.

* Avoid travelling by taxi or on public buses
* Whenever possible, arrange for hotel or other private transportation
* Plan to have someone waiting for you at the airport, particularly if arriving in the evening
