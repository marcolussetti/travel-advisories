### Seismic activities

Papua New Guinea is located in an active seismic and volcanic zone. Earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions occur.

#### Volcanoes

There are several active volcanoes throughout Papua New Guinea, and eruptions occur regularly.

Heavy smoke and ash from volcanoes periodically lead to flight disruptions, particularly in the Rabaul region.

In the event of an eruption:

* pay careful attention to all warnings issued
* avoid restricted areas
* follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders
* check with your carrier or tour operator to determine if the situation could affect your travel plans

#### Tsunamis

A tsunami can occur within minutes of a nearby earthquake. However, the risk of tsunami can remain for several hours following the first tremor. If you’re staying on the coast, familiarize yourself with the region’s evacuation plans in the event of a tsunami warning.

### Monsoon

The rainy (or monsoon) season extends from:

* December to March in the northwest
* May to October in the southeast

Seasonal flooding and landslides can hamper overland travel, damage infrastructure and reduce the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable and bridges damaged. This is of particular concern on the Highlands Highway between Lae and Mount Hagen.

* Keep informed of regional weather forecasts
* Avoid affected areas
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
