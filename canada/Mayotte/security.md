# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Crimes of opportunity and petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occur frequently. Thieves could target foreigners, particularly in Kawéni neighbourhood, in the capital Mamoudzou, and in crowded public areas such as:

* markets
* the airport and public transportation facilities
* hotel lobbies
* restaurants, patios and outdoor cafés
* tourist sites and attractions

While you’re in Mayotte:

* ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* don’t keep your passport and other types of ID in the same place and carry a photocopy rather than the original
* avoid showing signs of affluence or wearing expensive jewellery
* avoid carrying large sums of cash or unnecessary valuables
* avoid deserted streets at night
* pay attention to your surroundings, particularly in crowded and tourist areas
* find out which beaches are the safest
* be extra cautious when withdrawing cash from ATMs

#### Residential break-ins

Residential break-ins occur. Burglars sometimes target houses or apartments owned or rented by foreigners.

* Choose well-secured accommodation
* Make sure you lock doors and windows at night and when you’re away

#### Vehicles

Car theft, break-ins and carjacking occur. Rental and luxury vehicles may be a target of choice.

* Familiarize yourself with your route before starting the trip
* Keep your windows and doors locked at all times
* Keep your belongings out of reach
* Use secure parking facilities, especially overnight
* Never leave belongings unattended in a vehicle, even in the trunk

#### Violent crime

Gang-related violence occurs. Criminals often use knives or firearms.

While violent incidents don’t typically target foreigners or tourists, there is a risk of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

Always be vigilant and aware of your surroundings.

### Demonstrations and civil unrest

Spontaneous demonstrations and civil unrest take place from time to time in the main cities due to socioeconomic tensions. Clashes between protesters and security forces have occurred.

Even peaceful demonstrations can suddenly turn violent and lead to clashes with security forces. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic, public transportation and health and emergency services.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Outages and shortages

#### Power outages

Due to extreme weather conditions and the fact that Mayotte has only one electricity provider, power outages occur from time to time.

#### Water shortages

Due to below-average rainfall in the recent years, Mayotte is experiencing regular water shortages.

Plan for adequate supply of water.

### Road safety

Most roads are paved.

In some areas, the presence of pot holes and the lack of maintenance, lighting and traffic lights can make driving conditions hazardous.

### Public transportation

There is no public transportation in Mayotte. You may have to rent a car.

#### Taxis

Taxis are the only urban transport alternative to driving yourself. While they are an affordable option, they are not always safe.

* Avoid hailing taxis on the street
* Use only reputable taxi companies through establishments such as hotels
* Book your ride in advance when possible

If you have no choice but to hail a taxi on the street:

* never enter a cab if it already has one or more passengers
* note the license plate number and name of the driver when you travel
* immediately communicate this information to family or friends

#### Ferry

It’s possible to travel by ferry between the two main islands, Grande-Terre and Petite-Terre.

Ferry accidents occur sometimes due to the overloading and poor maintenance of some vessels.

Don’t board vessels that appear overloaded or unseaworthy.

### Water activities

Coastal waters can be dangerous. Rescue services may not be consistent with international standards.

If you are planning to take part in water sports such as scuba diving, jetskiing or parasailing:

* ensure that equipment is safe and in good condition
* ensure helmets and life jackets are available
* avoid participating in any water activities when you are under the influence of alcohol or other substances
* check that your travel insurance covers accidents related to recreational activities
* follow the instructions and warnings of local authorities

### Hiking

If you intend on hiking:

* never do so alone and always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* ensure that you’re properly equipped and well informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary, including when you expect to be back to camp
* obtain detailed information on trekking routes before setting out and do not venture off marked trails

### Women’s safety

### Piracy

Pirate attacks and armed robbery against ships occur in coastal waters and, in some cases, farther out at sea. Attacks in the Indian ocean cannot be ruled out.

Mariners should take appropriate precautions.
