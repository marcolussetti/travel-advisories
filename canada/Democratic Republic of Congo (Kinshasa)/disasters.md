## Natural disasters and climate

### Rainy season

The rainy season extends from April to October in the north and from November to March in the south. Flash flooding and landslides may occur during these periods and could severely disrupt essential services.

If you are in the affected areas:

* exercise caution
* monitor local news and weather reports
* follow the instructions of local authorities

### Seismic activity

The DRC is located in an active seismic area. Earthquakes may occur.

### Volcanoes

Volcanic eruptions are common in some parts of the country. Mount Nyiragongo, situated on the edge of Goma, is one of the world’s most active volcanoes. The latest eruption in May 2021 forced the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people, caused significant damage to infrastructure and resulted in many casualties.

If you are travelling near an active volcano:

* exercise caution
* take official warnings seriously and respect exclusion zones
* monitor local media to stay up-to-date on latest developments and volcanic activity levels
* follow the advice of local authorities

### Forest fires and bush fires

Forest and bush fires are frequent from June to August. Fire risk ratings and high alert levels may be issued in affected areas. Air quality in an area affected by a forest fire may deteriorate due to thick smoke.

In the event of a major fire:

* stay away from affected areas, especially if you suffer from respiratory problems
* prepare to modify your itinerary or even evacuate the area quickly
* follow the instructions of local emergency services personnel
* check local media regularly for updates
