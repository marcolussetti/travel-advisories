Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Identification

Local authorities may ask you to present your passport and visa at any time. In such situations, you should remain calm and cooperative. Failure to comply could result in expulsion.

* Always carry a certified copy of your passport and visa with you
* Always keep your original passport in a secure place

### Photographs

It is forbidden to take photographs, under penalty of arrest or detention, of the following places:

* government buildings
* airports
* military installations

### Dress and behavior

The DRC is a conservative society. Public displays of affection, including holding hands or kissing, are not socially acceptable.

To avoid offending local residents:

* dress conservatively
* behave with discretion
* respect social and religious traditions
* ask permission before taking their photos

### Lèse-majesté

The law forbids disrespecting the head of state, as well as making remarks alleged to threaten national security and malicious comments in public.

Local authorities have sometimes intimidated, harassed, and arrested journalists, activists, and politicians when they have publicly criticized the government, president or state security forces.

Penalties can be severe, including imprisonment.

### Driving

You should carry an International Driving Permit.

### Other traffic laws

Motorists and pedestrians are required to stop for the raising and the lowering of the national flag at approximately 7:30 a.m. and 6 p.m. every day. Failure to do so may result in a fine.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in the DRC.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of the DRC, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and the DRC.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in the DRC by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in the DRC to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Money

The currency is the Congolese franc (CDF).

The DRC is a cash-based economy. The US dollar is widely accepted. Shopkeepers and foreign exchange dealers require banknotes to be in good condition (without tears and of recent issue, i.e. US dollars printed after 2009).

Credit cards are generally not accepted, except in certain hotels, restaurants and department stores.

Large hotels have ATMs where cash advances can be made using certain credit cards, but these are not always in operation.

#### Currency declaration

You must declare:

* any sum equivalent to more than US$10,000 upon arrival in the country
* any foreign currency upon exit from the country
