# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Security situation in the DRC

The security situation is unstable and unpredictable across the country.

Fighting between government forces and rebel groups has intensified in the east of the DRC. Rebel groups have taken control of the towns of Goma and Bukavu, including the Kavumu airport.

Other cities are also at risk, especially in the east of the country.

Violent demonstrations and civil unrest have taken place in Kinshasa and others may occur without notice. They could target foreign nationals.

There could be temporary roadblocks and road closures without warning, including on roads leading to airports.

**In the east of the DRC**:

* there are currently no flights to or from Goma and Kavumu (Bukavu) international airports
* border posts may close without notice

**In Kinshasa**:

* some airlines have suspended flights to and from Kinshasa
* land and water border crossings may close without notice

If you are in an affected area:

* shelter in place and have adequate supplies, like food and water, until you can identify safe means to leave the area
* register or update your contact information through the Registration of Canadians Abroad service
* exercise extreme caution at all times
* be prepared to leave on short notice

If you or your family require assistance, contact the Embassy of Canada in Kinshasa or Global Affairs Canada's 24/7 [Emergency Watch and Response Centre](https://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-assistance).

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations occur frequently, especially in Kinshasa. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent suddenly. They can also cause major disruption to traffic and public transport.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Eastern DRC

The situation remains volatile in the east of the country due to the persistent presence of and regular clashes between over 120 armed groups.

The affected provinces are:

* Maniema
* North Kivu
* South Kivu
* Tanganyika
* Bas-Uélé
* Haut-Uélé
* Ituri

Crime is endemic throughout these areas, and there are many reports of human rights violations.

### State of siege

Since 2021, the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri have been under a state of military siege. These provinces are under military administration until further notice.

### Provinces of North Kivu and South Kivu

Clashes between the Congolese army and the M23 rebel group continue around Goma in North Kivu.

Despite the signing of peace agreements and the presence of UN forces, armed conflict persists in certain regions outside the provincial capitals. Members of various armed groups continue to perpetrate acts of pillage and violent crimes against the civilian population, including murder, kidnapping, armed assault and rape. The ensuing humanitarian crisis has led to major displacements.

Military operations are still underway in some areas, including near:

* Virunga National Park
* Rutshuru
* Rumangabo
* the tri-border area with Uganda and Rwanda

Military operations could lead to a deterioration in the security situation in various locations outside the two capitals, Goma and Bukavu. Some places are particularly dangerous, including:

#### North Kivu

* Beni
* Masisi
* Rutshuru
* Walikale

#### South Kivu

* Kabare
* Shabunda

Avoid all travel to the provinces of North and South Kivu. If you decide to travel despite this advisory:

* continually reassess the situation to determine whether your presence in the area is warranted
* take into account the information provided by Congolese authorities and MONUSCO, to help avoid dangerous situations
* avoid public transportation
* expect disruptions to local businesses and services, including airports

### Tanganyika Province

The province of Tanganyika, and especially Manono Territory, is the theatre of an ethnic conflict between the Pygmies and the Luba. The Mai-Mai militia periodically re-engage.

### Ituri Province

Armed clashes persist in the province of Ituri. There is a terrorist threat in the Beni and Irumu territories.

### Haut-Lomami Province

Violent crime continues in Haut Lomami Province. Travellers have been ambushed, robbed and kidnapped.

### Border regions of South Sudan, Central African Republic, and Uganda, including Garamba National Park

Despite intensified operations by the Ugandan, Congolese and South Sudanese armed forces and the United Nations, the Lord's Resistance Army continues to commit acts of violence against the civilian population.  Numerous casualties have been reported, and thousands of people have fled the region.

### Points of entry from Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda

Entry points at the Burundi, Uganda and Rwanda borders should be avoided at all times due to the prevailing insecurity and disorder. The borders separating the DRC from Burundi and Rwanda may be closed at any time.

### Kasaï provinces

Although the situation is currently calm in the Kasaï provinces, armed clashes have previously claimed thousands of victims in the provinces of Kasaï, Kasaï-Central and Kasaï-Oriental.  Kidnappings have also taken place.

### Intercommunal violence in Mai-Ndombe

Inter-community violence has been a regular occurrence in Mai-Ndombé Province since June 2022, particularly in the Kwamouth territory where thousands of residents have been displaced. The violence has claimed hundreds of victims. Attacks have also occurred in neighboring provinces, including the commune of Maluku in northern Kinshasa Province.

### Kinshasa

In the capital, choose a hotel in the commune of Gombe, which is both the administrative headquarters and a commercial zone.

* Exercise extreme caution outside the commune of Gombe
* Avoid all travel after dark

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in the Democratic Republic of Congo, particularly:

* in the region of Beni-Butembo and Goma in North Kivu
* in the vicinity of Boga in Ituri
* towards the border with Uganda

Terrorist groups clash over control of good-trafficking routes, mining sites, and agricultural areas.

Attacks on civilians and government targets occur frequently. Further attacks are likely.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as restaurants, bars, coffee shops, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Large-scale events could be targeted.

* Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places
* Monitor local media
* Follow the instructions of the local authorities

### Crime

Crime rates are high in the DRC due to extreme poverty and the lack of enforcement.

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs regularly throughout the country, including in Kinshasa. Theft is frequent:

* on public transportation
* in cars
* in crowded areas
* at and around ATMs

During your trip to the DRC:

* ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and your other travel documents are secure at all times

Kidnappings occur regularly in the eastern and northeastern provinces.  Foreigners are often targeted. Incidents occur mainly in the following areas:

* Virunga Park in North Kivu
* North Kivu, South Kivu, Ituri, Maniema, Tanganika, Bas-Uélé and Haut-Uélé provinces

#### Express kidnappings

Express kidnappings targeting foreigners occur. Victims are usually abducted for a few hours in broad daylight and stripped of their possessions.

These attacks are often perpetrated by small groups of individuals dressed in police uniforms. The threat is particularly high in the Gombe district in Kinshasa.

If you plan to travel to the DRC despite the risks:

* be vigilant at all times
* avoid walking in areas accessible to the public
* use varied and unpredictable routes and schedules
* travel only in a convoy of at least two vehicles for long trips
* if you are threatened, don’t resist

### Curfews

Curfews can be imposed without notice.

Always comply with the directives issued by local authorities.

### Road safety

Road safety is poor throughout the country. Fatal accidents are frequent.

#### Road conditions

Roads are generally poorly maintained and badly lit throughout the country.

Some roads can become impassable during the rainy season and require a four-wheel drive vehicle, including in some parts of the capital, Kinshasa.

The road between Kinshasa and Matadi is paved, but the risk of accidents is very high due to:

* vehicles that are poorly maintained, overloaded and often abandoned on the road
* insufficient lighting
* lack of road signs

#### Driving habits

Drivers don't always respect traffic laws, and police rarely enforce it. Drivers can be aggressive and reckless.

If you drive in the DRC:

* always drive defensively
* plan your trip in advance, especially if you are visiting a rural area
* only travel in convoys of at least two vehicles on long journeys
* avoid traveling after dark
* check with local authorities to see if you need authorization to travel within the country

#### Official motorcades

Motorists should pull over to the shoulder of the road when sirens or police announce the approach of presidential or other official motorcades.

* Avoid taking photos of processions
* Only proceed when the police signal for you to do so

#### Roadblocks

Local authorities may increase the number of roadblocks during the night, especially at the following locations:

* in Gombe
* in Limete, Ngaba, Kintambo, Ngaliema, Ndjili and Mont Ngafula
* around Camp Kokolo

Carry official identification at all times.

Don't cross any roadblock without stopping, even if it seems unguarded.

Representatives of local authorities may try to confiscate your identification in hopes of receiving a bribe to return them. To reduce this risk in the event of an identification check, try as much as possible to show your identification without lowering your car window.

### Law enforcement impersonation

Criminals may impersonate law enforcement officers to extort money from you.

* If you are stopped by an officer, ask to see proof identity
* Don't get into a car with strangers, even if they claim to be police officers

### Women’s safety

Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment or verbal abuse.

### Tourist infrastructure

Tourist facilities are very limited in Kinshasa and virtually non-existent outside the capital.

* Plan your trip accordingly
* Keep a supply of water, food and fuel on hand
* Bring a cell phone, charger and local emergency numbers

### Power outages

Power outages can occur on a nationwide scale.

Local authorities may impose electricity rationing measures.

Power outages sometimes disrupt essential services, such as:

* public transport, including flights
* medical services
* public water supply
* telecommunications
* banking
* purchase of essential goods

Not all buildings have generators.

* Plan accordingly
* Keep a supply of water, food and fuel on hand

### Telecommunications

The telecommunications network is not always reliable. Fixed telephone lines are virtually non-existent, and cell phone coverage can be intermittent.

Internet access may be limited during periods of civil unrest.

* Don't rely on your cell phone in an emergency, especially outside major cities
* Avoid traveling alone
* Inform someone close to you of your itinerary

### Public transportation

Public transport in the DRC is neither reliable nor safe.

You can rent a car with or without a driver from rental companies or travel agencies.

If you're going to Kinshasa, make sure someone meets you at the airport.

Avoid using public transport, including cabs, especially after dark.

#### Buses

Bus routes are not well displayed, and bus stops are poorly located. Vehicles are often overloaded and in very poor condition. Accidents are frequent.

Only use tour operators offering direct routes from your point of departure.

#### Taxis and ride-sharing apps

Not all taxis are officially marked, and they generally do not meet safety or mechanical reliability standards. Some ride-sharing apps are available in Kinshasa.

If you need to take a taxi:

* use an officially marked, reliable cab company recommended by your hotel
* never share a cab with strangers
* use a recommended car apps in Kinshasa

#### Train

Rail service is limited and unsafe. Accidents occur regularly. Poor track conditions and mechanical breakdowns often cause delays. Trains are crowded and often frequented by thieves.
