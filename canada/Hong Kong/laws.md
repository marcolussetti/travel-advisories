## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Safeguarding National Security Ordinance 2024 and National Security Law 2020

The 2024 Safeguarding National Security Ordinance and the 2020 National Security Law have broadened the range of national security offenses, which now include:

* secession
* subversion
* sedition
* espionage
* organisation and perpetration of terrorist activities
* unlawful disclosure of state secrets
* collusion with a foreign country or with external elements that endanger national security
* support to someone accused of endangering national security

They could also include activities that are not considered illegal in Canada and that occurred outside of Hong Kong, and could include social media posts. The Hong Kong SAR Government has issued arrest warrants for individuals outside of Hong Kong they identified as criminals who committed acts endangering national security. If you are suspected of endangering national security, you could be detained without charge for up to 16 days and denied access to a legal representative for up to 48 hours.

You risk being arbitrarily detained on national security grounds, even while you are transiting through Hong Kong. You could be subject to transfer to mainland China for prosecution. Penalties are severe and include life imprisonment.

### Bans and sanctions

The Chinese government may ban or sanction entities or individuals for actions, including oral or written statements, and associations with entities that are critical of:

* the Communist Party of China
* the Chinese government
* Chinese leaders and policies

The Government of the People's Republic of China does not publicize a list of banned or sanctioned entities or individuals, and the implementation of bans or sanctions remains vague. The effect on individuals associated with banned or sanctioned entities is unknown.

It could include:

* a ban on travel to mainland China, Hong Kong and Macao
* freezing of assets
* prohibition of business or association with Chinese citizens and organizations

Hong Kong authorities can enforce Chinese court orders. If you believe you may be subject of a ban or sanctions, consult a lawyer and contact the closest office of the Government of Canada.

### Movement restrictions

Under the national security and immigration laws, Hong Kong authorities may prevent specific individuals from leaving the territory. In the absence of clarifying legislation, these new powers may relate to investigations into an individual, their family or an employer, and criminal and civil matters.

You may not be aware that you are the subject of movement restrictions until you try to leave Hong Kong. It may be difficult to obtain information on movement restrictions from local authorities.

If you're unable to leave Hong Kong because of restrictions on your movement, consult a lawyer and inform the Consulate General of Canada in Hong Kong.

### Facial recognition and use of video surveillance (CCTV)

Law enforcement agencies may rely on facial recognition technology and video surveillance to police, monitor and control illegal or restricted activities, including participation in demonstrations.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect jail sentences and heavy fines.

### Prohibited or controlled items

Hong Kong has strict laws regarding the use, importation or exportation of different items, including:

* firearms and live ammunition
* items that may be used as weapons, such as knuckledusters, extendable batons or stunning devices
* e-cigarettes
* powdered baby formula
* plant or animal products that could carry disease or pests

Your luggage will be scanned upon entry. You could face legal issues if you carry or try to travel with prohibited items.

Confirm the restrictions with the local authorities before travelling.

### Photography

Photography of military installations or government buildings may be restricted. Seek permission from local authorities before taking photographs.

### Dual citizenship

The Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China applies in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). Under this law, dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Hong Kong.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of China, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

If you are a Canadian dual citizen born in Hong Kong or with current or previous Hong Kong residency, you need to complete a declaration of nationality in order to be treated as a Canadian citizen. Consult the Hong Kong Immigration Department regarding this process.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Hong Kong.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Hong Kong, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Hong Kong court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Hong Kong to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Driving

Traffic drives on the left.

As a tourist, you can use your valid Canadian driver's licence for up to 12 months. You should carry an international driving permit.

If you are a resident of Hong Kong, you can exchange your Canadian licence for a local one under certain conditions.

### Money

The currency is the Hong Kong dollar (HKD).

Upon entering or leaving Hong Kong, you must make a declaration to customs if you travel with more than HKD 120,000 or the equivalent in other currencies. The sum can be in cash, cheques, money orders, traveller’s cheques or any other convertible assets.
