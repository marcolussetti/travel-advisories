# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime such as pickpocketing and purse snatching occurs, particularly:

* at the airport
* on public transportation
* in main shopping areas and markets
* in hotel lobbies
* on crowded streets
* at tourist attractions

#### Violent crime

Serious crime against foreigners is relatively rare, but incidents may occur.

While in Hong Kong:

* be vigilant in crowded locations
* don’t carry large sums of money
* ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times

### Spiked food and drinks

Foreigners have been targeted in incidents of drink spiking, particularly in the Wan Chai area. Items containing drugs could put you at risk of sexual assault, robbery or credit card fraud.

* Be cautious of unsolicited requests from strangers
* Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers
* Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances

### Fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud occurs. When using debit or credit cards:

* pay careful attention when others are handling your cards
* use ATMs located inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations are illegal without prior approval from the local government. However, unauthorized and spontaneous demonstrations could still occur.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

If you participate in or are witness to a demonstration, you may be subject to scrutiny and severe legal action.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Don’t film or take pictures of demonstrations
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Cyber security

You shouldn’t expect internet privacy. Your communications may be monitored at any time, and authorities may review the content stored or consulted on your electronic devices.

Authorities will be on the lookout for material appearing to be seditious or that is critical of mainland China and local authorities

### Journalism and research

Journalists and other media workers in Hong Kong are now facing certain restrictions in the context of their work.

You should be particularly vigilant if researching or reporting on subjects critical of or sensitive to the government. You may face censorship.

### Road safety

Traffic is congested in urban areas. Roads are narrow and frequently unmarked.

### Public transportation

Public transportation in Hong Kong is safe and reliable.

#### Taxis

Taxis are widely available. Ride-sharing services are also available.

Most taxi drivers don’t speak English or French. If you don’t speak Chinese, you should arrange for a person to write out your destination in Chinese characters before you go.

* Use only officially marked taxis or a trusted ride-sharing app
* Negotiate fares in advance, or insist that the driver use the meter, as you may be overcharged

We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.
