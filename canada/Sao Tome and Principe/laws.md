### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Sao Tome and Principe.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Sao Tome and Principe by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Sao Tome and Principe to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.
