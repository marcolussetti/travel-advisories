## Safety and security

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and bag snatching, occurs, particularly in crowded public areas such as:

* markets
* beaches
* busy streets
* near hotels

During your trip:

* keep your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, in a secure place
* do not show signs of affluence or wear expensive jewellery
* do not carry large sums of cash or valuables unnecessarily
* avoid deserted beaches and poorly lit areas after dark

#### Violent crime

Although rare, violent crime occurs, including:

* armed robberies
* burglaries and home invasions

During your stay:

* if you're threatened by armed criminals, stay calm and do not resist
* keep doors and windows locked at all times

### Harassment

Homosexuality is not widely accepted in São Toméan society. 2SLGBTQI+ persons could be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression or sex characteristics. Avoid public displays of affection.

### Power outages

Power outages occur frequently.

Power outages could impact essential services, such as:

* public transportation, including flights
* medical services
* the public water supply
* telecommunications
* banking transactions
* the supply of basic necessities

### Demonstrations and civil unrest

Although the country is generally stable, unrest can arise occasionally.

Demonstrations occur. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Travelling in remote areas

Tourism infrastructure is available, but the quality varies greatly across the country.

Some regions are very isolated and have small populations. Services are scarce.

If you are planning to travel to remote areas:

* keep a supply of water, food, fuel and an emergency kit on hand
* bring a cell phone, charger and local emergency numbers

### Telecommunications

The telecommunications network is not always reliable. Inform someone close to you of your itinerary.

### Water activities

#### Swimming

Beaches are generally unsupervised. Ocean currents may be strong.

* Consult residents and tour operators for information on possible hazards, the presence of dangerous species and safe swimming areas
* Follow the instructions of local authorities

#### Diving

Tour operators may not meet Canadian safety standards. There are no hyperbaric (decompression) chambers on the islands.

If you go diving:

* use a reputable company
* do not use the equipment if you are unsure of its safety
* make sure that your travel insurance covers incidents related to this type of recreational activity

### Roads

#### Road safety

Fatal accidents are frequent.

Sidewalks are rare. Avoid walking along roadways.

#### Road conditions

Streets in São Tomé are paved but there are many large potholes.

Roads outside the capital are paved and in fair condition, but they are dangerous due to:

* large potholes
* insufficient lighting
* lack of road shoulders
* stray livestock
* pedestrians and cyclists on the road

Roads may be impassable during the rainy season.

#### Driving habits

Some motorcycle drivers do not have driver's licenses and may not follow the rules of the road.

Honking to warn of your approach is considered a normal practice.

There is no emergency roadside assistance.

If you choose to drive:

* always drive defensively
* exercise caution around motorcycles
* avoid travelling after dark in rural areas
* fill your gas tank before you travel, especially if you are travelling to a remote area

### Public transportation

There are no subways or public buses on the islands. Taxis and motorcycle taxis, known as ‘motoqueiros,’ are common and often shared by multiple passengers.

* Avoid motorcycle taxis
* Choose officially marked taxis when possible
* Ask the driver not to pick up other passengers on the way to your destination
* Confirm the fare in advance
* Have small bills available for payment

### Piracy

Pirate attacks and armed robbery against ships occur in coastal waters and, in some cases, farther out at sea. Mariners should take appropriate precautions.
