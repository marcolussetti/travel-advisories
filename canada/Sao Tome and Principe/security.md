# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Crime

Armed robbery and pickpocketing occur, particularly in public areas such as markets, streets or near hotels. Burglaries and home invasions also occur, but are rare. Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times. Avoid deserted beaches and poorly lit areas after dark.

### Demonstrations and civil unrest

Although the country is generally stable, unrest can arise occasionally.

Demonstrations occur. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Tourist facilities

Tourist facilities are limited but adequate.

### Power outages

Power outages occur frequently.

### Telecommunications

Telecommunications services such as landlines and Internet access are limited, making it difficult to communicate with anyone outside the country.

### Road safety

Streets in Sao Tome are paved but there are many large potholes. Roads outside the capital are paved and in fair condition, but they are poorly lit and can be impassable during the rainy season. Roaming animals pose a hazard to drivers. Drivers should exercise caution around motor bikes, as some motor bike drivers donâ€™t have driver's licenses and may not follow the rules of the road. Car rental, with or without a driver, can be arranged through major hotels. Honking to warn of your approach is considered a normal practice. Emergency roadside services are non-existent.

### Public transportation

Other than taxis, there is no public transportation. Taxi fares should be negotiated prior to departure.

There are few international airlines serving Sao Tome and Principe. International flights do not depart daily, making it difficult for travellers to quickly exit the country by air in case of an emergency.

### Piracy

Pirate attacks and armed robbery against ships occur in coastal waters and, in some cases, farther out at sea. Mariners should take appropriate precautions.
