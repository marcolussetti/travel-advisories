# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

The authorities of a country or territory decide who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Andorran authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for the duration of your stay in Andorra. Ensure your passport and other travel documents are also valid for transiting through the country of your choice.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

Andorra is not a member of the Schengen area. If you require a visa to enter the Schengen area and are planning to travel to Andorra, ensure you are in possession of a multiple-entry visa. Holders of a single-entry visa will face delays and may be refused re-entry when trying to return to France or Spain.

If you plan to stay in Andorra for a long-term stay, make sure you apply for the right residency permit.
