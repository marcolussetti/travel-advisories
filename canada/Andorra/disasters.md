## Natural disasters and climate

The weather in mountainous areas is highly unpredictable. Hazardous winter conditions, such as heavy snowfall, blizzards, freezing temperatures and avalanches, present a risk.

If you plan a mountain or skiing holiday, stay informed of the latest weather and safety conditions.
