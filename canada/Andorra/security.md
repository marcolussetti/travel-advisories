# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Crime

The crime rate is low. However, petty crimes such as pickpocketing and purse snatching may occur.

Ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times.

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in Europe. Terrorists have carried out attacks in several European cities.

Terrorist attacks could occur at any time.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places. Be particularly vigilant if attending sporting events, and during religious holidays and other public celebrations, as terrorists have used such occasions to mount attacks.

### Mountain activities

The Principality of Andorra is located in the Pyrenees mountain range. Mountain activities, such as hiking, can be dangerous if unprepared. Trails are not always marked, and weather conditions can change rapidly, even in summer.

In winter, heavy snowfall can make roads impassable. There is also a risk of avalanches, some of which can be fatal.

If you intend to go hiking, mountaineering or skiing:

* never do so alone
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* do not venture off marked trails or slopes
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* ensure that youâ€™re adequately equipped
* stay informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary
* know the symptoms of high-altitude illnesses, which can be fatal
* obtain detailed information on your activity and on the environment in which you will be doing it before setting out

### Road safety

Road conditions are very good. There are no major highways. Narrow, winding mountain roads pose risks year-round and could be impassable in winter.

### Public transportation

Public transportation is safe and reliable. There are public buses connecting the capital, Andorra la Vella, with other towns and villages of the principality.
