# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Political situation

Guinea-Bissau suffers from political instability. On February 2, 2022, there was a failed coup attempt at the Government Palace in Bissau. Although the situation is now calm, the political situation is volatile and further attacks against government and military personnel and installations cannot be ruled out.

### Area bordering Senegal

Casamance rebels are present in the area bordering Senegal, where the proliferation of small arms fuels banditry. It may be dangerous to cross this border by land.

### Bijagós Islands

To reach the Bijagós Islands from the mainland, you must use chartered air services or travel by boat. Avoid pirogues, as they are unsafe. There are tour operators that organize boat trips to the islands.

In the event of an emergency on the islands, contact the Embassy of Canada to Senegal, in Dakar.

### Crime

Crime rates are high.

Incidents of road banditry and carjacking pose a risk for travellers.

Avoid driving after dark, and always keep doors locked and windows rolled up.

Petty crime, including pickpocketing, is common at the airport, in markets and at public gatherings.

Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times.

Burglaries are regularly reported, and security is inadequate.

Avoid travelling at night and be particularly vigilant outside major cities.

### Demonstrations

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Road safety

Roads are poorly lit and poorly maintained. Do not leave the roads and pathways designated by local authorities because of the potential existence of minefields.

### General safety information

Although non-governmental organizations are clearing minefields, it is possible that unexploded ordnance and antipersonnel mines are still present outside Bissau, especially in the regions of Bafatá, Biombo, Oio, Quinara and Tombali.

Tourist facilities are limited.

Telecommunications are expensive and unreliable. Infrastructure is inadequate. Electricity and water supplies are often available for only a few hours a day.

### Air travel

We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.
