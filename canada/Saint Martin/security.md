## Safety and security

### Crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs. Burglaries occur in resorts, seaside homes, hotels and boats.

During your trip in Saint Martin:

* avoid carrying large sums of cash or showing signs of affluence
* keep valuables, travel documents, and cash in safe locations, such as in hotel safes
* make sure purses and handbags are closed and not easy to snatch
* avoid isolated or poorly-lit areas, including beaches
* don’t leave valuables unattended on the beach
* check with local authorities to determine which beaches are safe

#### Violent crime

Violent crime, including armed robbery, sometimes occurs. Criminals sometimes target tourists. Be aware of your surroundings and exercise caution, especially at night.

When using your bank card or credit card:

### Demonstrations and strikes

Demonstrations and strikes may cause disruptions to services. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Water activities

Coastal waters can be dangerous, and riptides are common. Beaches are unsupervised, and there is no flag warning system to provide notice of water conditions and safety risks. Water pollution is also a problem.

* Don’t swim alone
* Keep a safe distance from boats and restricted areas
* Consult residents and tour operators for information on possible hazards and safe swimming areas
* Don’t dive into unknown waters, as hidden rocks or shallow depths can cause serious injury or death

### Adventure tourism

Outdoor activities, such as zip-lining, hiking, mountain biking and other adventure activities can be dangerous if unprepared. Trails are not always marked, equipment safety inspections are not carried out regularly, and weather conditions can change rapidly, even in the summer.

If you intend to practice adventure tourism:

* never do so alone, and don’t part with your expedition companions
* obtain detailed information on your activity and on the environment in which you will be before setting out
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* stay informed of weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* refrain from using equipment if you have doubts about the safety
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary

### Road safety

The road network is well-maintained and it's possible to drive safely around the island.

There is severe traffic congestion during the tourist season, December to April.

The highway network consists of a belt that goes around both sides of the island, the French part, in Saint Martin, and the Dutch part, in Sint Maarten.

Canadian cell phones work throughout the country, and the network is reliable for emergency calls.

Emergency services, including roadside assistance, varies in availability depending on your rental company.

#### Road conditions

Driving conditions may be hazardous, especially during the rainy season, October to February.  Secondary and rural roads can be in poor condition.

#### Driving habits

Some drivers don’t respect traffic laws. They may be reckless.

Moped and scooter drivers sometimes engage in urban rodeos, riding on one wheel in front of other cars on the road. Such reckless behavior can be very dangerous for other drivers.
