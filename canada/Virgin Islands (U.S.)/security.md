## Safety and security

### Crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs.

* Ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Stay in hotels and resorts with good security
* Avoid isolated beaches and unpopulated areas, especially after dark

Violent crime is rare but also occurs.

### Women’s safety

### Power outages

The U.S. Virgin Islands regularly experience power outages.

Power outages often impact essential services, such as:

* telecommunications
* banking transactions
* the purchase of basic necessities

Not all buildings are equipped with generators.

* Keep a supply of water, food, fuel and an emergency kit on hand
* Monitor local media for the latest information

### Water activities

#### Swimming

Coastal waters can be dangerous. Riptides are common.

* Consult residents and tour operators for information on possible hazards and safe swimming areas
* Follow the instructions and warnings of local authorities

#### Diving

If you participate in water sports, such as diving:

* choose a well-established and reputable company that has insurance
* ensure that your travel insurance covers the recreational activities you choose

If in doubt concerning the safety of the facilities or equipment, don’t use them.

### Public transportation

#### Buses

There is reliable public bus service on the islands.

#### Taxis

Open-air “safari cabs” and taxis (usually SUVs or vans) are common on the islands of St. Thomas and St. John. Use authorized services and confirm the taxi fare with the driver before departing.

#### Ferries

There are passenger ferries between St. John and St. Thomas, as well as inter-island barges for transporting cars.

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety can vary greatly throughout the islands.

Due to the terrain, roads are often narrow and steep, and take sharp turns. They tend to be poorly paved.

Scooter accidents are common and often deadly. Avoid renting scooters on any of the islands.
