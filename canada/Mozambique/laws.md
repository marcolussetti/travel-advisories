### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Mozambique.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Mozambique, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Mozambique.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Mozambique by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Mozambique to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Dress and behaviour

### Money

The currency in Mozambique is the metical (MZN). The import or export of local currency is limited to a small amount of MZN.

When entering Mozambique, you must declare the amounts exceeding 10,000.00 USD or 10000 meticals in your possession. This includes:

* bank notes
* cheques
* traveller’s cheques

The U.S. dollar and South African rand are the easiest currencies to exchange in banks or exchange bureaus. Only use authorized currency exchange bureaus.

Credit cards are widely accepted in larger cities. However, most businesses outside major cities only accept payment in meticals, U.S. dollars or South African rand.

Hotels often only accept foreign currency.
