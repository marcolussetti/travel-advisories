# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Sporadic civil unrest

Since the general election on October 9, 2024, there have been political tensions and violent incidents in several areas throughout the country. Although the frequency and severity of demonstrations and rallies have decreased since mid-January, sporadic protests and clashes may still occur. Temporary roadblocks and road closures may happen with little to no notice.

[More information on demonstrations](#demonstrations)

### Cabo Delgado province

Militants continue to be active in several northern districts of Cabo Delgado. Violent clashes between militants and security forces occur frequently. Staged attacks against populated areas have targeted both security forces and civilians. Militants have burned villages, raided police stations, and conducted roadside ambushes and attacks with machetes and firearms against residents. This has resulted in hundreds of casualties and more than one million displaced persons.

There is a continued threat of kidnapping and criminal activity, such as contraband smuggling and illegal mining, in the entire province.

The Government of Canada’s ability to provide consular assistance to Canadians in Cabo Delgado Province is extremely limited.

Expect a heightened security presence in Cabo Delgado, especially in the northern and central districts.

### Nampula Province – Erati and Memba districts

Militants have committed attacks in the Erati and Memba districts in the Nampula province.

The situation is unpredictable and security forces have increased their presence throughout these areas.

### Border with South Africa

Increased traffic along the highway leading to and from the land border with South Africa has led to:

* frequent traffic congestion
* border crossing delays
* an increase in road accidents, robberies, theft and assaults targeting truck drivers and travellers.

If you cross at this land border:

* expect long line-ups and delays
* plan your trip accordingly
* keep your windows and doors locked at all times

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations and civil unrest can lead to violence and confrontations with security forces. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. Security forces may use tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds. Demonstrations can also lead to significant disruptions to traffic and public transportation. Essential services and supplies may also be disrupted.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing, muggings and purse snatching, occurs regularly in Mozambique, especially in Maputo. Travellers have been targeted at all hours of the day. Criminals will especially target individuals walking alone at night with bags, purses or visible items of value such as cell phones.

Theft of vehicle parts is frequent, especially around the holiday season, and occurs in these locations:

* shopping centers
* hotels
* transportation hubs

During your trip:

* ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* avoid showing signs of affluence or wearing expensive jewellery
* avoid leaving valuables in cars
* park your car in a secure area
* avoid walking alone in isolated areas, especially at night, even in well-known tourist areas
* stay in reputable hotels with good security measures

#### Violent crime

Violent crime, such as armed robbery and home burglary, occurs in and around large cities such as:

* Maputo/Matola
* Beira
* Nampula
* Nacala

During your trip:

* avoid travelling alone, especially at night
* keep your doors and windows locked at all times
* if threatened by robbers, don’t resist

Tourists are usually not targeted, however you could be at the wrong place at the wrong time.

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism, particularly in certain parts of the Cabo Delgado and Nampula provinces where insurgent militants continue to operate and commit attacks. Militants are especially active in the central and northern districts of Mocimboa de Praia, Macomia, Muidumbe and Palma.

Further attacks are likely.

Targets could include:

* vehicle convoys travelling between towns
* pedestrians and civilian residences in rural villages
* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

### Kidnapping

Kidnapping for ransom occurs in larger cities such as Maputo City, Matola and Beira.

While most victims are locals perceived as wealthy, foreigners have been targeted. Kidnappers frequently operate during the day.

Kidnappings also occur regularly in Cabo Delgado province. Foreign nationals and workers have been targeted. Further incidents are likely.

* Be aware of your surroundings at all times
* Change your travel patterns regularly
* Avoid showing signs of affluence
* If threatened by kidnappers, do not resist

### Road safety

Road safety varies considerably across the country. Fatal accidents are common, and they often involve pedestrians. Fuel stations are rare in rural areas and police assistance can be unreliable.

#### Road conditions

Road conditions can vary greatly throughout the country. The streets are paved in Maputo and major cities but are usually crowded and narrow. Highways in the south and west of the country are generally well maintained but can be affected by seasonal weather conditions.

Driving conditions may be hazardous during the rainy season from December to April, and sometimes near-zero visibility poses a threat. You may need a four-wheel-drive vehicle to travel outside cities and off major highways.

Driving outside major cities can also be dangerous due to:

* lack of guardrails
* inadequate or non-existing street lighting
* lack of signage
* pedestrians walking on main roads
* stray livestock

#### Driving habits

Drivers often don't respect traffic laws. They often drive at excessive speeds and have little consideration for pedestrians and other drivers' right of way. Drinking and driving may occur at any time of the day or night.

After a car accident, a large crowd may gather at the scene of the incident and become hostile. If this happens, get away from the scene and go to the nearest police station.

On the road in Mozambique:

* keep doors locked and windows closed at all times
* don't expect drivers to look out for pedestrians
* avoid travelling after dark, especially outside of major urban areas
* carry a cellphone and a charger with you
* maintain a full tank of gas
* keep a supply of water and non-perishable snacks

#### Checkpoints

Police checkpoints are common throughout the country. Only national police officers have the authority to establish checkpoints.

Traffic law enforcement consists of stationary traffic police officers on foot. They randomly stop vehicles for inspections or identification. Failure to produce identification documents can result in a large fine.

* Be prepared to present copies of your identification documents
* Don’t challenge the authority of requesting officials

#### Extortion

There are reports of widespread corruption among the police ranks. Police officers sometimes try to extort drivers and pedestrians by threatening detention or confiscating identity documents. If you don’t carry proper documentation, the police may attempt to bribe you. They may also ask for items or tips.

If police threaten you with a fine:

* remain calm and courteous but firm
* show original documents but keep them in your possession
* try to cooperate by following the instructions of the police to avoid escalation
* ask for a clear explanation of the offence and a written fine that can be paid at a police station
* don’t pay a bribe or tips to anyone

### Shortages

Fuel shortages occur occasionally.

* Never let your tank go lower than half-full
* Keep fuel supplies on hand
* Carefully plan all road travel

### Public transportation

Public transportation is limited.

#### Buses

Privately owned minibuses, known as chapas, are often overcrowded and poorly maintained. They are frequently involved in fatal accidents.

Private intercity buses are available, especially to South African destinations. They are often better maintained and only operate on roads in good conditions.

#### Taxis

Taxis are widely available.

If you use a taxi in Mozambique:

* avoid hailing it on the street
* only use registered taxis from reputable providers, preferably arranged through your hotel
* avoid yellow and green taxis, in which there are reports of thefts
* ensure that there is no other passenger in the car

#### Train

Domestic rail service is overcrowded and slow.

### Piracy

Pirate attacks and armed robbery against ships occur in coastal waters of the Indian Ocean. Mariners should take appropriate precautions.
