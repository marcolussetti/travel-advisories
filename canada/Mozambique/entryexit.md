# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

The authorities of a country or territory decide who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from Mozambican authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country's entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid at least 6 months beyond the date you expect to leave Mozambique.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

You should also be aware that current systems used by some countries and travel companies may not recognize the “X” gender identifier. You may still be asked to provide your sex/gender information as either male or female when travelling.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Visas

Tourist visa: not required for stays up to 30 days  
 Business visa: not required for stays up to 30 days  
Visitor visa: required when visiting by way of private invitation (from an individual or organization)  
 Work visa: required  
 Student visa: required  
 Residency visa: required

You can apply for a visa at the nearest Mozambican embassy or consulate or obtain an e-visa pre-authorization through Mozambique’s official e-visa portal.

#### Tourist and business visa exemption

You may enter Mozambique for tourism or business without a visa for up to 30 days; however, you must present the following upon arrival:

* an Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA) obtained at least 48 hours before departure
* a return or onward ticket (except for travel by land)
* a passport valid for at least 6 months beyond the expected departure date, with at least 2 blank pages
* a payment of the fee paid by card or cash
* proof of accommodation

Keep the receipt provided upon arrival as part of the visa exemption policy.

If you encounter a technical issue with the ETA and e-visa portal, keep proof of the error and contact the nearest embassy or consulate of Mozambique for guidance.

#### Extending your visa

You may request one extension of 30 days from immigration authorities. Visa-free travel only applies to stays of up to 90 days in a year. Justification for the extended stay may be required, and fees may apply. If your passport has less than 6 months validity, Mozambican authorities may refuse to extend your visa exemption.

Overstaying without authorization may result in fines.

#### Visa pre-authorizations

If you’re not eligible for the visa exemption, you can apply for an e-visa pre-authorization through the Government of Mozambique’s e-visa and ETA portal.

Visa pre-authorizations are only available for:

* crew members
* humanitarian workers
* sports and cultural activity participants
* eligible investors

Visa pre-authorizations are not guaranteed visas. You must submit all required documents to immigration authorities for a final decision.

Visa fees can be paid on arrival by credit card or in accepted currencies.

#### Other entry requirements

Customs officials may ask you to show them a return or onward ticket and proof of accommodation.

Make sure customs officials properly inspect and stamp your passport and visa upon entry to avoid possible fines when leaving the country. If you overstay your authorized visa period, you may be fined for each day you illegally reside in Mozambique.

### Children and travel

If you are transiting by road through South Africa with children under the age of 18, you may be subject to special entry requirements.
