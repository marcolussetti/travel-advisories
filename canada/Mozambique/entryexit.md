# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

The authorities of a country or territory decide who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from Mozambican authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid at least 6 months beyond the date you expect to leave Mozambique.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with a “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

You should also be aware that current systems used by some countries and travel companies may not recognize the “X” gender identifier. You may still be asked to provide your sex/gender information as either male or female when travelling.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

Business visa: not required for stays up to 30 days (may be extended)  
Work visa: required  
Student visa: required  
Residency visa: required

You can apply for a visa at the nearest embassy or consulate of Mozambique.

#### Tourist and business visa exemption

Canadian tourists and business travellers may be exempt from applying for a visa under certain conditions. The requirement for visa-exempt travellers to apply for an Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA) is currently suspended.

Trips of more than 30 days require an extension of stay from immigration authorities. Administrative fees may apply. If your passport has less than 6 months validity, Mozambican authorities may refuse to extend your visa exemption.

Upon arrival, you must provide:

* a return or onward ticket (except for travel by land)
* a passport valid for at least 6 months beyond the date you expect to leave Mozambique
* a payment of 650 Mozambican meticals or equivalent in accepted currencies, paid by card or cash
* proof of accommodation

#### Visa pre-authorizations

If you’re not eligible for the visa exemption, you can apply for an e-visa pre-authorization for certain types of visas through the Government of Mozambique’s e-visa portal.

Visa pre-authorizations are only available for the following types of visas:

* crew member travel
* humanitarian assistance efforts
* sports and cultural activity participation
* border and investment.

Visa pre-authorizations are not guaranteed visas. Upon arrival to Mozambique, you must submit all required documents to immigration authorities for a final decision.

You can pay the fees on arrival with a credit card or local currency.

### Other entry requirements

Customs officials may ask you to show them a return or onward ticket and proof of accommodation.

Make sure customs officials properly inspect and stamp your passport and visa upon entry to avoid possible fines when leaving the country. If you overstay your authorized visa period, you may be fined for each day you illegally reside in Mozambique.

### Children and travel

If you are transiting by road through South Africa with children under the age of 18, you may be subject to special entry requirements.
