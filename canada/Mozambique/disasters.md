## Natural disasters and climate

Since January 2026, heavy rains have caused severe flooding and landslides, resulting in casualties and significant damage to buildings and infrastructure.

Starting February 13, 2026, Tropical Cyclone Gezani will impact the eastern coastal provinces of Sofala, Inhambame and Gaza.

The storm is likely to bring excessive rainfall and violent winds. It may cause flash flooding and landslides.

Essential services, already affected by previous floods, could be further disrupted in the coming days, including:

* transportation
* power distribution
* telecommunication networks

If you're in or around an affected area:

* exercise caution and avoid flooded roads and low-lying areas
* monitor local news and weather reports
* confirm the status of roads with local authorities before travelling
* follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders
