# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs. Incidents usually increase just before and during annual festivities, such as Carnival in August.

* Ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Never leave valuables such as money, credit cards and electronics unattended, especially on beaches and in vehicles
* Carry a photocopy of the identification page of your passport
* Don’t carry large amounts of cash
* Use caution when using ATMs, especially after dusk

There has been an increase in thefts from yachts docked and anchored along the south coast of Grenada. Criminals target belongings, cash and navigation equipment such as outboard engines.

* Remain vigilant if travelling by yacht
* Avoid travelling between and around eastern Caribbean islands at night, as these areas may be unsafe and robberies can occur

### Women’s safety

Sexual assault against female travellers occurs.

Women travelling alone may also be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse.

### Water activities

Coastal waters can be dangerous. Riptides are common.

Not all beaches have lifeguards or warning flags.

Rescue services may not be consistent with international standards.

If you practice water activities:

* follow the instructions and warnings of local authorities
* consult residents and tour operators for information on possible hazards and safe swimming areas
* wear the appropriate safety equipment, such as helmets and life jackets
* ensure that equipment is available and in good condition

### Hiking

If you intend on hiking:

* never do so alone and always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* ensure that you’re properly equipped and well informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary
* obtain detailed information on hiking routes before setting out and do not venture off marked trails

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations may occur. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety are poor throughout the country.

Most roads are narrow and winding. Blind corners are common on mountain roads. Potholes, speedbumps and poor lighting pose a hazard. Road surfaces often deteriorate during periods of intense heat and during the hurricane season.

Drivers often drive at high speeds.

Roadside assistance is not widely available.

* Exercise caution when driving, particularly after dark
* Look out for pedestrians, who often walk on the road
* Do not stop if flagged down by a pedestrian, since they may attempt to rob you

### Public transportation

#### Taxis

Taxis are available on Grenada, Carriacou and Petite Martinique islands.

Standard taxi fares exist for most destinations.

* Only use licensed taxis, whose licence plates should begin with the letter H
* Confirm the fare before departing

#### Minibuses

A network of safe minibuses operates at fixed fares throughout the islands of Grenada and Carriacou. Most routes start and end at the bus terminal in St. Georges.

#### Ferries and water taxis

Ferry services are available between Grenada, Carriacou and Petite Martinique.

Water taxis operate between tourist hotels on Grand Anse beach and the capital.
