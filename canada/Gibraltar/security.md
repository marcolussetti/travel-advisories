## Safety and security

### Crime

Although the crime rate is low, petty crime such as pickpocketing and purse snatching occurs. Unattended vehicles are occasional targets of thieves.

People walking at night between La Línea de la Concepción, Spain, and Gibraltar have been attacked and robbed.

* Ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Avoid leaving luggage or valuables unattended in your vehicle
* Use secure parking facilities

### Spiked food and drinks

Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations may occur. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in Europe. Terrorists have carried out attacks in several European cities. Terrorist attacks could occur at any time.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* the airport and other transportation networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

The Government of the United Kingdom maintains a public alert system on terrorism in Gibraltar and communicates threat level changes online and through local media.

### Swimming and water activities

Coastal waters can be dangerous. Always obey warning flags at beaches.

In marine areas, coral, jellyfish and other ocean life found along reefs can poison, sting or cause infection if touched or stepped on.

* Ask local authorities about the presence of such species and whether they are dangerous
* Immediately seek medical assistance if you get hurt

In the fall and winter months, be cautious when walking along beaches close to the water’s edge as waves can be unpredictable in size and may come onto shore further than expected.

* Don’t visit beaches or coastal areas during periods of severe weather warnings
* Look out for signs warning of cliff erosion and falling rocks
* Don’t dive into unknown waters, as hidden rocks or shallow depths can cause serious injury or death
* Exercise caution and follow the advice of the local authorities

### Wildlife

Large groups of Barbary macaques are present in Gibraltar. It’s illegal to feed them.

Macaques can get aggressive and rapidly overwhelm travellers in their search for food. They can also steal your belongings.

* Always maintain a safe distance when observing macaques
* Don’t feed them as you may be heavily fined

### Road safety

Travellers may experience delays crossing between Gibraltar and Spain due to increased border controls.

* Be sure you are prepared for lengthy delays
* Plan for an adequate supply of fuel, food, and water

### Public transportation

The public bus system is safe and reliable.

Taxis are generally safe.

* Use only officially marked taxis
* Negotiate fares in advance, or insist that the driver use the meter, as you may be overcharged
