## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Transfer of Sentenced Persons

Canada and France are signatories to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in France or a French territory to request a transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both Canadian and French authorities.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect jail sentences and heavy fines.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in France.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of France, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and France.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in New Caledonia, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the New Caledonian court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in New Caledonia to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Driving

You should carry an international driving permit. If you reside in New Caledonia, you may be able to exchange your Canadian licence for a local permit.

### Dress and behaviour

To avoid offending local sensitivities:

* dress conservatively outside of tourist areas
* behave discreetly
* respect religious and social traditions

### Money

The currency is the Comptoirs français du Pacifique franc or the CFP franc (XPF).

ATMs and credit card facilities are widely available in Nouméa. If travelling to remote areas, bring a sufficient supply of cash.

On arrival and departure, you must declare if carrying any combination of currencies amounting to 10,000 Euro or more.
