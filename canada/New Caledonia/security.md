## Safety and security

### Political situation and civil unrest

In May 2024, demonstrations against constitutional reforms became violent in New Caledonia. Arson and looting took place during the riots.

The situation remains volatile and could escalate without notice.

There is a heightened presence of police and security forces. Authorities may impose restrictions, including curfews, at short notice.

If you are in New Caledonia:

* exercise caution
* monitor local media for the latest information
* follow the instructions of local authorities

### Crime

Petty crime is prevalent. Car theft and vehicle break-ins also occur. Ensure that your personal belongings, including passports and other travel documents, are secure at all times.

### Spiked food and drinks

Drink spiking occurs. Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations occur frequently. Roadblocks and marches may occur on main roads at any time and with little or no notice. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Public transportation

Buses connect all major towns and villages. There is a ferry service between Nouméa and other islands.

### Adventure activities

Safety standards for adventure activities, such as diving, may not be up to international standards. If engaging in adventure activities:

* never do so alone and always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* ensure that you are properly equipped and well informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary, including when you expect to be back to camp
* ensure the company, operator or guide you are using is properly certified
* inspect equipment to make sure it is in proper working condition and use all available safety equipment, such as harnesses, life jackets or helmets

### Water activities

#### Swimming

In certain areas, like Nouméa, sharks pose a risk to swimmers. To reduce the risk of deadly shark attacks, local authorities have set up temporary supervised swimming areas.

* Follow the instructions and warnings of lifeguards
* Respect the flag warning system, which provides notice of water conditions and safety risks on beaches
* Follow the directives of local authorities

### Road safety

All main roads on Grande Terre are paved. Intoxicated and unlicensed drivers pose a hazard on the roads. Cars are often poorly maintained and uninsured. Poor lighting, wandering livestock and pedestrians on the road pose a hazard at night on secondary roads.

Incidents of road blockages, carjacking and objects being thrown at vehicles, while not frequent, do occur and can be very dangerous.
