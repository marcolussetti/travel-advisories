New Caledonia is located in an active seismic zone. Tsunamis may occur after a strong earthquake and can travel long distances across the Pacific.

In case of an earthquake, follow the instructions of local authorities.

### Wildfires

Bush and forest fires are common between September and February. In case of a major fire, stay away from the affected area. Always follow the instructions of local emergency services personnel. Monitor local media for up-to-date information on the situation.
