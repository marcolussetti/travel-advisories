## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect immediate detention and lengthy jail terms.

All departing visitors are thoroughly screened for drugs by the Bolivarian National Guard. Pack your luggage yourself and keep it with you at all times. Don’t carry anything through customs for anyone else.

You must carry your passport at all times.

Photography of sensitive installations, including the presidential palace, military sites, government buildings and airports, is prohibited.

### Importations

You must declare imports worth more than US$1,000 to customs officials and pay appropriate taxes.

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Venezuela.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Venezuela, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Venezuela.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Venezuela, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Venezuelan court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Venezuela to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Driving

Stopping at Bolivarian National Guard of Venezuela and police checkpoints is mandatory. There are many control points throughout the country. Follow all instructions and have vehicle and insurance papers and passports readily available.

Vehicles may be searched. It is not uncommon for authorities to seek bribes.

In the case of an accident, don’t move your vehicle until a traffic police officer fills out a report. Police response times are often slow.

You should carry an international driving permit.

### Money

The currency in Venezuela is the Venezuelan bolivar (Bs or VEF). It can be difficult to obtain local currency.

US dollars are widely accepted.

Carry small bank notes to facilitate daily transactions.

You must change money at the official government rate.

Banks often restrict transactions to their clients only. Official exchange houses are scarce outside of major cities and the law prohibits the sale and purchase of any foreign currency outside of authorized institutions. You are subject to a fine if you are caught exchanging foreign currency outside of authorized institutions. Very few exchange houses or banks will exchange bolívars outside Venezuela.

You cannot rely on wire transfers as a source of emergency funds.

Cash withdrawals from foreign bank accounts at ATMs are not possible. Malfunctions and insufficient cash are recurring problems. Many ATMs don’t accept international credit cards or ask for additional codes to confirm identity.

* Change your money in the official exchange offices only
* Don’t use the black market
* Only U.S. dollars can be exchanged

Identification is required for a credit card transaction.

If you are entering or leaving Venezuela with more than US$10,000, you are required to declare it to the authorities.
