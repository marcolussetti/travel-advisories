# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Venezuelan authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond the date you expect to leave Venezuela.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Visas

Tourist visa: required  
Business visa: required  
Work visa: required  
Student visa: required

Venezuelan authorities strictly enforce entry requirements. You must obtain a visa before travelling to Venezuela. Visas are not available upon arrival. Penalties for entering Venezuela without a valid visa are severe, including potentially lengthy detention or imprisonment.

### Other entry requirements

Customs officials may ask you to show them a return or onward ticket and proof of sufficient funds to cover your stay.

Ensure that you receive an entrance stamp in your passport from Venezuela’s immigration office at the port of entry.

### Dual citizenship

Canadian citizens who also hold Venezuelan citizenship must enter and exit Venezuela using a Venezuelan passport.

Children born outside Venezuela to Venezuelan parents are assumed to be Venezuelan citizens and must also enter and exit the country using a Venezuelan passport.

Although immigration authorities have allowed dual citizens to enter without a Venezuelan passport, they have later prevented them from leaving the country.

#### Venezuelan documents

It is very difficult to obtain a new Venezuelan passport or to extend an expired passport. As a result, you may not be able to obtain a passport in Venezuela for your Canadian-born child.

If you are a dual citizen and planning to travel to Venezuela, make sure your Venezuelan passport is valid beyond the duration of your trip. If you need to renew your passport or obtain a new one for your Canadian-born child, contact the nearest Venezuelan embassy or consulate to make arrangements.

If you enter Venezuela with an expired Venezuelan passport, authorities may not stamp your travel documents upon entry. This may lead to difficulties when exiting the country.
