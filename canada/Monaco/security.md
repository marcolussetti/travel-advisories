## Safety and security

### Crime

The crime rate in Monaco is lower than in most European countries. Nevertheless, be vigilant in tourist areas and transit links such as train stations.

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and bag snatching, may occur.

Keep your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, in a secure place.

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in Europe. Terrorists have carried out attacks in several European cities and further attacks are likely.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including police stations
* schools, including universities
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners
* cultural venues

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

Be particularly vigilant during:

* sporting events
* religious holidays
* public celebrations
* major political events, such as elections

Terrorists may use such occasions to mount attacks.
