* Always carry valid identification or a photocopy of it
* Keep a photocopy of your passport and your visa or travel permit in a safe place in case it’s lost or seized
* Keep a digital copy of your identification and travel documents

### Photography

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in the Comoros.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of the Comoros, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and the Comoros.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in the Comoros by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in the Comoros to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.
