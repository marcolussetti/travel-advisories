## Natural disasters and climate

### Climate change

Climate change is affecting the Comoros. Extreme and unusual weather events are becoming more frequent and may affect your travel plans. Monitor local media for the latest information.

### Rainy season

Monsoons and rarer tropical cyclones usually occur during the hot and humid rainy season, which runs from December to April. During this period, even small storms can quickly develop into major monsoons.

Seasonal flooding can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services, especially in rural areas. Roads may become impassable due to mudslides and landslides. Infrastructure may be damaged.

* Monitor local media for the latest information, including on road conditions
* Stay away from flooded areas
* Monitor weather reports
* Follow instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders

The Comoros archipelago is located in an active seismic and volcanic zone. Mount Karthala is an active volcano near Moroni. Eruptions can occur at any time.

If you are planning to hike on or around Mount Karthala:

* consult local authorities before travelling
* monitor levels of volcanic activity through the local media
