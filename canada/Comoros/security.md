# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Crime

Although infrequent, petty crime such as pickpocketing, purse snatching and theft from unlocked cars occurs.

* Exercise caution in crowded outdoor markets, parks and beaches
* Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Avoid walking alone at night

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations may occur, especially before, during and after elections. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation. Curfew orders can be declared with minimal notice.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Swimming

Coastal waters can be dangerous, even for experienced swimmers. Riptides are common. Several drownings occur each year. Beaches are generally unsupervised. There is no warning system to alert of unsafe conditions.

### Roads

#### Road safety

There are major road safety issues in the Comoros. Fatal accidents are common and often involve pedestrians. Police and emergency services assistance is limited in Grande Comore and extremely limited in Mohéli and Anjouan.

#### Road conditions

Road conditions are poor throughout the country. Most main roads are paved, while secondary roads are not.

Driving can be dangerous due to:

* poorly maintained roads and potholes
* narrow and curved roads
* stray animals
* lack of signage
* pedestrians walking on main roads
* insufficient or non-existent lighting and vehicles not using their headlights
* poorly maintained vehicles

#### Driving habits

Drivers don’t always respect traffic laws and speeding is common. Priority is not given to pedestrians or other drivers.

If you choose to drive in the Comoros:

* avoid driving after dark
* always drive defensively
* fill your gas tank before you travel
* always carry a cellphone and charger

### Public transportation

Public transportation is limited, unreliable, crowded and sometimes unsafe.

#### Taxis

Taxis and car rentals are preferable to public transportation.

If you use taxi services:

* ask for your taxi at the front desk if you’re using hotel services
* make sure the driver does not pick up other passengers on the way to your destination
* negotiate the fare in advance
* have small bills available for payment

If you decide to rent a car:

* only use service providers recommended by a trusted contact
* consider renting a car with a hired driver rather than driving yourself

#### Maritime transportation

It’s possible to travel among the Comoros islands by boat. Ferry accidents have occurred due to poor maintenance, overcrowding, lack of security equipment and measures.

If you choose to travel by ferry:

* make sure the vessel you are boarding is carrying appropriate safety equipment and that life jackets are provided for all passengers and accessible at all times
* don’t board vessels that appear overloaded or unseaworthy
* verify the safety standards of ferries with your tour operator
* avoid using water transportation during bad weather conditions

### Shortages

#### Fuel shortages

Fuel shortages occur occasionally.

Local authorities may impose rationing measures for fuel. These measures could lead to a reduction of essential services and line-ups at gas stations.

* Never let your tank go lower than half-full
* Keep a supply of fuel on hand
* Carefully plan all road travel

#### Power outages

Power outages occur regularly across the islands. Local authorities may implement power cuts to conserve power.

#### Water shortages

Due to below-average rainfall in the recent years, the Comoros experience regular water shortages.

### Women safety

Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse.

2SLGBTQI+ persons could be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or sex characteristics.

and could be victim of harassment and verbal or physical violence. Avoid public display of affection.

### Piracy

Pirate attacks and armed robbery against ships occur in coastal waters and, in some cases, farther out at sea. Mariners should take appropriate precautions.
