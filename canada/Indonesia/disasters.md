### Climate change

Climate change is affecting Indonesia. Extreme and unusual weather events are becoming more frequent and may affect your travel plans. Indonesia is located in a very active seismic zone and is prone to natural disasters such as:

* earthquakes
* tsunamis
* flooding
* volcanic eruptions
* drought

Monitor local media for the latest information.

### Earthquakes and tsunamis

Each year, Indonesia experiences thousands of earthquakes. Some trigger tsunamis and cause significant damage. Deaths and injuries occasionally occur.

A tsunami can occur within minutes of a nearby earthquake. However, the risk of tsunami can remain for several hours following the first tremor. If you're staying on the coast, familiarize yourself with the region's evacuation plans in the event of a tsunami warning.

### Volcanoes

Indonesia has 129 active volcanoes and periodically experiences major volcanic events that can be dangerous, even life-threatening. Ash clouds can disrupt air travel, including on the island of Bali, and cause or worsen respiratory problems. Rain near volcanos can cause dangerous floods, called ‘lahar’ or cold lava floods, that contain volcanic debris.

Concerning volcanic activity is ongoing in the following areas:

* Mount Ibu volcano on Halmahera Island in North Maluku province
* Mount Lewotobi Laki-Laki volcano on Flores Island in East Nusa Tenggara province
* Mount Merapi volcano on Java Island on the border between the province of Central Java and the Special Region of Yogyakarta

Active volcanoes are monitored to provide residents with an early warning should unusual activity occur. Local authorities can raise alert levels and order evacuations on short notice.

If you are near active volcanoes:

* take official warnings seriously and respect exclusion zones
* monitor local media to stay up-to-date on latest developments
* follow the advice of local authorities, including evacuation orders
* be prepared to modify your travel arrangements or even evacuate the area on short notice

### Rainy season

The rainy season extends from November to March, but heavy rains are common throughout the year. Flooding and landslides can occur with little warning, especially in remote areas where extensive deforestation is common, but also in major cities, including Jakarta and various parts of Bali. Such incidents have led to fatalities and destruction of property.

Seasonal flooding can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable and bridges damaged.

* Be aware of health risks associated with flood waters
* Keep informed of regional weather forecasts as well as road closures or detours
* Avoid disaster areas
* Follow the advice of local authorities

### Air pollution

Unrestricted burning in Sumatra and Kalimantan sometimes causes air pollution to rise to unhealthy levels, especially from June to October.

Monitor air pollution levels closely, as they change quickly.

During periods of high pollution:

* limit your activities outdoors
* monitor local media
* follow the instructions of local authorities
