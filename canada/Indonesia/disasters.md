### Flooding and landslides in North Sumatra

Heavy rainfall has caused severe flooding and landslides across North Sumatra, especially in Lake Toba and mountainous districts.

Rain storms have resulted in flash floods, significant damage to homes and infrastructure, as well as casualties.

Roadways may be blocked by landslides or flood water. Local authorities may suspend transportation services due to landslide debris and unsafe conditions.

If you are in an affected area:

* move to higher ground, away from rivers and low-lying areas
* monitor local news and weather reports
* confirm your flight before going to the airport
* follow the instructions of local authorities

### Climate change

Climate change is affecting Indonesia. Extreme and unusual weather events are becoming more frequent and may affect your travel plans. Indonesia is located in a very active seismic zone and is prone to natural disasters such as:

* earthquakes
* tsunamis
* flooding
* volcanic eruptions
* drought

Monitor local media for the latest information.

### Earthquakes and tsunamis

Each year, Indonesia experiences thousands of earthquakes. Some trigger tsunamis and cause significant damage. Deaths and injuries occasionally occur.

A tsunami can occur within minutes of a nearby earthquake. However, the risk of tsunami can remain for several hours following the first tremor. If you're staying on the coast, familiarize yourself with the region's evacuation plans in the event of a tsunami warning.

### Volcanoes

### Mount Semeru eruption

On November 19, 2025, a significant volcanic eruption occured at Mount Semeru in Lumajang Regency, East Java. The region is also experiencing increased seismic activity.

Indonesian authorities have evacuated the surrounding areas.

A large volcanic ash cloud could disrupt air traffic and cause flight delays or cancellations.

Indonesia has 129 active volcanoes and periodically experiences major volcanic events that can be dangerous, even life-threatening. Ash clouds can disrupt air travel, including on the island of Bali, and cause or worsen respiratory problems. Rain near volcanos can cause dangerous floods, called ‘lahar’ or cold lava floods, that contain volcanic debris.

Concerning volcanic activity is ongoing in the following areas:

* Mount Ibu volcano on Halmahera Island in North Maluku province
* Mount Lewotobi Laki-Laki volcano on Flores Island in East Nusa Tenggara province
* Mount Merapi volcano on Java Island on the border between the province of Central Java and the Special Region of Yogyakarta
* Mount Semeru volcano on Java Island in East Java Province

Active volcanoes are monitored to provide residents with an early warning should unusual activity occur. Local authorities can raise alert levels and order evacuations on short notice.

If you are near active volcanoes:

* take official warnings seriously and respect exclusion zones
* monitor local media to stay up-to-date on latest developments
* follow the advice of local authorities, including evacuation orders
* be prepared to modify your travel arrangements or even evacuate the area on short notice

### Rainy season

The rainy season extends from November to March, but heavy rains are common throughout the year. Flooding and landslides can occur with little warning, especially in remote areas where extensive deforestation is common, but also in major cities, including Jakarta and various parts of Bali. Such incidents have led to fatalities and destruction of property.

Seasonal flooding can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable and bridges damaged.

* Be aware of health risks associated with flood waters
* Keep informed of regional weather forecasts as well as road closures or detours
* Avoid disaster areas
* Follow the advice of local authorities

### Air pollution

Unrestricted burning in Sumatra and Kalimantan sometimes causes air pollution to rise to unhealthy levels, especially from June to October.

Monitor air pollution levels closely, as they change quickly.

During periods of high pollution:

* limit your activities outdoors
* monitor local media
* follow the instructions of local authorities
