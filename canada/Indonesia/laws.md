### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences. They can also be detained for long periods, without the possibility of release on bail, while police conduct investigations prior to prosecution.

Police have arrested tourists after random drug testing throughout the country.

### Medicine

Some prescription and over-the-counter medications that are legal in Canada, such as those containing morphine and codeine, are classified as controlled substances in Indonesia. It’s illegal to bring them into the country, even in small quantities, without prior permission from the Indonesian Ministry of Health and the required documentation.

If you attempt to bring banned pharmaceuticals into Indonesia without prior authorization and proper documentation, Indonesian authorities may confiscate them. You may also be subject to fines and imprisonment.

### Sharia law

In some areas, Islamic practices and beliefs closely adhere to local customs, laws and regulations.

Religious police enforce sharia law in Aceh. Specific applications of sharia may differ by region and apply to non-Muslims as well.

Be aware of the relevant provisions specifically related to the region, regardless of your religion.

### Dress and behaviour

To avoid offending local sensitivities:

* dress conservatively
* behave discreetly
* respect religious and social traditions

### Ramadan

In 2026, the lunar month of Ramadan is expected to begin on or around February 17.

In public, between sunrise and sunset, be discreet when:

* drinking
* eating
* smoking

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Indonesian national law doesn't criminalize sexual acts or relationships between persons of the same sex. However, they are prohibited and punishable under local laws in some provinces.

In Aceh, Sharia law is enforced and sexual acts between Muslim individuals of the same sex is punished by caning. They could also face arrest under charges related to immoral behaviour, prostitution or social ills.

2SLGBTQI+ persons could be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression or sex characteristics.

2SLGBTQI+ persons should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Indonesia.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Indonesia.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of Indonesia, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

Indonesia allows minors to carry dual citizenship until the age of 18. After this time, they must choose between their Indonesian citizenship and foreign citizenship.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Indonesia.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Indonesia by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Indonesia to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.
