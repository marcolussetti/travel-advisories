# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

The authorities of a country or territory decide who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Indonesian authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country's entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond the date of entry into Indonesia and must contain at least one blank page for the placement of the Indonesian visa or entry stamp.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

You should also be aware that current systems used by some countries and travel companies may not recognize the “X” gender identifier. You may still be asked to provide your sex/gender information as either male or female when travelling.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Visas

Tourist visa: required  
 Business visa: required  
 Social-cultural visit visa: required

Indonesia strictly enforces its immigration and visa requirements. Foreign travellers have been detained in immigration detention centres for visa violations or overstays. Those in violation may be subject to substantial fines and deportation.

A round-trip or onward airline ticket is required to obtain all types of visas.

There is an increase in visa scams in Indonesia, including in Bali.

* Do not accept unsolicited offers for visa extensions, as you could be at risk of:

+ overstaying your visa
+ legal consequences such as fines, deportation or re-entry bans

* Never hand over your passport to individuals or agencies claiming to offer visa services
* Use official government channels to manage or renew visas and ensure your information and documents remain secure

#### Tourist visa

If you are travelling for tourism with a regular Canadian passport, you may obtain a visa in advance or on arrival at select points of entry.

#### Business and social-cultural visas

If you are travelling to Indonesia for business or social-cultural purposes (e.g. volunteer work), you must obtain a visa prior to your arrival. You must provide a letter from both the sponsoring organization in Indonesia and the sending organization in Canada to obtain your visa.

A business or social-cultural single-entry visa is extendable from within Indonesia.

#### Seamless Corridor Registration

Indonesian airports are introducing “Seamless Corridors” to speed up immigration clearance. This service requires your biometric data as well as your passport and flight information. Once you’re enrolled, you can use the designated lanes without presenting your passport or boarding pass.

#### Aid workers

Aid workers must have a sponsor in Indonesia to obtain a visa. Those going to Aceh also require prior authorization from the Directorate General of Immigration in Aceh or Jakarta.

#### Journalists

Journalists visiting Indonesia for reporting and filming purposes must obtain authorization from the Directorate General of Immigration in Jakarta before applying for a visa.

#### All Indonesia Declaration Form

Indonesia has introduced the All Indonesia Declaration Form, which combines customs and health declarations into a single form. The trial phase has begun at Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, Juanda International Airport and Ngurah Rai International Airport, and runs from August 18 to September 30, 2025. The form will become mandatory on October 1, 2025.

The Health Declaration or SATUSEHAT Health Pass (SSHP) QR codes may still be used to enter Indonesia until they are discontinued on October 1, 2025.

You must complete the form before you check in for your flight to Indonesia. Once you have submitted the SSHP form, you’ll receive a barcode. Save or print out a copy of the barcode for Indonesian authorities to scan upon arrival before September 30, 2025.

Existing QR codes for the Electronic Customs Declaration can be used until they are discontinued on October 1, 2025.

You must complete either the online All Indonesia Declaration Form or both the Electronic Customs Declaration and Health Declaration forms up to 72 hours before you arrive in Indonesia. You can also fill it out at customs at major airports on arrival but you will not be allowed to clear immigration, regardless of the type of visa you have, without completing the form.

Customs officials may ask you to show them a return or onward ticket and proof of sufficient funds to cover your stay.
