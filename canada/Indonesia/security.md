# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Indonesian Papua

Political tension and regular violent incidents continue to occur in most of Indonesian Papua.

In February 2023, militant groups threatened to attack and take hostages, specifically referencing foreigners. You may also face increased threats of violence or kidnapping if you travel to Indonesian Papua.

Labour disputes at a mine near Timika have led to demonstrations, public transportation disruptions and violence.

Fatal attacks have occurred on roads near the mine. Foreigners have been targeted by local militants.

There is a heightened police and military presence in this area.

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in Indonesia.

While effective counterterrorism measures by Indonesian authorities are in place, terrorist cells are active and have the capacity to carry out attacks throughout the country.

Attacks have targeted:

* military and government facilities
* tourist attractions and popular public places
* nightclubs and entertainment venues
* public transportation
* airports

Further attacks are likely, and terrorists may also target:

* crowded places
* places with high pedestrian traffic and where foreigners may gather
* commercial establishments
* local government offices
* public transit stations
* busy streets
* long lineups at tourist attractions
* places of worship

Stay at hotels that have robust security measures, including metal detectors, guards and security cameras. Keep in mind, however, that even the most secure locations cannot be considered completely free of risk.

Be particularly vigilant during religious holidays and other public celebrations, as terrorists have used such occasions to mount attacks.

* Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places and identify ways to leave the area in case of emergency
* Monitor local media
* Follow the instructions of the local authorities

### Crime

#### Violent crime

Violent crime, such as armed robberies, occurs regularly. Be particularly cautious on the road from Banda Aceh to Medan, where armed robberies have occurred.

Foreigners travelling alone and those travelling at night are at particular risk.

Standards of police services differ considerably from those in Canada.

* Avoid showing signs of affluence
* Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* If you’re travelling by car, keep valuable belongings out of sight, windows closed and doors locked

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs throughout Indonesia, specifically in tourist areas, such as Bali and Lombok. Criminals sometimes force people to withdraw cash from ATMs.

Merchants don’t always honour pricing agreements. Use good judgment in engaging services of tourist guides, especially in places that tourists rarely visit.

### Kidnapping

There is a threat of kidnapping, particularly in the provinces of Indonesian Papua and Aceh province. Foreign travellers have been kidnapped and killed. Terrorist groups have also kidnapped tourists in East and West Kalimantan.

* Be extra vigilant if travelling in these areas
* Avoid travelling alone and after dusk
* Use varied routes and schedules when moving from one place to another

### Women's safety

Women travelling alone may face some forms of harassment and verbal abuse.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations take place from time to time. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation. Security forces may use tear gas and water cannons to disperse crowds and prevent vandalism.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Political and social tension

There are long-standing sectarian and social tensions throughout Indonesia, particularly in the provinces of:

* Central Sulawesi, in Palu, Poso and Tentena
* Maluku, especially in Ambon
* Indonesian Papua

Sectarian violence targeting civilians has occurred. The potential for violence remains, despite ongoing security operations efforts from local authorities. Be aware of your surroundings.

### Fraud

There is a very high rate of credit and debit card fraud in Indonesia, including online fraud.

 When using debit or credit cards:

* pay careful attention if other people are handling your cards
* use ATMs located in public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

#### Romance scams

If you’re travelling to Indonesia to meet someone you’ve only met online, keep it mind that you may be the victim of a scam. Be wary of unsolicited emails or requests for a wire transfer.

Don’t send money to someone you have never met in person.

### Spiked food and drinks

Even if the wrapping or container appears intact, snacks, beverages, gum and cigarettes may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

* Be wary of accepting these items from new acquaintances
* Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers

People have died after drinking methanol-adulterated alcohol. Counterfeits of well-known alcohol brands often contain dangerous amounts of methanol. Poisoning incidents have happened at hotels, bars, and shops in tourist areas like Bali, Lombok, the Gili Islands and Sumatra.

* Be cautious if you choose to drink alcohol
* Be wary of lesser-known or illegal brands
* Avoid buying alcohol from individuals
* Seek medical assistance if you begin to feel sick

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety vary greatly throughout the country. Driving conditions may be hazardous during the rainy season.

Road travel in Indonesia can be very challenging due to:

* reckless driving
* perilous road conditions
* inadequate lighting
* poor signage
* high traffic congestion

If you plan to rent a car, consider hiring a driver.

Avoid driving after dark outside of major cities or major roads as some drivers do not use lights.

You may face mob anger if you are involved in an accident that causes serious injury. In such cases, remain in your vehicle and wait for a police officer to arrive.

#### Motorcycles and scooters

Motorcycle and scooter accidents are the main cause of death and serious injury among foreigners visiting many parts of Indonesia, including Bali.

Rental motorcycles are also often targeted and stolen. In such cases, you may have to pay the replacement cost for a new motorcycle.

### Public transport

Public transport can be crowded and safety standards are poor. Many remote parts of Indonesia have poor transportation networks.

#### Buses

Crashes involving overcrowded buses are common. Large buses are generally available only on Java. Minibuses are available elsewhere.

If you choose to travel by bus,

* keep in mind that minibus drivers may try to overcharge foreigners
* keep your belongings secure due to pickpocketing

#### Taxis

The condition of taxis varies. Foreign travellers using taxis have been victims of armed robbery, either by the driver or other passengers.

* Pre-arrange transportation with a safe and reliable taxi company
* Only use a taxi company whose vehicles are equipped with a meter
* Never enter a cab if it already has one or more passengers
* Don’t hail taxis off the street and avoid using unmarked taxi services

Reliable taxis are available from Bluebird, Thunderbird and Express. Be careful of “lookalike” taxis from competitors.

#### Ferries

Ferry accidents are common and are often caused by poor safety practices or extreme weather conditions.

If you choose to travel by ferry:

* make sure the vessel you are boarding is carrying appropriate safety equipment and that life jackets are provided for all passengers and accessible at all times
* don’t board vessels that appear overloaded or unseaworthy
* verify the safety standards of ferries with your tour operator

### Piracy

Pirate attacks and armed robbery against ships occur in coastal waters around Indonesia, particularly in the Strait of Malacca between Riau province and Singapore, and the waters north of Sulawesi and Kalimantan. Mariners should take appropriate precautions. Report all incidents to local authorities.
