# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Ongoing hostilities in the Middle East

There is ongoing military activity in the region. Missiles, drones and other projectiles could strike targets in the region. The security situation could deteriorate significantly without notice.

Avoid the vicinity of military installations.

There could be disruptions to movement and transportation, including:

* border closures or restrictions
* flight cancellations
* airspace closures

You should:

* be prepared to shelter in place if instructed to by local authorities
* be vigilant and follow the instructions of local authorities at all times, including any orders to shelter in place
* sign up with the [Registration of Canadians Abroad](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/registration) service to receive important information about the crisis
* ensure that your travel documents and those of your family are up to date
* monitor local and international media to stay informed of the rapidly evolving situation

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism.

Despite heightened security measures and counter-terrorism operations led by Kuwaiti authorities, there is an ongoing threat of attacks at or near foreign military installations and places of worship, particularly mosques. Heightened security measures, such as increased police presence and checkpoints, are typically employed during significant religious events at Shia sites.

Targets could also include:

* government buildings
* schools
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime occurs sometimes, including:

* pickpocketing
* bag snatching
* ATM and credit card theft

Theft particularly occurs in crowded public areas such as:

* popular tourist areas, including lookouts
* buses, trains, bus and train stations, and airports
* hotel lobbies
* restaurants, including outdoor seating areas
* outdoor markets and shopping malls

During your trip:

* keep your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, in a secure place
* do not show signs of affluence or wear expensive jewellery
* do not carry large sums of cash or valuables unnecessarily
* be aware of your surroundings, especially in busy tourist areas
* be extra cautious when withdrawing cash from ATMs
* stay in accommodations with adequate security measures

#### Violent crime

Although rare, violent crime has occurred, namely:

* burglaries
* murders
* sexual and physical assaults
* vehicle break-ins

Be extra cautious in the Jleeb Al-Shuyoukh area due to the high crime rate. The area is densely populated and characterized by poorer economic conditions compared to other areas of Kuwait City, which can lead to violence and street crime.

During your stay:

* be aware of your surroundings at all times
* avoid walking alone out after dark
* avoid isolated areas
* pay attention to people walking behind you
* do not resist an attack

### Fraud

#### Cybercrime

Cybercrime, malware attacks and online extortion occur frequently in Kuwait.

Criminals can compromise public Wi-Fi networks to steal personal data or credit information.

Criminals can monitor social media and listen to your phone conversations.

* Avoid making purchases on unencrypted websites
* Be cautious when posting information or photos on social media
* Be particularly vigilant when contacting or meeting individuals known only over the Internet

#### Telephone scams

There has been a significant increase in foreigners and locals receiving calls from scammers claiming to be local authorities or financial institutions. Scams may be quite sophisticated, and the caller may try to collect personal information or request a fund transfer to resolve administrative or customs issues.

Do not send any money or personal information in this type of situation.

### Unexploded ordnance

Unexploded ordnance from the 1991 Gulf War poses hazards in the desert region near the border with Iraq.

* Be extremely vigilant in remote areas
* Stay on main and paved roads
* Only cross at official border crossings
* Pay attention to signs indicating the possible presence of unexploded ordnance

If you encounter unexploded ordnance:

* do not get close to or touch them
* move away immediately
* contact local authorities

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations are permitted and occur in Kuwait, but demonstrators must obtain prior authorization from local authorities. They may take place in response to local or regional developments. Demonstrations are only authorized at Al Irada Square in Kuwait City.

It is illegal for foreigners to take part in demonstrations. You could be arrested and face deportation for participating in demonstrations.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Border crossings

You must obtain a “green permit” from the border control department of the Ministry of Interior of Kuwait to be authorized access to the border area with Iraq.

The border between Kuwait and Iraq is heavily guarded and there are several checkpoints.

You should only use official border crossings to and from Kuwait. Kuwaiti officials consider other crossings illegal.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

2SLGBTQI+ persons are frequently discriminated against and harassed based on their actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression or sex characteristics.

2SLGBTQI+ persons have been verbally, physically and sexually abused, including by police officers.

If you are detained by local authorities due to your actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender identity or any other sexual characteristic, you should report it immediately to the Embassy of Canada to Kuwait, in Kuwait City.

Kuwaiti law criminalizes sexual acts and relationships between persons of the same sex. Convicted offenders could face up to 7 years of imprisonment.

In 2022, the Constitutional Court of Kuwait decriminalized the “imitation of the opposite sex.” However, 2SLGBTQI+ persons could be arrested or deported for violating public morals or the public interest.

2SLGBTQI+ persons should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Kuwait.

### Women’s safety

Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment, verbal abuse or physical assault.

Local authorities may not respond adequately to reports of sexual violence and harassment. The notion of sexual consent may differ substantially from the Canadian context.

If you are the victim of a sexual assault, you should report it immediately to the Embassy of Canada to Kuwait, in Kuwait City.

* Avoid walking alone, especially after dark
* Avoid dark alleys and isolated areas
* Always meet new acquaintances in a secure and familiar location

### Roads

#### Road conditions

Road conditions vary across Kuwait.

Roads can be dangerous due to:

* uneven surfaces
* a lack of infrastructure maintenance
* potholes

Pedestrians sometimes walk on the street due to the absence of sidewalks, and vehicles don't always stop at crosswalks.

Sandstorms and heavy rains may reduce visibility and cause accidents.

#### Driving habits

Road accidents are rising in Kuwait. Fatal accidents are common, especially due to:

* speeding
* drivers overtaking other cars on road shoulders
* cars circulating with no headlights after dark
* distractions such as cellphone use while driving
* racing against other drivers
* road rage

In the event of an accident, you should contact the police immediately and, if possible, move your vehicle on the road shoulder to avoid blocking traffic and getting a fine.

If you choose to drive in Kuwait:

* exercise caution
* always drive defensively
* do not engage with drivers showing signs of road rage
* always carry a cellphone and a charger

### Public transportation

Public transportation options are limited to buses and taxis, especially outside major cities.

#### Buses

Buses are often behind schedule and most services do not operate at night.

#### Taxis

Official and unofficial taxis operate in Kuwait, but it’s difficult to differentiate them. Drivers may not always use meters and usually only accept payment in cash. Vehicles are not always equipped with safety features like seatbelts.

* Only use officially marked taxis or trusted ride-share services
* Arrange your pickup with your hotel before arrival when travelling by air or use authorized cabs at the airport
* Never share a taxi with strangers
* Confirm the fare in advance
* Have small bills available for payment

### Piracy

Pirate attacks and armed robberies against ships occur in coastal waters. Travellers should take appropriate precautions.
