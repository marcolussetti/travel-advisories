## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Dress and behaviour

Kuwaiti customs, laws and regulations reflect the conservative interpretation of traditional and Islamic practices and beliefs adhered to by the Kuwaiti authorities.

To avoid offending local sensitivities:

* dress conservatively
* behave discreetly
* respect religious and social traditions

While tolerated, revealing clothing such as shorts, skirts or tight clothing may be considered inappropriate for both men and women. Western women are not required to cover their head in Kuwait.

Verbal insults and obscene gestures may be considered a criminal offence and, if found guilty, you could face deportation, fines and/or a prison sentence.

It is illegal for an unmarried couple to live together in the same house or stay in the same hotel room. You will be asked to provide a marriage certificate if you share a hotel room with a person of the opposite sex.

Avoid public displays of affection.

### Ramadan

In 2026, the lunar month of Ramadan is expected to begin on or around February 17.

In public, between sunrise and sunset, be discreet when:

* drinking
* eating
* smoking

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Kuwaiti law criminalizes sexual acts and relationships between persons of the same sex. Convicted offenders could face up to 7 years of imprisonment.

In 2022, the Constitutional Court of Kuwait decriminalized the “imitation of the opposite sex.” However, 2SLGBTQI+ persons could be arrested or deported for violating public morals or the public interest.

2SLGBTQI+ persons should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Kuwait.

### Driving

Authorities may detain suspects as well as witnesses to incidents for lengthy periods with severely limited, or no access to, legal counsel or consular officials. They may also confiscate the passport of an individual involved in legal proceedings, pending resolution of the case.

Local authorities have increased their use of cameras and radars to enforce traffic regulations. You could face a two-month jail sentence if you exceed the speed limit.

If you use a handheld electronic device like a cell phone while driving, you could face a three-month jail sentence and a fine.

Kuwait has a zero-tolerance policy for drinking and driving. Penalties include:

* heavy fines
* imprisonment
* deportation

You must carry an International Driving Permit.

### Illegal activities

#### Blasphemy and lèse-majesté

Kuwaiti law prohibits:

* criticizing or defaming the Amir, the royal family, Islam and its symbols
* jeopardizing national security

These prohibitions extend to your online activity, including what you post, share or like on social media.

#### Other illegal activities

It is also illegal to:

* engage in religious proselytism
* import and consume pork products
* import and possess pornographic material
* take photos of government buildings and military or industrial sites, particularly oil fields
* take photos of people without their permission

You could face fines and/or jail sentences.

Writing cheques without sufficient funds is considered a serious offense and may result in imprisonment and fines.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Kuwait.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of Kuwait, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

### Family law

Kuwait’s family law is applied by religious courts, which interpret the Islamic Shariah. It covers matters related to:

* marriage
* divorce
* child custody
* inheritance

You should seek legal advice in Canada and Kuwait to understand how Kuwait’s law may affect your family matters.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Kuwait.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Kuwait by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Kuwait to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.
