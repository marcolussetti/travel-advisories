# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Kuwaiti authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond the date of entry into Kuwait.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Travel documents with an X in the "sex" field

The Kuwaiti authorities will deny you entry if your passport shows an X in the “sex” field or if it includes an observation to that effect.

### Visas

Tourist visa: required  
 Business visa: required  
 Student visa: required

You can obtain a tourist visa upon arrival. If you need a business or student visa, you must get it at an embassy or consulate of Kuwait before arrival.

You should apply to obtain an electronic visa prior to arrival to avoid delays or complications upon entry.

If you’re applying for a residency visa, your passport must be valid for at least 2 years. Your employer in Kuwait should not keep your passport.

#### E-Visa

Canadians travelling with a regular passport can also get a tourist visa online. You must present a copy of this visa for verification on arrival.

You must be able to show:

* a return or onward ticket
* proof of accommodation

### Employment

If you intend to work in Kuwait, you must obtain a certified criminal record check for each individual or dependent family member over the age of 18 who will be residing in the country.

The certified criminal record checks must come from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and be authenticated to be used in Kuwait. The authentication process can’t be completed more than three months before your date of arrival in Kuwait.

### Regional travel

Canadians have been denied entry into Kuwait because their passports bore an Israeli visa or border stamp, or an Egyptian or Jordanian border stamp issued by an office bordering Israel, since such a stamp would indicate entry from Israel.

### Exit bans

Kuwaiti authorities may place an exit ban on certain individuals to prevent them from leaving the country.

An exit ban can relate to investigations into:

* an individual, their family or an employer
* criminal and civil matters, including commercial disputes
* employment without a valid work permit
* unpaid financial debts, such as traffic fines

An exit ban can be requested by people involved in any of these circumstances or after a judicial decision. You may not be aware that authorities have placed an exit ban on you until you try to leave the country.

Your passport may be seized until the case is fully investigated and settled.

If you face an exit ban, you should seek legal advice.
