# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### State of emergency

A state of emergency is in effect in the following provinces:

* El Oro
* Guayas
* Los Ríos
* Manabí

The state of emergency is in response to gang violence. While the state of emergency is in effect, security forces have the power to:

* enter private homes
* read private mail and phone records
* prohibit assembly

If you are in Ecuador:

* expect an increased police and military presence
* always carry your identification
* follow the instructions of local authorities

### State of internal armed conflict

Ecuador is in a state of “internal armed conflict.” There is an increased presence of security forces to contain gang violence across the country, including in Guayaquil and Quito.

If you are in Ecuador:

* expect an increased police and military presence, especially near prisons
* carry your ID at all times
* follow the instructions of local authorities

### Border areas

Border areas often see higher criminal activity and violence.

#### Colombia

Criminal groups are active in the border area with Colombia. Criminal activities include:

* drug trafficking
* extortion
* armed assault
* kidnapping

#### Peru

Work to clear landmines in certain areas near the border with Peru is still ongoing. See the Regional Risks, above, for specific locations.

Criminal activity has been reported near the border crossing at Huaquillas, where we advise against non-essential travel. If you do cross the border by land from Peru, do so during daylight hours and ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times.

### Crime

Crime rates are high in Ecuador.

Arrest and detention rates are low and contribute to high levels of criminality. Infiltration within the security forces by local gangs weakens law enforcement even further.

#### Violent crime

Violent crime is a significant concern throughout Ecuador. Drug trafficking, transnational organized crime and street gang activity is prevalent. Violent incidents include:

* murders
* armed robberies
* kidnappings
* extortion
* home invasions
* sexual assaults
* car-jacking

These crimes occur even during the day in tourist destinations. Tourists, including Canadians, have been assaulted:

* in downtown areas
* on hiking trails
* at beaches
* in public parks
* outside banks

While you're in Ecuador:

* be aware of your surroundings at all times
* ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* avoid travelling after dark, and in isolated or deserted areas
* avoid showing signs of affluence
* avoid carrying large amounts of cash
* be extra cautious when withdrawing cash from ATMs
* don’t resist if you’re threatened, hand over your cash and valuables immediately

Tourist police officers are present in major cities, including Quito, Guayaquil and Cuenca.

#### Organized crime

Criminal gang activity has increased in recent years, particularly in the coastal provinces of El Oro, Esmeraldas, Guayas, Los Ríos, Manabí and Santa Elena. Since late 2022, the use of explosives has increased, especially in coastal provinces. Targets have included small businesses, gas stations, government offices, and bridges.

Organized criminal groups and gangs commit crimes such as targeted killings, express kidnapping, and armed robberies. They generally use knives and guns, and occasionally explosives.

Although tourists are not usually targeted, you may find yourself in the wrong place at the wrong time and caught in the crossfire.

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing, bag snatching and car break-ins, occurs daily in major cities.

Thieves often work in teams to divert the victims and snatch their possessions. Groups of street children selling candies are sometimes engaged in this type of team operation.

Thefts commonly occur in:

* popular tourist areas
* public transportation, especially city and inter-city buses
* bus terminals and airports
* shopping malls
* hotel lobbies
* restaurants, including patios

To avoid becoming a victim:

* be aware of your surroundings at all times
* keep a low profile when walking in public areas
* avoid carrying large amounts of cash or valuable items
* avoid showing signs of affluence
* avoid hitchhiking
* be suspicious of recent acquaintances or strangers approaching you
* avoid accepting rides or invitations from strangers

### Kidnapping

The number of kidnappings, especially express kidnappings, has significantly increased since 2022. Kidnappers mainly target locals, but foreigners have also been targeted. Many victims have been rescued by the police. Some victims are released in exchange for ransom.

While you’re in Ecuador:

* choose accommodation with good security measures
* keep your doors and windows locked at all times
* check your car for suspicious markings after leaving it parked on the street
* if you're kidnapped, comply with the kidnappers’ demands and don’t resist

#### Express kidnappings

These kidnappings are often committed by organised gangs, sometimes in collaboration with taxi or rideshare drivers. Kidnappers may take their victims to an ATM and force them to make a cash withdrawal, or else hold their victims for a few days and force them to make online bank transfers before releasing them.

* Use only reputable taxi companies
* Avoid hailing taxis on the street
* Use the security features in rideshare apps
* If you’re threatened, don’t resist

### Bomb threats

Since 2022, there have been multiple bomb threats in various parts of Ecuador, including in Quito and Guayaquil. Most bomb threats have been false alarms.

Bomb threats and hoaxes can target any location. In Ecuador, they tend to target government buildings and courthouses. Small explosives have also been used in several ATM robberies.

If you are in an area targeted by a bomb threat, follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders.

### Fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud may occur. Be cautious when using debit or credit cards:

* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

### Extortion

Police officers sometimes try to extort drivers by threatening detention or confiscating identity documents.

If police threaten you with a fine:

* remain calm and courteous but firm
* show original documents but keep them in your possession
* try to cooperate by following the instructions of police to avoid escalation
* ask for a clear explanation of the offence and a written fine that can be paid at a police station
* don’t pay a bribe to anyone
* call 911 to report the incident to the National Police

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations occur frequently.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

Ecuadorian law prohibits political activities by foreigners. You may face detention if you take part in demonstrations or political activities.

### Women's safety

Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment or verbal abuse.

Incidents of attacks and sexual assault against foreign women, including rape and murder, have been reported throughout the country, particularly in tourist areas. Even women travelling in pairs have been targeted.

* Choose accommodation with good security measures
* Be suspicious of recent acquaintances or strangers approaching you
* Avoid hospitality exchange arrangements, such as couch-surfing
* Do not accept transportation offers from strangers

### Spiked food and drinks

Snacks, beverages, gum and cigarettes may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery. Incidents can occur in various locations, including buses, nightclubs and bars.

* Be wary of accepting these items from new acquaintances
* Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers

#### Scopolamine

Scopolamine is a drug that temporarily incapacitates unsuspecting victims, who become disoriented quickly and are vulnerable to crime.

Thieves may slip the drug into food and drinks, smear it on papers, or blow it into the face of the victim. They often work in teams, with an attractive woman or man who eases their victim into a false sense of security.

Incidents occur in nightclubs, bars and restaurants, on public transportation and in the streets. They occur most frequently in larger cities.

Use extreme caution when dealing with strangers offering pamphlets, requesting information, or selling street wares.

### Indigenous shamanic ceremonies

The consumption of ayahuasca is common during indigenous shamanic ceremonies in Ecuador. These ceremonies are not regulated. The safety of the facilities, services, operators, or shamans cannot be assessed. They often take place in remote areas without access to medical facilities, emergency services or telecommunications.

The consumption of ayahuasca has caused serious medical complications, including cognitive and physical impairment. Several tourists, including Canadians, have died while taking part in such ceremonies. Some have also been assaulted or injured.

### Water activities

Coastal waters can be dangerous. Riptides are common.

Rescue services may not be consistent with international standards. Most beaches don’t have lifeguards or warning flags.

* Only undertake scuba diving and other water activities with a well-established company
* Don’t swim alone, after hours or outside marked areas
* Consult residents and tour operators for information on possible hazards and safe swimming areas
* Monitor weather warnings
* Follow the instructions of local authorities

This advice applies to both mainland Ecuador and to the Galápagos Islands.

### Adventure tourism

Outdoor activities, such as snorkelling, diving, surfing, white water rafting, horseback riding, parasailing, hiking, trekking and other adventure activities, can be dangerous if unprepared. Trails are not always marked, and weather conditions can change rapidly, even in the dry season.

Avalanches pose a risk in Ecuador. They can be fatal, even with light snow accumulations. Tourists, including Canadians, have died in avalanches on Ecuadorian volcanoes.

If you intend to practice adventure tourism:

* never do so alone, and don’t part with your expedition companions
* consider hiring an experienced guide from a reputable company certified by the Ministry of Tourism
* obtain detailed information on your activity and on the environment in which you will be before setting out
* avoid venturing off marked trails
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to tackle the challenges of your activity
* carry an avalanche beacon, a mobile phone and a fully charged battery pack to generate your position in case of emergency
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary

If you require emergency assistance in a remote area, find an area with a signal and call 911 so that authorities can geolocate your phone and send help more quickly.

### Power outages

Power outages can affect the following services and businesses:

* public lighting and traffic lights
* telecommunications and security systems
* stores and food supply
* hotels and other accommodations
* banks and ATMs

Prolonged power outages could increase the risk of criminal activity, which could lead to opportunistic theft.

If you’re in Ecuador:

* make sure you always have a complete emergency kit on hand, including several flashlights
* always carry a cell phone, a charger, a portable charger, and a list of emergency numbers handy

### Roads

Road conditions and road safety vary throughout the country. Accidents causing fatalities are common.

#### Road conditions

Road conditions are generally in fair conditions in urban areas. However, they remain poorly maintained in rural areas.

Heavy rain and mudslides often close or wash out roads. Driving in Ecuador may be hazardous due to:

* unmarked speed bumps
* large pot holes
* poorly maintained vehicles
* traffic lights on major highways
* heavy traffic, especially on weekends and statutory holidays
* stray livestock in rural areas
* heavy fog in mountainous areas

#### Driving habits

Drivers don’t respect traffic laws. They may drive at excessive speed and be reckless. Drinking and driving is frequent.

If you drive in Ecuador:

* always drive defensively and maintain heightened awareness
* plan your trip ahead of time, especially if you plan to visit a rural area
* avoid road travelling alone and at night
* carry a cell phone and a charger
* always keep your gas tank fullkeep your car doors locked and the windows closed at all times
* do not leave valuables within reach or in plain sight and unattended

### Public transportation

#### Buses

Many buses are not safe. Some are poorly maintained and often overcrowded. They lack safety equipment. Drivers are reckless. They often make illegal stops to pick up passengers. Robberies and assault occur regularly, especially in the Guayaquil area.

Avoid using local or intercity public buses.

#### Taxis

Taxis are generally safe to take during the day. They are easily available in urban areas.

Ride-sharing apps are also popular in Ecuador. They are usually a safe option to move around.

Incidents of assault and express kidnapping have occurred at night.

* Use official taxis with orange plates only
* Avoid hailing taxis on the street
* Never share a taxi with strangers
* Make sure the driver doesn’t pick up other passengers along the way to your destination
* Note driver’s name and plate number
* Ask the driver to start the meter or negotiate the fare in advance
* Have small bills ready for payment

#### Ferries

Ferry accidents have occurred mostly due to severe weather conditions or poor safety measures.

Some boats are poorly maintained and overloaded.

If you decide to travel by ferry:

* use only a reliable company
* make sure appropriate safety equipment is available
* make sure you have access to a lifejacket at all times
* don't board a boat that appears overloaded or unseaworthy

### Piracy

Pirate attacks and armed robbery against ships occur.

Take appropriate precautions.
