# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

The authorities of a country or territory decide who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Ecuadorian authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond the date you expect to leave Ecuador.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Visas

Tourist visa: not required for stays up to 90 days per period of 12 months   
Business visa: not required   
Student visa: not required

### Entry stamp

Make sure your passport is stamped upon arrival. You may face significant problems if you fail to present an entry-stamped passport when departing Ecuador.

Many tourists, including Canadians, have not stopped to get their passports stamped when arriving by land from Peru. When they try to leave the country later on, for example by airplane out of Quito, they are often required to return to the Peruvian border to obtain an entry stamp at the place of entry.

### Ecuador entry restrictions

If you enter Ecuador from Colombia or Peru through land or river borders, you must present a criminal record check from your country of origin or residence. The original criminal record check and the Spanish translation must be apostilled and cover the past five years. Minors travelling with their family members are generally exempt.

If you cannot provide a criminal record check, the Ecuadorian Migration System will check to verify that you don’t have previous convictions.

### Stay extension

You may extend your stay for an additional 90-day period once. If you decide to do so while in Ecuador, you must obtain a visa from the immigration authorities before the expriation of the entry stamp.

If you overstay your authorized length of stay, you may be:

* fined
* denied entry for one year

Local authorities may also add your name to their immigration records, requiring you to request a visa at an Ecuadorian embassy or consulate before re-entering the country.

### Amazon region

Some Indigenous groups require permits to enter their territory. If you are planning on visiting the Amazon region, ensure that you have the required documentation prior to entering the area.

### Children and travel

To leave the country, children born in Ecuador to a Canadian parent must:

* be registered with the Ecuadorian Civil Registry
* obtain an Ecuadorian passport
* present valid Ecuadorian and Canadian passports

Minor dual citizens - under 18 - travelling alone with both passports must have a letter of consent from both parents. This letter should:

* authorize the travel and stipulate the destination and duration of the intended trip
* be legally certified and translated into Spanish
* be notarized at the Embassy of Ecuador or an Ecuadorian consulate in Canada

Canadian minors travelling alone as tourists with Canadian passports don’t need this authorization letter.
