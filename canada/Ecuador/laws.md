## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Transfer to a Canadian prison

Canada and Ecuador are signatories to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in Ecuador to request a transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both Canadian and Ecuadorian authorities.

This process can take a long time, and there is no guarantee that the transfer will be approved by either or both sides.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect lengthy jail sentences and heavy fines.

You may also be found guilty by association if they have criminal associates. For instance, drivers could be held responsible for passengers carrying drugs in their luggage.

* Pack your own luggage and monitor it closely at all times
* Never transport other people’s packages, bags or suitcases
* Avoid picking up hitchhikers

### Identification

Local authorities may request to see your ID at any time.

* Carry valid identification or a photocopy of it at all times
* Keep a photocopy of your passport in a safe place in case it’s lost or seized
* Keep a digital copy of your ID and travel documents

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Many legal protections are in place and same-sex marriage is legal in Ecuador. Attitudes toward same-sex couples may vary in different communities.

### Indigenous justice

The justice systems of Ecuador’s indigenous peoples and nations have full legal value. They generally operate independently from the Republic of Ecuador’s justice system of police, prosecutors, courts, and prisons. Communities may or may not allow lawyers to intervene in their justice systems.

Most cases are resolved through dialogue. In a minority of cases, the accused person may receive a corporal punishment.

If you are accused of an offence in an indigenous community, you should:

* ask to speak to community leaders or authorities
* request that the Embassy of Canada be advised as soon as possible

Be respectful and follow the guidelines of your host or tour guide when visiting an indigenous community. Ask about the rules and regulations before visiting or engaging with the community.

### Investments

Disputes related to property acquisition or other investments are costly and take time to resolve.

If you plan to buy property, or making other investments in Ecuador:

* seek legal advice in Canada and in Ecuador before making commitments
* choose your own lawyer
* avoid hiring a lawyer recommended by a seller

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Ecuador.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Ecuador, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Ecuador.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Ecuador, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Ecuadorian court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Ecuador to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Driving

You can drive up to 6 months with your valid Canadian driver’s licence.

There is a traffic restriction based on the last digit of the vehicle licence plate number in Quito. You may be heavily fined and your vehicle temporarily seized if you fail to respect the restricted part of the city on the weekday (Monday to Friday) corresponding to your plate number.

If you are involved in a road accident-causing injuries, you will be temporarily detained, regardless of culpability. Detention may last until responsibility for the accident has been assigned and all parties are satisfied.

You should carry an international driving permit.
