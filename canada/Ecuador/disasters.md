## Natural disasters and climate

### Heavy rainfall

Heavy rainfall across Ecuador’s Sierra and Amazon regions has triggered flooding, landslides, and significant damage to the national road network, especially in the provinces of Azuay, Napo, Sucumbíos, Zamora Chinchipe, Loja, and Chimborazo.

In several areas, landslides have completely blocked vehicle access, making travel to the Amazon difficult. The provinces of Napo and Zamora Chinchipe are among the most affected by the heavy rains, and the government declared a road emergency there for 60 and 45 days respectively, on July 4.

### Climate change

Climate change is affecting Ecuador. Extreme and unusual weather events are becoming more frequent and may affect your travel plans. Monitor local news for the latest information.

Ecuador is subject to various natural disasters such as:

* earthquakes
* forest fires
* torrential rains
* tsunamis
* volcanic eruptions

### Rainy season

The rainy season extends from December to May.

Seasonal flooding can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable due to mudslides and landslides. Bridges, buildings, and infrastructure may be damaged. Underpasses may fill quickly with water.

* Monitor local media for the latest updates, including those on road conditions
* Stay away from flooded areas
* Monitor weather reports
* Follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders

### El Niño

The complex weather phenomenon called El Niño happens at irregular intervals of 2 to 7 years. In Ecuador, El Niño generally generates heavy rainfalls for 6 to 9 months, occurring at the same time as the rainy season from October to May.

* Keep informed of regional weather forecasts before and during your travels, and plan accordingly.
* Ensure you have adequate insurance to cover the consequences of such events, including the disruption of travel plans.

### Earthquakes and tsunamis

Ecuador is in an active seismic area. Earthquakes and tremors occur regularly.

Even minor earthquakes can cause significant damage.

Tsunami warnings may be issued after a strong earthquake. A tsunami can occur within minutes of a nearby earthquake. However, the risk of tsunami can remain for several hours following the first tremor.

If you’re staying on the coast, familiarize yourself with the region’s evacuation plans in the event of a tsunami warning.

### Volcanoes

Ecuadorian authorities are closely monitoring multiple volcanoes which are active:

* Chiles-Cerro Negro
* Cotopaxi
* Fernandina
* Guagua Pichincha
* Reventador
* Sangay
* Sierra Negra
* Tungurahua

Access to the Cotopaxi National Park could be restricted at any time without notice.

There are several volcanoes on the mainland and on the Galápagos Islands, including around Quito and the tourist communities of Baños and Riobamba.

Eruptions could occur at any time.  They sometimes lead to evacuations of surrounding areas on short notice. Volcanic ash fall may also disrupt domestic and international flights and cause the closure of major highways.

Exposure to falling ash and toxic fumes from active volcanoes can affect your health.

 If you are planning to travel near active volcanoes:

* consult a physician in advance to determine associated health risks if you suffer from respiratory ailments
* familiarize yourself with local emergency plans
* avoid restricted areas
* be prepared to modify your travel arrangements or even evacuate the area on short notice

In the event of a volcanic eruption:

* pay careful attention to all warnings issued for national parks
* monitor local media to stay informed of the evolving situation
* follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders

### Wildfires

Wildfires are common between June and September.

The air quality in areas near active fires may deteriorate due to heavy smoke.

In case of a major fire:

* stay away from the affected area, particularly if you suffer from respiratory ailments
* follow the instructions of local emergency services personnel
* monitor local media for up-to-date information on the situation
