## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Transfer to a Canadian prison

No transfer of offender’s treaty exists between Canada and Bolivia. If you’re convicted of a serious crime, you must serve your jail sentence in Bolivia. You may also have to remain in the country for a parole period after your release.

Detention conditions may be below the standards of Canadian prisons.

### Drugs

Bolivian drug laws include a zero-tolerance policy. Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect lengthy prison sentences and heavy fines.

Travellers have fallen victim to scams in which illegal drugs are hidden inside objects or luggage that an acquaintance has asked them to bring to or take away from Bolivia. Dating websites are a source of such scams.

* Pack your own luggage
* Never transport luggage or packages on behalf of another person

#### Unlicensed bars

Unlicensed bars in Bolivia are illegal. They are known to sell drugs. Police may detain and question you if they raid the establishment, even if you’re not consuming any illegal substances.

Avoid unlicensed bars.

### Exports

It’s illegal to export any item that the Bolivian government considers a national treasure (Patrimonio cultural) without formal written permission from the Ministry of Culture, including:

* pre-Columbian artifacts
* historical paintings
* items of Spanish colonial architecture and history
* native textiles
* flora, fauna and fossils

Any type of excavation for fossils or collection of fossils without prior written authorization is illegal.

#### Coca leaves

It’s illegal to import coca leaves and related products into Canada.

### Identification

Police and immigration officials occasionally conduct identification checks. You may have to present your passport upon check-in at hotels and other commercial accommodation providers.

* Carry copies of your passport and Bolivian entry stamp pages of your passport
* Never leave your passport or any other identity document with anyone

### Photography

Locals may find the presence of photographers intrusive, particularly in remote areas.

* Be careful when travelling with cameras and communications devices
* Befort taking someone’s photo, ask for permission

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Bolivian law does not prohibit sexual acts between individuals of the same sex.

Homosexuality is increasingly socially accepted, but much of Bolivian society remains conservative. 2SLGBTQI+ persons could be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression or sex characteristics.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Bolivia.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Bolivia, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

#### Military service

Military service is compulsory in Bolivia. Males aged 18 or over who are dual citizens must undertake military service upon arrival in the country.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Bolivia.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Bolivia by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Bolivia to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Driving

You must carry an international driving permit to rent or drive a vehicle.

The legal blood alcohol limit is 0.00%. If the police suspect you of drinking and driving, they could confiscate your driver’s licence on the spot and apply heavy fines and jail sentences.

If you’re involved in a traffic accident, remain at the scene until local police arrive. Attempting to leave the scene violates Bolivian law.

### Money

The currency in Bolivia is the boliviano (BOB).

Credit and debit cards are not widely accepted outside urban centres. Carry small bank notes to facilitate daily transactions such as:

* street food
* taxis
* tips

It’s difficult to exchange Canadian dollars in Bolivia. Bring U.S. dollars if you need to exchange cash.
