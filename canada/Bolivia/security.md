# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### General elections

General elections are scheduled for August 17, 2025.

Certain electoral rules will be imposed and strictly enforced before, during, and after the election. Penalties for breaking these rules may be severe and include detention until the end of the election.

* Public demonstrations are banned from midnight on August 14 until 6 pm on August 17
* The sale and consumption of alcohol is prohibited from midnight on August 15 until noon on August 18
* Public gatherings; vehicle traffic, including public transportation; and domestic flights are suspended on August 17

While international flights will still operate on August 17, there will be a limited number of taxis authorized to drive to and from the airport.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations occur frequently, often with little or no notice. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation. Protesters may also use dynamite during protests. The police often respond with tear gas to disperse crowds.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Strikes

Strikes occur frequently and often take place nationwide. Roadblocks are frequently erected during strikes, which can complicate travel plans.

* Consult local media to be aware of strikes that may affect your stay or travel plans
* In the event of a transport strike, plan extra time to get to your destination

### Roadblocks

Roadblocks are common throughout the country. They can lead to significant disruptions to traffic and public transportation. Roadblocks can also restrict the flow of goods and services throughout the country. The following are particularly vulnerable to blockades:

* main roads leading to large cities
* main arteries in cities
* roads leading to airports

Before making your way to the airport, check with your airline to determine if there are delays or changes in flight schedules caused by roadblocks

If you plan to take a road trip:

* review your travel plans to determine if they will be affected by roadblocks
* take personal security measures
* monitor local media

Once a roadblock is in place, local authorities, officials, and vendors will not be able to enter or exit the city to provide supplies to stranded travellers. As a precaution, you should take extra:

* food
* water
* fuel
* medication
* warm clothing

Don’t cross roadblocks, even if they appear unattended. This may aggravate the situation and lead to physical harm. Instead, consider:

* taking an alternative safer route
* returning to your place of departure

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, is common in large cities, including La Paz and Santa Cruz. Thieves target tourist areas and public transport. Theft also occurs in unofficial taxis.

* Only use a reputable taxi company or a trusted ride-sharing app
* Avoid hailing taxis on the street

Criminals often operate in organized groups. They will distract victims while an accomplice steals from them. Strategies include:

* staging a fight
* starting a conversation or offering help
* blocking a sidewalk
* throwing an object or liquid on the victims, then offering to help clean up
* posing as a victim of crime
* posing as a law enforcement officer
* using a young child to lure a tourist to a separate location

To avoid becoming a victim of theft:

* ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* don’t travel alone, especially at night
* be cautious of strangers approaching you
* remain alert to your surroundings at all times
* avoid showing signs of affluence
* avoid carrying large sums of money
* keep cellphones, cameras and other electronic equipment out of sight

#### Violent and drug-related crime

Violent crime against tourists is uncommon but does occur. Foreigners have been victims of armed robberies and assaults at tourist destinations.

Violent crime, carjacking and civil unrest, mainly associated with drug trafficking, pose risks in:

* the Chapare region between Santa Cruz and Cochabamba
* the Yungas region, northeast of La Paz
* border areas with Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay and Peru

### Fraud

#### Fraudulent police officers

Criminals often pose as police officers and ask to examine the traveller’s belongings or ask the traveller to accompany them to a bogus police station, sometimes in collusion with a criminal posing as a taxi driver or as another traveller.

Under Bolivian law, there’s no obligation to go with an officer to a police station unless they have a formal written request from a judge with your name on it. Any search or seizure must occur at a genuine police station in the prosecutor's presence.

If you’re stopped while travelling by someone claiming to be a local authority, ask to see their official identification.

#### Credit card and ATM fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud occurs. When using debit or credit cards:

* pay careful attention when others are handling your cards
* use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

### Car theft

Vehicle and auto-parts theft, as well as theft from vehicles, are common throughout Bolivia.

* Keep valuables in the trunk, and only when necessary
* Park your car in a supervised lot
* Keep car windows and doors locked at all times

### Express kidnapping

There is a risk of express kidnappings. Criminals ask for small, immediate ransoms. They usually force their victims to withdraw funds from an ATM or to arrange for family or friends to pay the ransom. This ploy is often used by criminal taxi drivers, who pick up the victim and then stop to pick up associates. These kidnappings are committed by organized gangs and occur throughout the country.

* Use only reputable taxi companies or ride-sharing apps
* Avoid hailing taxis on the street
* If armed criminals threaten you, cooperate and don’t resist

### Women's safety

Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment or verbal abuse.

Incidents of sexual assault against women travellers have occurred, including on guided tours.

* Do not accept offers of transportation from strangers
* Keep your hotel doors and windows locked

### Spiked food and drinks

There are reports of criminals adding drugs into items that could put you at risk of sexual assault or robbery. Items include food and drinks.

Incidents are most likely to occur:

* in nightclubs
* in bars and restaurants
* on public transportation, including taxis on the street

While you’re in Bolivia:

* be wary of accepting these items from new acquaintances
* never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers
* ask for drinks coming from sealed bottles or cans instead of in plastic cups

### Adventure tourism

There are no official minimum safety standards for tour operators, and reputable tour operators are limited.

Only participate in tours with well-established companies for adventure tourist activities, including:

* Salar de Uyuni
* jungle expeditions
* boat trips
* mountain biking, including old Yungas Road (commonly known as “Death Road”)
* Potosi mine tours

Be vigilant when hiking or trekking as criminals have targeted these tourist areas:

* in the areas surrounding La Paz, such as the Muela del Diablo
* near Rurrenabaque
* the Bolivian Andes
* in the Yungas region
* on the Inca trail

If you intend to participate in adventure tourism activities:

* stay on marked trails and consider hiring an experienced guide from a reputable company
* obtain detailed information on your activity and on the environment in which you will be setting out
* buy travel insurance that covers  incidents related to this type of recreational activity
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to tackle the challenges of your activity
* ensure that you have proper equipment and bring sufficient water
* monitor weather conditions and other possible hazards;
* share your itinerary with a friend or family member if hiking alone
* know the symptoms of acute altitude sickness, dehydration and heatstroke, which can be fatal
* stay away from stray dogs, which can be aggressive and carry rabies.

### Spiritual cleansing ceremonies

Spiritual cleansing ceremonies involving hallucinogenic substances (ayahuasca, peyote, San Pedro, etc.) have led to serious illness, injury, physical and sexual assault and even the deaths of several tourists.

Ceremonies involve consuming substances that can cause medical complications and severely impair cognitive and physical abilities. They often take place in remote areas with no access to medical or mental health facilities or resources. Often, there is no access to communications with local authorities. Facilities generally lack basic first aid or emergency plans to help those suffering from physical or psychological illness during these ceremonies.

Spiritual cleansing ceremonies are not regulated and individuals offering them are not licensed. There is no way to assess the safety of any of the services or the operators.

Avoid participating in spiritual cleansing ceremonies using hallucinogenic substances.

### Road safety

Road safety is poor throughout the country. Accidents and fatalities are common.

#### Road conditions

Road conditions are poor throughout the country.

Although improved highways connect Cochabamba, La Paz, Santa Cruz and Sucre, many roads in Bolivia are unpaved. The old Yungas Road (commonly known as “Death Road”) is considered one of the world’s most dangerous roads.

Driving can also be dangerous due to:

* narrow, winding and mountainous roads
* lack of guardrails
* insufficient lighting
* lack of traffic signs
* poorly marked construction sites
* unpaved roads
* potholes
* torrential rain and landslides
* poorly maintained vehicles

Four-wheel-drive vehicles are necessary outside major cities, especially in mountainous areas and during the rainy season.

#### Driving habits

Drinking and driving is common.

Drivers do not always respect traffic laws. Drivers can be aggressive and reckless and often speed.

### Water activities

#### Swimming

Lifeguard services do not always meet Canadian standards.  Most lakes do not have warning flags to alert of unsafe conditions.

* Consult residents and tour operators for information on possible hazards and safe swimming areas
* Follow the instructions of local authorities

#### Boat tours

If you take a boat tour:

* make sure the boat you are boarding is carrying appropriate safety equipment, including life jackets accessible for all passengers at all times
* don’t board boats that appear overloaded or unsafe
* verify the safety standards of boats with your tour operator
* if you have any doubts about the safety of the equipment, do not use it.

### Public transportation

Crime is high in public transportation and at transportation hubs. Accidents are common due to:

* poor maintenance of vehicles
* lack of safety standards
* poor road conditions

#### Buses and coaches

Road accidents involving local/interurban buses are frequent, especially with overnight buses.

If you choose to travel by intercity bus, exercise caution in:

* La Paz bus terminals due to petty crime, including:

+ the main bus terminal on Peru Avenue in Zona Norte
+ the terminal near the La Paz cemetery, and the Minasa terminal in Zona Villa Fatima

* the Santa Cruz bus/train terminal, where violent crimes against foreigners have occurred
* Coronilla Hill, adjacent to the main bus terminal in Cochabamba, due to assaults

Accidents involving poorly maintained coaches have caused death and injuries among tourists.

Only use tour buses operated by well-known, reputable companies. If you have any doubt about the safety of a bus or its driver, use another company.

#### Taxis

Many taxis are poorly maintained and do not have functional seatbelts.

You can call registered radio taxi companies from a landline or from a hotel. Radio taxis are identifiable by the telephone number and name of the taxi company on the vehicle’s roof.

* Avoid hailing taxis on the street and taking motorcycle taxis
* Note the driver’s name on his or her photo identification card and license number
* Exercise caution when taking cabs to and from airports, especially in Santa Cruz and La Paz, where tourists have been the victims of robberies
* Decline transportation from people offering cheaper fares
* Never share a taxi with strangers
* Confirm the fare in advance , as taxis are not equipped with meters

#### Ridesharing services

Ride-sharing services are not available in many cities.

If you use a ride-sharing app:

* confirm the driver’s identity and license plate before getting in the car
* use the security features in rideshare apps

#### Trains

Train service is limited and irregular.

#### Ferries

You can cross Lake Titicaca by ferry.

If you choose to travel by ferry:

* make sure the ferry you are boarding is carrying appropriate safety equipment
* make sure that life jackets are provided for all passengers and accessible at all times
* avoid boarding ferries that appear overloaded
* verify the safety standards of ferries with your tour operator
