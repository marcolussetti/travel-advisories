# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Bolivian authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months from the date you arrive in Bolivia.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Registration

All foreign residents and tourists must complete the web-based registration process (SIGEMIG) prior to arriving in Bolivia. Registration must include lodging information for the entire stay.

If you have not completed the electronic registration prior to arriving in Bolivia, immigration agents at the port of entry will register you and give you further instructions. If you fail to comply, you will be subject to fines upon leaving the country.

### Extensions of tourist visa

Applications for tourist visa extensions must be submitted to the General Directorate of Migration before the end of the 30-day period.  A 30-day extension can be obtained twice, at no extra cost and to a maximum of 90 days during one calendar year.

If you overstay the 90-day period without proper authorization, you may be fined upon departure.

### Other entry and exit requirements

Customs officials may ask you to show them a return or onward ticket and proof of sufficient funds to cover your stay.

When arriving by land, ensure your passport is stamped upon exiting the country you’re leaving and upon entering Bolivia. If you fail to do so, you’ll be fined upon departure. Avoid travelling at night when border officials and police may not be present.

### Luggage screening

Bolivia employs strict luggage screening measures at its international airports. You must complete an online declaration form prior to luggage screening and show an electronic or printed version of the QR code to authorities. All luggage is routinely X-rayed upon arrival.

### Children and travel

Bolivia has strict requirements for the entry and exit of persons under the age of 18, including special documentation.

Parents of children travelling alone, with one parent or with another individual are strongly encouraged to contact the nearest Bolivian embassy or consulate before departure to ensure that the latest entry and exit requirements, which may change without notice, are met.
