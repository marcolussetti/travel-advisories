## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

### Transfer to a Canadian prison

Canada and Liechtenstein are signatories to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in Liechtenstein to request a transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both Canadian and Liechtenstein authorities.

This process can take a long time, and there is no guarantee that the transfer will be approved by either or both sides.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect prison sentences or heavy fines.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Liechtenstein.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Liechtenstein, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Liechtenstein.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Liechtenstein by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Liechtenstein to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.
