# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Crime

The crime rate is low. Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs.

* Ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Exercise caution on trains, especially on overnight trips, as there have been incidents of theft

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in Europe. Terrorists have carried out attacks in several European cities. Terrorist attacks could occur at any time.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places. Be particularly vigilant if attending:

* religious holidays
* sporting events
* other public celebrations

Terrorists have used such occasions to mount attacks.

### Mountain activities

Mountain activities, such as hiking, can be dangerous, especially if they are not well prepared.

Weather conditions can change rapidly, even in summer. In winter, heavy snowfall can make it difficult to reach some villages and ski centres. Roads may become impassable. There is also a risk of avalanches, some of which can be fatal, even with light snow accumulations.

If you intend to go hiking, mountaineering or skiing:

* never do so alone and do not part with your hiking companions
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* do not venture off marked trails or slopes
* ensure that you’re adequately equipped
* carry and avalanche beacon or a GPS that will generate your position in case of emergency
* stay informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary
* know the symptoms of acute altitude sickness, which can be fatal
* obtain detailed information on your activity and on the environment in which you will be doing it before setting out

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety are excellent.

Driving conditions may be hazardous during winter, particularly in mountainous areas, where roads can be winding and are not always plowed. Snow chains are recommended.

#### Priority to the right

The “priority to the right” system is in effect in Liechtenstein.

Drivers must give way to vehicles approaching from the right at intersections, even on secondary roads. This is often a surprise to foreign drivers and results in accidents.

Familiarize yourself with the “priority to the right” system.

### Public transportation

#### Buses and trains

Public transportation is safe and reliable. Bus lines and railways connect Vaduz with the neighbouring countries.

The authorities carry out random checks on public transportation. You may be fined if you do not have a validated ticket.

Make sure you validate your ticket before boarding and keep it until the end of your journey.

#### Taxis

Taxis are safe and widely available.

#### Air travel

There is no international airport. The closest one is located in Zurich, Switzerland.
