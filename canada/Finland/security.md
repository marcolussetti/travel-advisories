# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Crime

Finland consistently ranks as one of the safest countries on the world. Despite this, petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching occurs, particularly in urban centres.

* Ensure that personal belongings, including passports and other travel documents are secure at all times, especially on public transportation such as the metro and trams as well as in transportation hubs such as Helsinki’s railway station
* Be vigilant when visiting major tourist sites such as the Esplanade

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in Europe. Terrorists have carried out attacks in several European cities and further attacks are likely.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites      frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

The Government of Finland maintains a public alert system on terrorism. It communicates changes online and through local and social media.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations take place regularly. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Road safety

Roads are safe and well maintained in Finland.

Driving may be hazardous during winter. Drivers should be comfortable driving in darkness, as daylight hours are very short. Icy road conditions are common and may cause road closures, particularly in northern areas.

Wildlife road accidents are common.

Be particularly vigilant if driving at nighttime.

* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* don’t venture off marked trails
* ensure that you’re properly equipped
* ensure that you’re well informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
