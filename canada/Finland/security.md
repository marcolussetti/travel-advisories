## Safety and security

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and bag snatching, occurs. Thieves target tourists.

Theft occurs sometimes, particularly in crowded public areas such as:

* popular tourist areas, including lookouts
* buses, trains, bus and train stations, and airports
* hotel lobbies
* restaurants, including outdoor seating areas

In Helsinki, thieves are active at the main railway stations and in Esplanadi park.

During your trip:

* keep your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, in a secure place and out of sight
* do not carry large sums of cash or valuables unnecessarily
* avoid isolated areas
* be aware of your surroundings, especially in busy tourist areas

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in Europe. Terrorists have carried out attacks in several European cities and further attacks are likely.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including police stations
* schools, including universities
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners
* cultural venues

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places. Be particularly vigilant if attending sporting events and during religious holidays and other public celebrations, as terrorists have used such occasions to mount attacks.

The Government of Finland maintains a public alert system on terrorism and communicates threat level changes online and through local and social media. The current threat level for Finland is level 2 (“elevated”) on a scale of 4.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations take place regularly. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Roads

#### Road conditions

Driving may be hazardous in rural areas and during winter. Daylight hours are very short in the winter, you will need to drive in darkness for most of the day. Icy road conditions are common and may cause road closures, particularly in northern areas.

Driving can also be dangerous due to wildlife on the roads.

### Adventure and Arctic tourism

Outdoor activities, such as hiking and trekking, and other extreme sports can be dangerous.

Many areas of Finland, including the Arctic provinces, are remote and inaccessible. Emergency services may not be able to respond quickly in isolated areas.

If you intend to participate in adventure tourism activities:

* share your itinerary with a friend or family member if you’re alone
* obtain detailed information on your activity and the environment in which you will be setting out
* buy travel insurance that covers incidents related to this type of recreational activity
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to tackle the challenges of your activity
* ensure that you have proper equipment and bring sufficient water
* monitor weather conditions and other possible hazards
