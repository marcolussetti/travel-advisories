# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs frequently. It's most prevalent in larger cities and may increase during major public holidays, such as Tet (Lunar New Year).

Criminals work alone or in groups and may use various techniques to distract you and steal your belongings. They may try to grab your bag and other valuables while passing on a motorbike or slash your bag in crowded streets and markets.

Theft is frequent:

* in popular tourist areas
* in markets, shopping centres and commercial streets
* on public transportation including sleeper trains
* in transportation hubs such as airports and train stations
* in restaurants, including patios and outdoor cafés
* at beaches and seaside destinations

While travelling:

* ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* keep a digital copy of your identity and travel documents
* avoid showing signs of affluence or wearing expensive jewellery
* avoid carrying large sums of cash
* avoid isolated areas, especially at night
* pay attention to your surroundings, particularly in crowded and tourist areas
* be extra cautious when withdrawing cash from ATMs

#### Violent crime

Although violent crimes targeting foreigners are rarer, they may occur. In some cases, criminals have used weapons such as knives and razors. Threats of physical injury related to personal disputes also occasionally occur.

* If you are involved in a dispute, contact the police as soon as possible
* If you are threatened by robbers, don't resist

#### Residential break-ins

Residential break-ins occur, especially in large cities and may increase before and during the Tet holiday (Lunar New Year). Burglars may target houses or apartments rented or owned by tourists and foreigners.

* Stay in accommodations with adequate security measures
* Make sure you lock doors and windows at night and when you're away

### Women's safety

Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse. Sexual assault and harassment do occur, including:

* in beach destinations
* in bars, nightclubs and entertainment districts
* on taxis and public transportation

Local authorities may not always respond adequately to reports of sexual violence and harassment. If you are a victim of sexual assault:

* seek immediate medical assistance, whether or not you appear to have been physically harmed
* contact the local police and ensure they file a report
* inform consular officials at the nearest Canadian embassy or consulate

### Fraud

#### Credit card and ATM fraud

Credit and debit card as well as ATM fraud occurs frequently.

* Avoid using your credit card in small establishments
* Consider using a card with a small credit limit
* Cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* Pay careful attention when others are handling your cards
* Avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* Use ATMs located in public areas or inside a bank or business
* Check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

#### Cybercrime

Cybercrime occurs. Perpetrators may compromise public Wi-Fi networks to steal credit card or personal information.

* Avoid using unsecured public Wi-Fi networks
* Avoid making purchases on unencrypted websites
* Be cautious when posting information on social media
* Be especially vigilant if you decide to meet someone you met online
* Don't click a suspicious link in an email or text message asking for your credit card details

#### At the airport

Criminals posing as taxi drivers have targeted foreign visitors at Nội Bài International Airport in Hanoi and robbed them by forcing them to withdraw money from ATMs.

Travellers have also been robbed by drivers who greeted them upon arrival with a placard showing their name.

* Arrange your pickup with your hotel before arrival, or use authorized airport taxis
* Confirm the driver's identity and the licence plate before getting in the car

#### Gambling scams

Tourists have been victims of gambling scams in Hanoi, as well as in Ho Chi Minh City, particularly in the Pham Ngu Lao neighbourhood.

The scam consists of a friendly invitation sent to the victim to go to someone's home in order to meet a relative interested in visiting Canada. While waiting for the relative, the scammers suggest a casual game of cards involving an initial small wager. Some victims have lost thousands of dollars over the course of an evening.

Be wary of unsolicited proposals from strangers.

If you've been scammed:

* get to a safe location immediately
* take note, as soon as possible, of the name and address of the facility where you were held
* notify the police and obtain a report
* if a bank card was involved, report the scam to your banking company, which will likely request a copy of the police report to cancel the transaction

### Demonstrations

### Current situation in Dak Lak

An increased police presence in Dak Lak continues, after organized attacks on a police station in June 2023.

If you are in the area, do not photograph security forces.

Public demonstrations are rare since local authorities don't usually authorize them. Demonstrating without authorization can lead to heavy consequences, including lengthy prison sentences.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Don't photograph demonstrations
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

You shouldn't expect internet privacy.

Local authorities may monitor your communications at any time. They may review the content stored or consulted on your electronic devices. They may also place certain foreigners under electronic surveillance. They can search your home or hotel room without your knowledge or consent.
