# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Vietnamese authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you use for travel.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid at least 6 months beyond the date you expect to leave Vietnam.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Visas

Tourist visa: required  
 Business visa: required  
 Student visa: required  
 Work visa: required

#### Visa verification

Make sure your application details match your passport exactly—this includes your full name, date of birth, and the order in which they appear.

Once your visa is issued, check it carefully to confirm that everything is accurate and exactly matches your passport information before you travel.

Errors or missing information can result in:

* additional fees
* denied boarding
* refused entry upon arrival

#### E-visa authorization

If you have a valid Canadian passport, you may be eligible to apply online for an e-visa. This can be a single-entry or multiple-entry electronic tourist visa, valid for a maximum of 90 days. It allows you to enter Vietnam via the port of entry indicated in the visa approval notice only. Some restrictions apply.

For visits longer than 90 days, you must get a visa from the nearest Vietnamese embassy before departure.

#### Visa exemptions

Canadian spouses or children of Vietnamese citizens may be eligible for a visa exemption certificate.

Contact the Embassy of Vietnam in Canada for more information on this process.

#### Visa extension

You must have a visa to enter Vietnam.

If required, you can request a visa extension at:

* the Vietnam Immigration Department in Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City
* certain local travel agencies and tour companies

Vietnamese visas in expired Canadian passports are not valid. The visa needs to be transferred to the new passport.

Overstaying your Vietnamese visa or having the wrong type of visa is a serious matter. You may be delayed from onward travel until a fine is paid.

Check the visa validity and conditions carefully.

### Registration

You must report your presence to local authorities upon arrival.

Commercial accommodations will generally file the declaration on your behalf. If you're staying in a non-commercial accommodation, you must do so with the nearest police station.

Make sure you request the return of your passport once it has been registered by hotel staff.

The hotel staff may ask to see your passport at check-in. They may make copies of it. They may also insist on holding your passport until you leave. There is no legal reason for this.

* Never leave your passport or any other ID document with anyone
* Ask for your documents to be returned to you as soon as check-in is complete

### Travel restrictions

Travel near military facilities is restricted:

* in some parts of the central highlands
* in some border area

If you wish to visit a village, commune or ward that is close to the border, you must obtain permission from the provincial police department.

Contact the relevant local authority to confirm these requirements.

### Health screening

Upon entry, you may be subject to a body temperature check.

### Exit bans

Vietnamese authorities may place an exit ban on certain individuals to prevent them from leaving the country.

An exit ban can relate to investigations into:

* an individual, their family or an employer
* criminal and civil matters, such as business disputes or motor vehicle accidents
* employment without a valid work permit
* unpaid financial debts

It is difficult to obtain information on bans from Vietnamese authorities. An exit ban can be requested by people involved in any of these circumstances. You may not be aware that authorities have placed an exit ban on you until you try to leave the country. Your passport may be seized until the case is fully investigated and settled.

If you're unable to leave the country because of an exit ban, consult a lawyer and contact the closest office of the Government of Canada.
