## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

Foreigners involved in legal proceedings are forbidden from leaving Taiwan until the dispute is settled.

Procedures can be lengthy and local authorities don’t accept bonds or deposits to guarantee court appearances.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs, including cannabis, are severe. Convicted offenders can expect heavy fines, jail sentences or the death penalty.

### Medication

Certain prescription and over-the-counter medications, legally available in Canada, are classified as controlled substances in Taiwan. It’s illegal to bring them into the country, even in small quantities, without prior permission.

If you attempt to bring banned medications into Taiwan without prior approval and required documentation, authorities may confiscate them. You may also be subject to heavy fines and jail sentences.

Consult local authorities to determine if you must obtain a permission to import required medication.

### Defamation

Public defamation laws are similar to those in Canada. However, they are strictly enforced. Be mindful of what you say and write publicly, especially on the internet.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Taiwan.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Taiwan, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### Mandatory military service

You may be subject to mandatory military service if:

* you are a man between 18 and 36 born in Taiwan

This requirement may apply even if you enter Taiwan on your Canadian passport.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Taiwan.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Taiwan by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Taiwan to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

English teachers are often recruited from abroad.

To work legally in Taiwan, you must have a work permit that specifically states you are permitted to accept employment.

Before accepting an offer:

* check the credibility of the prospective employer with the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office (TECO) in Canada
* ensure all terms and conditions of employment are clearly stated in the written contract
