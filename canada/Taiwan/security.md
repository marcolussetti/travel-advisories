## Safety and security

### Crime

The crime rate is low in Taiwan.

Violent crime is rare.

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs.

Ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times.

### Fraud

#### Credit card and ATM fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud occurs. Be cautious when using debit or credit cards:

* pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others
* use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

#### Telephone or email scams

Foreigners have received calls or emails from scammers claiming to be local authorities or financial institutions. The scammer may try to collect personal information or request a fund transfer to resolve alleged administrative or customs issues.

* Don’t send money to unknown individuals
* Don’t share personal information over the phone or via email

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety can vary greatly throughout Taiwan.

Driving conditions may be hazardous during the rainy season. Some roads can become impassable due to heavy rain and landslides.

Motorcycle and scooter drivers don’t respect traffic laws. They are extremely reckless.

* Avoid driving or riding motorcycles in Taiwan, even if you are an experienced motorcyclist
* Be particularly careful when walking or biking
* Always use elevated walkways or pedestrian bridges whenever possible
