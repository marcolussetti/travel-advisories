### Climate change

Climate change is affecting Taiwan. Extreme and unusual weather events are becoming more frequent and may affect your travel plans. Monitor local news to stay informed on the current situation.

### Typhoons and monsoon

The rainy (or monsoon) season extends from May to June. Seasonal flooding can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable and bridges damaged.

Typhoons usually occur between May and November. During this period, even small tropical storms can quickly develop into major typhoons.

These severe storms can put you at risk and hamper the provision of essential services.

If you decide to travel to Taiwan during this period:

* know that you may expose yourself to serious safety risks
* be prepared to change your travel plans on short notice, including cutting short or cancelling your trip
* stay informed of the latest regional weather forecasts
* carry emergency contact information for your airline or tour operator
* follow the advice and instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders

### Earthquakes and tsunamis

A tsunami can occur within minutes of a nearby earthquake. The risk of tsunami can remain for several hours following the first tremor. If you’re staying on the coast, familiarize yourself with the region’s evacuation plans in the event of a tsunami warning.
