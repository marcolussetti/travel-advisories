Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect long prison sentences and heavy fines.

Consumption of alcohol is authorized, but public displays of drunkenness could result in a two-year prison term.

### Illegal or restricted activities

Hunting is prohibited by law.

### Photography

Photography of military installations is prohibited.

Ask permission before photographing individuals.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Although the laws of Djibouti don’t prohibit sexual acts between individuals of the same sex, homosexuality is not socially tolerated.

2SLGBTQI+ persons could face arrest under other charges. Laws that prohibit attacks on “good morals” have been used to prosecute public displays of same-sex conduct.

2SLGBTQI+ travellers should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Djibouti.

In public, between sunrise and sunset, refrain from:

* drinking

* Exercise common sense and discretion in dress and behaviour
* Dress conservatively and respect religious and social traditions to avoid offending local sensitivities

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Djibouti.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Djibouti, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Djibouti.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Djibouti by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Djibouti to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.
