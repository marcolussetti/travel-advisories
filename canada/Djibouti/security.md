# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Djibouti–Eritrea border

The security situation along the border is unstable due to tensions between Djibouti and Eritrea.

### Border areas

The borders between Djibouti and Somalia and between Djibouti and Ethiopia are not always clearly identified. There could be unexploded landmines in these areas.

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism. Terrorist attacks could occur at any time.

Targets could include:

* military bases
* government buildings, including police stations
* schools, including universities
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners
* cultural venues

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

Be particularly vigilant during:

* sporting events
* religious holidays
* public celebrations
* major political event

Terrorists may use such occasions to mount attacks.

### Crime

Petty crime such as pickpocketing and purse snatching occurs. There are also incidents of theft from vehicles.

* Be vigilant in public places and avoid walking alone after dark
* Don’t show signs of affluence
* Ensure that your personal belongings, including passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Because of their isolation, avoid visiting the beaches in Doralé and Khor Ambado late in the afternoon

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations take place from time to time. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Road safety

Some streets are narrow, poorly maintained and lack adequate lighting. Local driving habits, pedestrians, roaming livestock and excessive speeds pose additional risks.

Major roads are paved, but often lack guardrails. Police may set up roadblocks of wire coils, which may be difficult to see at night. Railway crossings are not well indicated.

In the event of an accident, remain in the car and wait until the police arrive on the scene.

Don’t travel after dark.

Operational gas stations are located far from one another and are mostly found in:

* Djibouti
* Ali Sabieh
* Dikhil
* Obock
* Tadjourah

Ensure you have sufficient fuel reserves before undertaking long drives./p>

### Landmines

While Djibouti has been declared a “mine safe” country, you should stay on paved roads, particularly in the northern districts of Obock and Tadjourah, as well as Ali Sabieh in the south, where mines have been found.

### Identification

You should always carry photo identification, preferably a certified copy of your passport’s identification page.

### Public transportation

Intercity public travel is limited to bus and ferry services between Djibouti and the cities of Obock and Tadjourah. Buses are poorly maintained and driven erratically.

### Tourist facilities

Modern tourist facilities and communications networks are limited in the city of Djibouti and scarce in many outlying areas. Outside the capital, cell phone coverage is often unavailable.

### Piracy

Pirate attacks and armed robbery against ships occur in coastal waters and in some cases, further out at sea. Mariners should take appropriate precautions.
