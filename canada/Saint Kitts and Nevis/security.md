# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs. Violent crime, such as armed robbery and sexual assault, also occurs.

* Ensure that your personal belongings, including passports and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Avoid showing signs of affluence, such as flashy jewellery
* Carry only small amounts of money
* Be cautious when you are in crowded areas, especially during the holiday season or when attending festivals
* Avoid isolated areas and unpatrolled beaches after dark
* Keep car doors locked when driving

### Spiked food and drinks

Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

### Water activities

Coastal waters can be dangerous. Beaches are not usually supervised and don’t have warning flags. Rescue services may not be consistent with international standards.

If you are planning to take part in water sports:

* ensure that you are properly equipped
* never go far out to sea alone
* check with local authorities to find out which beaches are safe and patrolled

Be extra cautious if driving at night.
