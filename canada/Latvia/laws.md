## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Transfer to a Canadian prison

Canada and Latvia are signatories to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in Latvia to request a transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both Canadian and Latvia authorities.

This process can take a long time, and there is no guarantee that the transfer will be approved by either or both sides.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect prison sentences or heavy fines.

#### Alcohol

You can only drink alcohol in public in designated spaces. You face the risk of detention and a fine if you drink alcohol in public.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Latvia.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Latvia, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Latvia.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Latvia, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Latvian court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Latvia to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Drones

Latvian and European laws regulate recreational and commercial drone operation.

You must register as a drone operator and apply for authorisation with the Latvian authorities. Depending on the size of your drone and the intended use, you may also need to take a proof of competency exam.

Certain areas are restricted or off limits for personal drones. These include:

* military sites
* certain nature conservation areas
* areas within 5 km of airports

If you don’t comply with these laws, your drone could be confiscated and you could face heavy fines, arrest and detention. You could also be deported and banned from the entire Schengen area.

### Export of religious items and antiquities

Latvia enforces strict laws on the purchase and export of antiquities and objects of cultural heritage.

You should confirm with the Latvian authorities before exporting or leaving the country with such items.

### Driving

You can drive in Latvia with your valid Canadian driver’s licence for one year.

Penalties for drinking and driving are severe. The legal blood alcohol limit is 0.02% for drivers with less than two years of driving experience and 0.05% for others.

If a police officer suspects you of drinking and driving, they could confiscate your driver's licence on the spot. If you’re convicted, you can expect heavy fines or jail sentences.

If you are involved in an accident, do not move your vehicle until authorized to do so by the police.

All vehicles must have a first aid kit and emergency travel equipment.
