# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from Latvian authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Entry/Exit System (EES)

The Entry/Exit System (EES) begins operations on October 12, 2025.

The EES is an automated registration system for travellers from countries outside the European Union or the Schengen area. You will be required to register through this system upon arrival at the border of any of the 29 countries in the Schengen area.

You won’t need to take any action before you travel. The EES will collect information about your trip as well as your facial image and fingerprints.

### Schengen area

Latvia is in the Schengen area. Canadian citizens do not need a visa for travel to countries within the Schengen area. However, visa-free travel only applies to stays of up to 90 days in any 180-day period. Stays are cumulative and include visits to any Schengen area country.

If you plan to stay in the Schengen area for a longer period of time, you will need a visa. You must contact the high commission or embassy of the country or countries you are travelling to and obtain the appropriate visa(s) prior to travel.

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 3 months beyond the date you expect to leave the Schengen area.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Entry ban and restrictions on vehicles registered in Belarus or Russia

Latvia enforces an entry ban and restrictions on vehicles registered in Belarus or Russia. These restrictions are currently in place at the border and within Latvia and reflect European Union sanctions against Belarus and Russia.

Vehicles registered in Russia carrying Russian license plates will be refused entry into Latvia.

Restrictions on vehicles with Russian license plates are also in place in countries bordering Latvia. Check with local authorities before you try to leave Latvia in a vehicle with Russian license plates.

Certain exceptions apply. You should verify with the Latvian authorities before you attempt to cross the border in a private vehicle from Belarus or Russia.

### Health insurance

If you do not have proof of insurance coverage, you may be required to obtain health insurance from a Latvian insurance company when you arrive.
