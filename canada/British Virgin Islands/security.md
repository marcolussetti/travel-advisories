### Crime

The crime rate is low. Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs.

* Ensure that your belongings, including passports and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Don’t walk alone to deserted, unpatrolled beaches or poorly lit areas after dark
* Consult local authorities to find out which beaches are safe
* Don’t bring valuable to the beach

### Water activities

Coastal waters can be dangerous. Follow the instructions and warnings of local authorities.

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety are generally good throughout the islands. Mountain roads may be steep and narrow.

Road signage is limited. Roaming livestock pose further hazards, especially at night.

Drivers are reckless, particularly at night. Roadside assistance is not widely available. If you plan to drive across the islands:

* rent a four-wheel drive vehicle
* carry a cellphone

### Public transportation

Public transportation is available, but service is unreliable.

#### Buses

Bus services are available from the ferry dock to the most popular tourist areas on Tortola and Virgin Gorda islands. However, there is no official schedule or route. There is no government-managed public transportation

#### Taxis

Taxi service is reliable, but can be expensive. Prices are often based on the distance and the number of passengers.

Agree on a fare with the driver before departure to avoid being overcharged.

#### Ferries

Ferry services within the larger islands are available and frequent.
