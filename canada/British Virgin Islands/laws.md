## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

The British Virgin Islands are an overseas territory of the United Kingdom. However, it is a separate legal jurisdiction and has its own laws.

Canada and the United Kingdom are signatories to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in the United Kingdom to request a transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both Canadian and British authorities. This process can take a long time and there is no guarantee that the transfer will be approved by either or both sides.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs, including cannabis, are severe. Convicted offenders can expect jail sentences or heavy fines.

The islands are sometimes used as a drug-trafficking hub between South and North America.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and the British Virgin Islands.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in the British Virgin Islands by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in the British Virgin Islands to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Fishing permits

You must obtain a fishing licence for commercial, sport and pleasure fishing.

It’s prohibited to fish in a marine park and forbidden to capture or remove any marine animal or coral.

If you plan a fishing trip with a chartered vessel, make sure the company or captain already has a permit.

If you are staying less than 30 days, you can use your Canadian driver’s licence. Otherwise, you must obtain a local temporary driving permit to drive in the British Virgin Islands.

You can obtain a permit at any car rental agency or from the Traffic Licensing Office. To do so, you will need to present a valid Canadian driver’s licence or an international driving permit.
