## Safety and security

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime like pickpocketing and purse snatching occurs. Thieves work alone or in groups and may use various techniques to distract you and steal your belongings.

Thieves are especially active in crowded areas, such as:

* airports, train stations and public transportation hubs
* hotel lobbies
* concerts and music festivals
* restaurants, patios and outdoor cafés
* tourist attractions

Always keep your belongings in a safe place, including your passport and other travel documents.

#### Violent crime

Gang and organized crime-related violence occurs mainly in the three largest cities in Sweden:

* Stockholm
* Gothenburg
* Malmö

Stockholm County has experienced an increase in gun violence and homicides linked to gang rivalries. Recent incidents suggest retaliatory killings. In certain situations, criminals have used bombs, hand grenades or improvised explosive devices. Violent incidents have occurred in public areas, including bars and restaurants.

While violent incidents have not typically occurred in areas frequented by tourists, there is a risk of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

* Always be vigilant and aware of your surroundings
* Do not touch or move suspicious items or unattended packages

### Heightened threat of terrorism

There is a heightened threat of terrorism in Sweden.

Terrorist attacks could occur at any time.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places. Be particularly vigilant if attending:

* sporting events
* religious holidays
* major political events, such as demonstrations
* other public celebrations

Terrorists have used such occasions to mount attacks.

The Government of Sweden maintains a public alert system on terrorism. On August 17, 2023, the Swedish Security Service (SAPO) raised the national terrorist threat level from 3 (elevated) to 4 (high) on a 5-step scale. The threat level is based on the assessment that the threat posed by violent extremists will remain heightened. The Government communicates threat level changes online and through local media.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations occur from time to time. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Adventure and arctic tourism

Adventure tourism may lead to serious safety concerns if not well-organized. Weather conditions can change rapidly, even in summer.

In winter, heavy snowfall can make it difficult to reach certain areas. Roads may become impassable. There is also a risk of avalanches, some of which can be fatal.

If you undertake adventure tourism or trekking, especially in the arctic provinces and remote areas of Sweden:

* never do so alone
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* don’t venture off marked trails
* ensure that you’re properly equipped
* ensure that you’re well informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary
* obtain detailed information on each activity before setting out

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety are excellent. Some roads may be closed in winter, particularly in northern areas.

Wildlife road accidents are common. Be particularly vigilant if driving at nighttime. Road signs indicating risks posed by the presence of particular animals display the animal’s silhouette on an orange triangle with red borders.

### Public transportation

Public transportation services are efficient and reliable.

#### Trains and buses

Sweden has an extensive high-speed railway network that connects main cities and rural areas. Stockholm also has a metro (subway) rail service, and a regional commuter rail network serves the Southern part of the country.

Most cities have good public bus systems. Long-distance bus lines are also available.

#### Taxis

Taxis are widely available but may be expensive. Use only officially marked taxis and don’t share them with strangers.

Taxi fares in Sweden are not regulated. Fares may vary and have no upper limit. Always confirm the rates before your journey or pre-negotiate fares.

#### Ferry

There are daily ferry connections with Denmark, Germany, Finland and the Baltic countries.
