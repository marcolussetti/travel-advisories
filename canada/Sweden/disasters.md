### Wildfires

Forest fires may occur in summer months, and fire bans during the summer are common. Respect all fire bans to avoid a heavy fine. Whether or not a fire ban is in place, you may face arrest if you cause a forest fire.

If you plan on camping or cooking outdoors in Sweden during the summer:

* use a camping stove instead of an open fire
* follow the instructions of local authorities
