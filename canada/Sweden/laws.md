## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Transfer to a Canadian prison

Canada and Sweden are signatories to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in Sweden to request a transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both Canadian and Sweden authorities.

This process can take a long time, and there is no guarantee that the transfer will be approved by either or both sides.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect jail sentences or heavy fines.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Sweden.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Sweden, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Sweden.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Sweden, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Swedish court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Sweden to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Physical punishment of children

Physical punishment of children, including the threat of physical punishment, is illegal in Sweden. The law applies to all adults regardless of relation and in all settings, including at home. Swedish authorities can take custody of children and prosecute adults in situations where physical punishment occurs.

### Use of public land

Movement and camping on public land in Sweden is permitted under the “Allemansrätten” or “Freedom to Roam” law. Camping is not permitted within 70m of a dwelling or cultivated land. There are certain restrictions for specific areas, times of year, and uses.

### Driving

A Canadian driver’s licence can be used to drive in Sweden for up to one year. You should also carry an international driving permit.

#### Congestion charges

A congestion tax is imposed for vehicles entering and exiting Stockholm and Gothenburg. Consult the website of the Swedish Transport Agency to confirm the current hours and amounts for congestion taxes.

#### Equipment

Vehicles must be equipped with winter tires from December 1 to March 31. Winter tires may also be required outside of these dates when the Swedish police consider local weather conditions to be similar to the winter season. This could reflect snow, ice, or frost on the roads.

Children below 135 cm must sit in an approved car seat designed for their height and weight, either a baby car seat, child car seat, booster seat or booster cushion.

### Money

The currency of Sweden is the Swedish krona (SEK).

Many shops and restaurants no longer accept cash.

If you are carrying €10,000 or more, or the equivalent in other currencies or monetary instruments, you must make a declaration to customs when you enter or leave the European Union.

This does not apply if you are travelling within the European Union or in transit to a non-EU country.
