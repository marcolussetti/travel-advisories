### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and South Sudan.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in South Sudan by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in South Sudan to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Money

The currency of Sudan is the Sudanese pound (SDG). It is non-convertible outside the country and its export is prohibited.

Transferring U.S. dollars to Sudan is difficult because of international sanctions. In addition, U.S. currency dated prior to 2006 is not usually accepted.

Foreign banking and credit cards are not accepted in Sudan. There are ATMs, but they only service local accounts.

International flights and hotel bills must be paid in cash.

You should carry sufficient funds in U.S. dollars to cover your expenses for the duration of your stay.
