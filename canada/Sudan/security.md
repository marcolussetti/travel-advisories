## Safety and security

### Ongoing hostilities throughout Sudan

Since April 2023, there has been heavy fighting throughout the country, including in the capital, Khartoum, between the Sudanese army, a paramilitary group, and other affiliated armed groups. The security situation remains highly volatile and clashes are likely to continue in the near future. The civilian population has been the victim of violence, including sexual violence. Foreigners and employees of international organizations have also been targeted by these attacks.

Recent drone attacks in Port Sudan underscore growing insecurity in the area. The situation could deteriorate further.

You should leave the country now if you can do so safely.

The conflict has severely disrupted essential services, including medical care, banking services, electricity and telecommunications. Access to basic necessities such as food, water, medication and fuel is extremely challenging. The hostilities led to mass displacements within the country and the region, resulting in a dire humanitarian situation.

Khartoum’s international airport is closed. Port Sudan New International Airport is the only civilian airport operating international flights, but it is subject to drone attacks and may close without notice. If commercial departure options, including flights, become available from Port Sudan, you should carefully assess the security situation before you travel there. All overland travel remains extremely hazardous due to ongoing fighting.

If you are currently in Sudan and choose to stay despite this advisory:

* keep in mind that you are responsible for your own safety and that of your family
* use your judgment to decide the best time and the safest means to move to a safer location if you think it's required
* shelter in a safe place if you are not travelling to leave the country
* ensure that you have essential supplies, including food, water and fuel
* keep your doors and windows locked at all times
* keep your phone charged at all times
* ensure that your passport and other travel documents are up-to-date and secure at all times
* register or update your personal information through the [Registration of Canadians Abroad](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/registration) service and encourage other Canadian citizens in Sudan to do so
* monitor the local and international media to stay informed on the evolving situation

### Political situation

The political situation in Sudan remains very unstable following the coup d’État in 2021. Since April 2023, a violent armed conflict has been taking place between the Sudanese army, a paramilitary group and other affiliated armed groups throughout the country.

If you are in Sudan:

* limit your movements
* be extremely careful
* maintain low profile
* avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings
* monitor local and international media to stay informed on the evolving situation
* follow the advice of local authorities

### Demonstrations

Prior to the current conflict, large-scale demonstrations took place to demand the establishment of a democratically elected government. Security forces have used excessive and lethal force to disperse crowds, which has resulted in numerous casualties. Security forces have arrested an important number of activists and protestors. There continue to be reports of arbitrary arrests and detention in Khartoum and across the country, regardless of the presence of demonstrations.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Darfur

The conflict in Darfur has created a dangerous situation in western Sudan, particularly outside the major towns. Other areas of Sudan and eastern Chad are also affected by the conflict.

Despite the signing of a preliminary peace agreement, the security situation in Darfur remains extremely volatile, and lawlessness is prevalent.

Violence has resulted in deaths, displacement of people, general instability and insecurity.

The region has seen sporadic fighting between the government and rebels groups. Carjacking, break-ins and kidnapping remain a genuine threat to foreigners.

Violence regularly breaks out within camps for internally displaced people. Humanitarian workers and United Nations (U.N.) peacekeepers have been attacked and kidnapped.

Further clashes and regional violence cannot be ruled out.

A state of emergency is in effect in the 5 states of Darfur, Kassala, and South, West and North Kordofan. Curfews are sometimes put in effect by the government.

You should leave if you are in Darfur.

### Abyei region, West Kordofan, South Kordofan and Blue Nile

Both Sudan and South Sudan claim Abyei, and there is continued fighting in South Kordofan and Blue Nile between government forces and rebels.

There is a heightened risk of attacks in the region. Armed groups have carried out attacks on foreign workers, including oil field workers.

Sudan has declared a state of emergency in the states bordering South Sudan.

You should leave if you are in Abyei administrative region, South Kordofan or Blue Nile states.

### Border with Eritrea in Red Sea and Kassala states, and with Ethiopia in Al-Qadrif and Sennar states

The security situation in the area comprised within 50 km of the border with Eritrea, in Red Sea, and Kassala states, and within 50 km of the border with Ethiopia in the Al-Qadrif and Sennar states is volatile due to cross-border militant activity. Military operations have been occurring in the Tigray region of Ethiopia since early November 2020.

Foreigners working for aid organizations in this area have been the target of attacks.

### Border with Egypt

The Halayib triangle and Bir Tawil are disputed territories between Sudan and Egypt. The threat of isolated and indiscriminate clashes cannot be discounted.

### Northern State

There have been reports of a mobilisation and movement of security forces in Northern State, in particular Merowe and the surrounding areas, in April 2023.

### Border with Libya

The area within 50 km of the border with Libya is used by armed groups as transit route to smuggle weapons, goods and people and is prone to banditry.

### Border crossings

The land borders with some neighbouring countries are closed. Border closures may occur without notice.

Commercial overland expeditions occasionally cross Sudan’s land borders with Libya, the Central African Republic and Chad, but these routes are dangerous.

There are landmines in many areas outside the main cities, including border areas.

Don’t attempt to cross land borders.

### Crime

While the incidence of crime in Khartoum is low, incidents of petty crime are increasing including opportunistic theft from vehicles. Keep valuables out of sight and drive with locked doors and closed windows.

Banditry is rampant throughout western Sudan, especially in the Darfur region. Several incidents have resulted in deaths near the border with Chad.

#### Random searches

For national security reasons, Sudanese authorities may conduct random searches of personal effects belonging to individuals working for international organizations.

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism. Terrorist attacks could occur at any time.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* sites frequented by foreigners such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres markets, hotels, etc.

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

### Kidnapping

Westerners face the risk of being kidnapped even in Khartoum.

Maintain a heightened level of vigilance and consider regularly modifying your patterns of travel.

### Piracy

Pirate attacks and armed robbery against ships occur in coastal waters. Mariners should take appropriate precautions.

### Fuel shortages

There are shortages of fuel in Khartoum and most other areas of Sudan.

If you must travel by road, make sure you have enough fuel for the entire trip.

### Road safety

Unpredictable local driving habits, pedestrians and roaming animals pose serious risks.

Road conditions are poor.

Many roads outside the capital are sand tracks. A four-wheel-drive vehicle is required for overland travel except on the Khartoum–Kassala–Port Sudan, Khartoum–Atbara, and Khartoum–El Obeid highways.

Only experienced and fully equipped travellers should undertake desert travel. Basic equipment should include:

* a shovel
* metal ramps for heavy sand
* a global positioning system (GPS)
* spare fuel and
* water supplies

Roadblocks are common. Have your identity and vehicle documents readily available.

### Public transportation

Public transportation is limited outside of major urban areas.

#### Buses

Most buses are irregularly scheduled. They are poorly maintained and drivers are reckless. Fatal accidents involving buses are routine.

If you decide to travel by bus, use only top-of-the-line buses.

#### Ferry

A ferry connects Wadi Halfa, in Sudan, and Aswan, in Egypt.

#### Trains

A weekly train service operates between Wadi Halfa and Khartoum.

Trains are dilapidated, but service is punctual.

#### Taxis

Taxis are available in urban centres but are generally in bad conditions.

In Khartoum, you may use an online hailing service but you must have a local SIM card in your phone with the data service.
