# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Sudanese authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you use for travel.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond the date you expect to leave Sudan.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Visas

Tourist visa: required  
Business visa: required  
Student visa: required  
Transit visa: required

Allow at least 2 months between your visa application and the intended date of travel. Visas are not granted automatically to prospective travellers.

### Registration

As a foreigner, you must register with the Ministry of the Interior’s Aliens’ Registration Office within 3 days of your arrival in Sudan.

If arriving by land or sea, you can register at your port of entry.

Certain larger hotels offer to register their guests. Processing fees apply and vary depending on where you register. Two passport-style photos may be required.

### Travels outside of Khartoum

You must obtain a permit before travelling outside of Khartoum. You can obtain your permit from the Foreign Ministry. You should start procedures at least a week prior to your trip dates.

It is extremely difficult to obtain permits for destinations within west Sudan, except for persons working for registered humanitarian organizations and diplomatic missions.

Sudanese authorities enforce permit regulations rigorously and they can retain documents. Carry at least 3 copies of your travel permit and passport, including the Sudan visa page, at all times.

### Stamp from Israel

Local authorities will automatically deny you entry to Sudan if your passport contains a stamp from Israel.

### Children and travel

The country’s customs, laws and regulations adhere closely to Islamic practices and beliefs.

Under Sudanese law, women and their children may encounter difficulties relating to mobility. Local authorities may prohibited them from departing Sudan if the father has not given his consent, regardless of custodial rights accorded to the mother by any Sudanese, Canadian or other courts.
