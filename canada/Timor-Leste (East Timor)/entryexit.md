# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

The authorities of a country or territory decide who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the authorities of Timor-Leste. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond the date you expect to leave Timor-Leste. It must contain at least one blank page for the placement of a visa.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with a “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

You should also be aware that current systems used by some countries and travel companies may not recognize the “X” gender identifier. You may still be asked to provide your sex/gender information as either male or female when travelling.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Tourist visas

#### Entering by air or by sea

You can obtain a tourist visa on arrival at Dili’s international airport and the Port of Dili. You must pay an entry fee for a visit of up to 30 days. You can apply to extend your visa, for a fee, past the 30-day limit at the Immigration Service in Dili.

#### Entering by land

If you plan to enter by land, you need to apply in advance for a Visa Application Authorization online, or in person at an Embassy or Consulate of Timor-Leste.

Once at the border, you must present the document. If you meet all of the requirements and pay the fee, you can obtain a single or multiple-entry visa valid for a stay up to 90 days.

There are no currency exchange facilities at Dili’s international airport or at border crossings. Carry the exact amount for the entry fee in cash.

#### Work or business visas
