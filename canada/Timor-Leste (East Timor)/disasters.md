### Earthquakes and tsunamis

Timor-Leste is located in an active seismic zone. Earthquakes occur frequently and there is a risk of tsunamis.

* Familiarize yourself with earthquake security measures in hotels and public and private buildings
* In the event of an earthquake, pay careful attention to local authorities’ official warnings

A tsunami can occur within minutes of a nearby earthquake. However, the risk of tsunami can remain for several hours following the first tremor. If you’re staying on the coast, familiarize yourself with the region’s evacuation plans in the event of a tsunami warning.
