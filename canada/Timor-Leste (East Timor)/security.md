# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Political situation

The political situation is tense.

Violent episodes could occur with little notice, especially during significant political events, such as presidential or parliamentary elections. Be vigilant in the periods leading up to, during and following these types of events.

Military operations may take place at any time throughout the country. If you encounter a military operation:

* leave the area immediately if you can do so safely
* follow the instructions of local authorities
* remain vigilant at all times

### Crime

#### Violent crime

Gang-related violence, arson, robbery and vandalism occur, especially in Dili.

Gangs in Dili have attacked cars with stones and darts fired from slingshots, particularly during the early evening hours and at night.

Violence between martial arts groups occurs, despite the government banning most of their activities.

* Avoid armed non-government groups, including martial arts groups, throughout the country
* Exercise extreme caution at bars and nightclubs, where altercations between groups may take place

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs. Thieves frequently target foreigners.

* Do not show signs of affluence
* Be aware of your surroundings
* Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations take place from time to time. They are likely to occur:

* near government buildings, institutions or residences
* around Dili’s Presidente Nicolau Lobato International Airport

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Tourist facilities

Tourist facilities and services such as hotels, restaurants and public transportation are very limited on the island, except in Dili.

Government services are also limited.

### Trekking

Locals regularly find unexploded ordnance in open areas outside Dili.

If you intend on trekking:

* never do so alone and always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* ensure that you’re properly equipped and well informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary, including when you expect to be back to camp
* know the symptoms of acute altitude sickness, which can be fatal
* obtain detailed information on trekking routes before setting out and do not venture off marked trails

### Water activities

Crocodile attacks occur across the country.

There have been crocodile sightings on beaches in Dili and other popular destinations. They are often present on the south coast.

Check with locals for the latest on the situation.

#### Swimming

Tidal changes can cause powerful currents and riptides are common.

Rescue services may not be consistent with international standards.

* Consult locals and tour operators for information on possible hazards and safe swimming areas
* Wear reef shoes to protect yourself against coral cuts and stonefish
* Follow the instructions and warnings of local authorities

#### Diving

Tour operators may not adhere to international standards.

If you undertake adventure sports, such as diving:

* choose a well-established and reputable company that has insurance
* ensure that your travel insurance covers the recreational activities you choose

If in doubt concerning the safety of the facilities or equipment, don’t use them.

### Road safety

Aside from main roads in Dili, road conditions and road safety are poor throughout the country. Roads are poorly maintained and lack adequate lighting. Those outside of Dili are often unpaved.

Roads in mountain areas can also be narrow and winding. Driving conditions can be hazardous during the rainy season due to flash floods.

Serious accidents are frequent. Roadblocks are common.

* Avoid travelling at night
* Avoid travelling alone or in isolated areas
* Avoid driving or riding motorcycles, even if you are an experienced motorcyclist

### Public transportation

Public transportation is unsafe. Assaults have occurred, including in taxis.

Avoid unnecessary local travel.

#### Buses

Buses are generally overcrowded and don’t meet international safety standards.

#### Taxis

If you decide to travel by taxi, keep in mind that yellow taxis aren’t metered, so you should agree on a fare before departure.

#### Ferries

Ferry accidents are common and often caused by poor safety practices or extreme weather conditions.

If you choose to travel by ferry:

* make sure the vessel you are boarding is carrying appropriate safety equipment
* make sure that life jackets are provided for all passengers and accessible at all times
* don’t board vessels that appear overloaded or unseaworthy
* verify the safety standards of ferries with your tour operator

### Piracy

Pirate attacks and armed robbery against ships occurs in coastal waters and, in some cases, farther out at sea.

Mariners should take appropriate precautions.
