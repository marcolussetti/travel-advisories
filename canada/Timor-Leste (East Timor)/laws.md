### Political activities

Foreigners cannot interfere or participate in political activities.

If you engage in such activities, you may be subject to fines, detention and deportation.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Timor-Leste.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Timor-Leste, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Timor-Leste.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Timor-Leste by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Timor-Leste to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Money

The currency in Timor-Leste is the U.S. dollar (USD).

The economy is primarily cash based. Many places will not accept bills issued prior to 2007.

Credit cards are not widely accepted. There are ATMs in Dili; however, they can charge high fees to dispense cash and are often out of order.
