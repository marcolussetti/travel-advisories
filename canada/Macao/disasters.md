### Typhoons and monsoon

The rainy (or monsoon) season extends from May to October. Typhoons usually occur between April and October.

During this period, even small storm can quickly develop into typhoons. These severe storms can put you at risk and hamper the provision of essential services.

Severe rainstorms have occasionally caused flooding and landslides, resulting in loss of life and damage to infrastructure.

The Macao observatory issues alerts before a significant storm or other meteorological risk.

If you decide to travel to Macao during the rainy season:

* know that you may expose yourself to safety risks
* be prepared to change your travel plans on short notice, including cutting short or cancelling your trip
* stay informed of the latest regional weather forecasts
* carry emergency contact information for your airline or tour operator
* follow the advice and instructions of local authorities
