## Safety and security

### Crime

Petty crime such as pickpocketing and purse snatching occurs, particularly:

* at the airport
* on public transportation
* in casinos
* in main shopping areas and markets
* in hotel lobbies
* on crowded streets
* at tourist attractions

While in Macao:

* be vigilant in crowded locations
* don’t carry large sums of money

### Fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud occurs. When using debit or credit cards:

* use ATMs located inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations are illegal without prior approval from the local government.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

If you participate in or are witness to a demonstration, you may be subject to scrutiny and severe legal action.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Don’t film or take pictures of demonstrations
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Cyber security

You shouldn’t expect internet privacy. Your communications may be monitored at any time, and authorities may review the content stored or consulted on your electronic devices.

Authorities will be on the lookout for material appearing to be seditious or that is critical of mainland China and local authorities

### Journalism and research

Journalists and other media workers in Macao are facing certain restrictions in the context of their work.

You should be particularly vigilant if researching or reporting on subjects critical of or sensitive to the government. You may face censorship.

### Road safety

Roads are narrow and winding. Traffic is usually congested.

### Public transportation

Public transportation is safe and reliable but may be limited outside tourist areas. Certain casinos and leisure establishments operate shuttles.

#### Taxis

Taxis are widely available. Certain ride-sharing apps are illegal in Macao.

Most taxi drivers don’t speak English or French. If you don’t speak Chinese, you should arrange for a person to write out your destination in Chinese characters before you go.

* Use only officially marked taxis
* Negotiate fares in advance, or insist that the driver use the meter, as you may be overcharged
