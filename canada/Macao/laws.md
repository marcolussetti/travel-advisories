## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### National security law

The National security law for Macao came into effect in 2009. Activities considered as national security violations are broadly and vaguely defined. They could include activities that are not considered illegal in Canada and that occurred outside of Macao.

In May 2023, local authorities' power to enforce laws outside of Macao was expanded but the details of its implementation remain vague.

You risk being arbitrarily detained on national security grounds, even while you are transiting through Macao. You could be subject to transfer to mainland China for prosecution. Penalties are severe and include long prison sentences.

### Bans and sanctions

The Chinese government may ban or sanction entities or individuals for actions, including oral or written statements, and associations with entities that are critical of:

* the Communist Party of China
* the Chinese government
* Chinese leaders and policies

The Government of the People’s Republic of China does not publicize a list of banned or sanctioned entities or individuals, and the implementation of bans or sanctions remains vague. The effect on individuals associated with banned or sanctioned entities is unknown.

It could include:

* a ban on travel to mainland China, Hong Kong and Macao
* freezing of assets
* prohibition of business or association with Chinese citizens and organizations

If you believe you may be subject of a ban or sanctions, consult a lawyer and contact the closest office of the Government of Canada.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect jail sentences and heavy fines.

### Photography

Photography of military installations, government buildings may be restricted. Seek permission from local authorities before taking photographs.

Taking photographs in the gambling areas of the casinos is prohibited.

### Dual citizenship

The Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China applies in the Macao Special Administrative Region (MSAR). Under this law, dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Macao.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of China, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

If you are a Canadian dual citizen born in Macao or with current or previous Macao residency, you need to complete a declaration of nationality in order to be treated as a Canadian citizen. Consult the Macao Department of Identification regarding this process.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Macao.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Macao, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Macao court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Macao to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

You should carry an international driving permit. If you are a resident of Macao, you can exchange your Canadian licence for a local one under certain conditions.

### Money

The currency is the Macao pataca (MOP). Hong Kong dollars are also accepted.

Upon entering or leaving Macao, you must make a declaration to customs if you travel with more than MOP 120,000 or the equivalent in other currencies. The sum can be in cash, cheques, money orders, traveller’s cheques or any other convertible assets.
