## Safety and security

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime such as pickpocketing and purse snatching occurs. Tourists are frequently targeted.

Organized groups of thieves often use distraction techniques and are particularly active:

* at tourist sites and attractions
* in hotels, restaurants and bars
* on public transportation
* at airports and railway stations

While you’re in Ireland:

* ensure that your belongings, including your passport, are secure at all times
* don’t keep your passport and other types of ID in the same place and carry a photocopy rather than the original when you are out
* avoid showing signs of affluence or wearing expensive jewellery
* avoid carrying large sums of cash or unnecessary valuables
* avoid deserted streets at night
* pay attention to your surroundings, particularly in crowded and tourist areas and when withdrawing cash from ATM

#### Vehicles

Car theft and break-ins occur, particularly in tourist areas in Dublin and surrounding areas. Rental vehicles are a target of choice.

* Familiarize yourself with your route before starting the trip
* Keep your windows and doors locked at all times
* Keep your belongings out of reach
* Use secure parking facilities, especially overnight
* Never leave belongings unattended in a vehicle, even in the trunk

#### Violent crime

Violent crime, although rare, may occur in larger cities.

If you are the victim of a crime, you must report the incident to the nearest An Garda Síochána station, Ireland’s National Police Service. The Garda can then refer you to the Irish Tourist Assistance Service (ITAS) for further assistance.

You may file a preliminary complaint online for theft of belongings. This could help speed up the process at the police station.

The ITAS offers support and assistance to tourists who become victims of crime while in Ireland. The service can:

* arrange accommodation, transportation and meals
* liaise with many companies, such as travel insurance and financial institutions
* liaise with the local police and the Embassy of Canada

### Fraud

#### Credit card and ATM fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud occurs. When using debit or credit cards:

* pay careful attention if other people are handling your cards
* use ATMs located in public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements
* never save your debit or credit card’s details in unknown laptops or computer devices

#### Cybercrime

Cybercrime occurs. Perpetrators may compromise public Wi-Fi networks to steal credit card or personal information.

* Avoid using unsecured public Wi-Fi networks
* Avoid making purchases on unencrypted websites
* Be cautious when posting information on social media
* Be particularly vigilant when contacting or meeting individuals known over the internet
* Never click a suspicious link in an email or text message asking for your credit card details

#### Romance scams

If you’re travelling to Ireland to meet someone you’ve otherwise only met online, you may be the victim of a scam. Be wary of attempts at fraud by persons who profess friendship or romantic interest over the internet.

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in Europe. Terrorists have carried out attacks in several European cities. Terrorist attacks could occur at any time.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places. Be particularly vigilant if attending sporting events and during religious holidays and other public celebrations, as terrorists have used such occasions to mount attacks.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations and strikes occur regularly. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

Violent demonstrations occurred in Dublin in November 2023 and led to acts of vandalism, arson, and clashes between demonstrators and police.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Adventure tourism

Outdoor activities, such as hiking and biking, may lead to safety concerns if they are not well-organized. Trails are not always marked and weather conditions can change rapidly, even in summer.

If you intend to go walking, biking or hiking in remote areas:

* never do so alone and do not part with your hiking companions
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* do not venture off marked trails
* ensure that you’re adequately equipped
* stay informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary
* obtain detailed information on your activity and on the environment in which you will be doing it before setting out

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety are generally good. Some roads can be uneven, narrow and winding, particularly in rural areas. These may become hazardous during severe weather conditions.

Roundabouts are common.

* Use caution when entering a traffic circle
* Reduce speed on narrow, uneven country roads

### Public transportation

#### Taxis

Taxis are generally safe.

Negotiate fares in advance or insist that the driver use the meter as rates can vary based on the time of day and location.

#### Buses and trains

Intercity bus and train services networks are extensive and reliable.

They are occasionally affected by overcrowding and traffic congestion.

Strike actions may also cause disruptions.

#### Cycling

Cycling is a common transportation option in Ireland, particularly in Dublin. If you do cycle, pay attention to traffic regulations and vehicles.
