Saint Lucia regularly experiences water shortages. Local authorities may impose water rationing measures.

If you are in Saint Lucia:

Coastal waters can be dangerous as riptides are common. Beaches are unsupervised and don’t have warning flags to warn of unsafe conditions.   

* Never swim alone
* Always maintain a safe distance from boats and restricted areas
* Consult residents and tour operators for information on possible hazards and safe swimming areas
* Don’t dive in unfamiliar waters as hidden rocks or shallow water can cause serious injury or death

### Adventure tourism

Outdoor activities, such as zip lining, hiking, mountain biking, and other adventure activities can be dangerous if unprepared. Trails are not always marked, and weather conditions can change rapidly, even during summer.   

If you intend to practice adventure tourism: 

* never do so alone, and don’t part with your expedition companions
* obtain detailed information on your activity and on the environment in which you will be setting out
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* stay informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* refrain from using facilities or equipment if you have doubts on their safety
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary
