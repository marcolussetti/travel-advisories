## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

No transfer of offenders treaty exists between Canada and Saint Lucia. If you’re convicted of a serious crime, you must serve your jail sentence in Saint Lucia. You may also have to remain in the island for a parole period after your release.

### Drugs

There are severe penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs. If you are convicted, you can expect jail sentences and heavy fines.

* Pack your own luggage and monitor it closely at all times
* Never transport other people’s packages, bags or suitcases

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Saint Lucian law criminalizes sexual acts and relationships between persons of the same sex.

2SLGBTQI+ persons could be discriminated against or detained based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or sex characteristics. They could also be detained and face other charges such as:

* cross-dressing
* gross indecency
* offence to public morals

2SLGBTQI+ persons could face a lengthy jail sentence. They should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Saint Lucia.

### Investments

Disputes related to property acquisition or other investments are costly and take time to resolve.

If you plan on buying property, or making other investments in Saint Lucia:

* seek legal advice in Canada and in Saint Lucia before making commitments
* choose your own lawyer
* avoid hiring a lawyer recommended by a seller

### Death penalty

The authorities of Saint Lucia apply the death penalty for serious offences, though it is rarely enforced.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Saint Lucia.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Saint Lucia by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Saint Lucia to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.
