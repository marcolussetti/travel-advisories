# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs. Violent crime is rare.

Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times.

### Water activities

#### Swimming

Lifeguards don’t usually supervise beaches. Tidal changes can cause powerful currents in the many coastal lagoons that surround the islands. Riptides are common. Several drownings occur each year.

Rescue services may not be consistent with international standards.

* Consult residents and tour operators for information on possible hazards and safe swimming areas
* Wear reef shoes to protect yourself against coral cuts and stonefish
* Follow the instructions and warnings of local authorities

#### Diving

Tour operators may not adhere to international standards.

If you undertake adventure sports, such as diving:

* choose a well-established and reputable company that has insurance
* ensure that your travel insurance covers the recreational activities you choose

If in doubt concerning the safety of the installation or equipment, don’t use them.

### Stray animals

Stray dogs are common throughout the islands.

Don’t approach or feed them since they could be aggressive.

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety can vary greatly throughout the country.

Coastal roads on Rarotonga are paved but are poorly maintained and lit. Driving conditions may be hazardous during the rainy season.

Traffic accidents involving motorcycles are common.

* Avoid driving after dark
* Be particularly vigilant during the rainy season
* Be mindful of stray animals

### Public transportation

#### Buses

Buses are available on Rarotonga but service may be irregular.

#### Taxis

Taxis are generally safe. Some drivers may overcharge their clients.

* Use only officially marked taxis
* Negotiate fares in advance or insist that the driver use the meter

#### Ferries

There is a ferry service between certain islands.

Ferry accidents may occur due to the overloading and poor maintenance of some vessels.

Don’t board vessels that appear overloaded or unseaworthy.
