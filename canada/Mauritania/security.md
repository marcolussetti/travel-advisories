# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Northern and eastern Mauritania

Extremist groups and armed smugglers are active in Mauritania’s northern and eastern areas and there is a high risk of banditry and kidnapping. Armed rebels are active in the northern area beyond the Oualata–Tichit–Ouadane–Zouérat line. Attacks and thefts of personal belongings and vehicles have occurred.

### Military zone

The Defense Ministry of Mauritania has established a military zone in the north-east of the country where civilian access is forbidden. The military zone is located between Cheggat in the north-east, Ain Bentili in the north-west, Dhar Tichitt in the south-west and Lemreyye in the south-east. The Mauritanian Minister of Defense has publicly warned that any individual who enters the area will be treated as a military target.

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism. Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Western interests may be particularly targeted.

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

Stay at hotels that have robust security measures, however, keep in mind that even the most secure locations can’t be considered completely free of risk.

Mauritania’s borders in the Sahel region are porous, and terrorists operate in those border regions and the interior.

### Kidnapping

There is a high risk of kidnapping in Mauritania, and Westerners are a preferred target. Hostages have been detained for several months before being released. Be particularly cautious in areas bordering Western Sahara and Mali.

To lessen your risk of being kidnapped, travel with a reputable escort familiar with the country. Use varied and unpredictable routes and schedules when moving from one place to another. Exercise high personal security awareness at all times, and monitor local developments.

### Crime

Petty crimes such as pickpocketing, theft and residential break-ins occur.

Car theft and assaults also occur.

* Avoid unpatrolled beaches at all times because of the risk of banditry and carjacking
* Avoid the Cinquième (fifth) district in Nouakchott after dark
* Travel in groups
* Remain alert
* Ensure that your belongings, passports and other travel documents are secure at all times.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations occur from time to time, particularly on Fridays between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m, after the afternoon prayer. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place, particularly mosques, around prayers on Fridays
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Women’s safety

Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment, verbal abuse and physical assault. Women should travel in groups and avoid travelling alone at night.

Women have been detained when reporting sexual assault, as they must prove that the sex was not consensual to avoid being charged.

### Desert travel

If you must travel to remote desert areas, you will experience extreme climate and isolation.

* Travel in convoys
* Be accompanied by an experienced guide
* Remain on well-used tracks
* Carry sufficient supplies
* Seek the advice of local authorities before travelling
* Leave an itinerary with family or friends

### Border crossings

There are two main border areas in Mauritania: at the northeastern border with Western Sahara and the southwestern border with Senegal.

The border crossing into Moroccan-controlled Western Sahara leads into a buffer zone, and there is no paved or well-marked road between the two border controls. There are unexploded landmines in the 20-30 km-wide area between Mauritania and Western Sahara. Landmines can shift with the movement of sand and dunes.

The two main land border crossings into Senegal are located at Diama and Rosso. Pedestrians and vehicles cross over the dam at Diama and by ferry at Rosso. The road leading to Diama may be impassable during the rainy season. Long delays at the border are common. Ferry crossings at Rosso are available only between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. Don’t cross the Senegal River by pirogue (small boat) because it is illegal and dangerous.

### Public transportation

Public transportation is generally unsafe and unreliable.

### Road safety

Road conditions are generally fair to poor. There are four major roads in the country from Nouakchott:

* N1 toward Atar
* N2 along the coast toward the north (Nouadhibou, Western Sahara and Morocco)
* N3 toward Néma
* N4 along the coast toward the south (Rosso and Senegal)

Most other roads are unpaved sand tracks.

Drivers don’t respect traffic laws and regulations. Drifting sand and dunes may occasionally force vehicles off the roads. Roaming animals, bush taxis and poorly maintained vehicles frequently cause accidents. Roadside assistance is non-existent. Wear seatbelts at all times. Avoid driving at night.

Rent vehicles with drivers. In the event of an accident or vehicle breakdown, the driver and rental company will be held responsible. If the vehicle is rented without a driver, the person renting the vehicle will be held responsible.

In the event of an accident, a police report must be filed. Should an accident result in injury or death, drivers are detained until a judge determines responsibility.

Police conduct routine roadblocks in major cities such as Nouakchott. They may ask for proof of identity and a driver’s licence.
