### Dress and behaviour

Islamic practices and beliefs are closely adhered to in the country’s customs, laws and regulations. Dress conservatively, behave discreetly and respect religious and social traditions to avoid offending local sensitivities. It would be prudent for women to wear a headscarf and cover their arms and legs.

### Ramadan

In 2026, the lunar month of Ramadan is expected to begin on or around February 17.

In public, between sunrise and sunset, refrain from:

* drinking
* eating
* smoking

### Extramarital relations

Adultery, extra-marital sexual relations and prostitution are illegal. Offenders may face strict penalties, including imprisonment.

### Family law

Children of Mauritanian fathers automatically acquire Mauritanian citizenship at birth, regardless of where they were born.

The father’s permission is required for any child to travel, even if the child is travelling on a foreign passport.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Mauritania.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Mauritania by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Mauritania to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

There is no limit on the importation of foreign currency but it should be declared on arrival. The exportation of foreign currency is limited to the amount declared on arrival. Exchanges will only accept U.S. dollars and euros. Some hotels in Nouakchott and Nouadhibou accept credit cards.
