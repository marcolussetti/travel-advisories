### Photography

Photography of military personnel and installations is prohibited. Cultural and religious factors influence the interpretation of what subjects may be photographed. Ask permission before taking photographs.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Mali.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Mali, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Mali.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Mali by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Mali to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

The law of Mali doesn’t prohibit sexual acts between individuals of the same sex. However, homosexuality is not widely socially accepted. 2SLGBTQI+ persons could face other sanctions.

2SLGBTQI+ persons should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Mali.

### Exports

Mali restricts the export of certain Malian archaeological objects, particularly those from the Niger River Valley. Under Malian law, visitors seeking to export such items require an export authorization from the National Museum of Mali in Bamako.

### Dress and behaviour

Mali’s customs, laws and regulations closely adhere to Islamic practices. Dress conservatively, behave discreetly and respect Malian religious and social traditions to avoid offending local sensitivities.

### Ramadan

In 2025, the lunar month of Ramadan is expected to begin on or around February 28.

In public, between sunrise and sunset, be discreet when:

* drinking
* eating
* smoking

### Driving

You should carry an International Driving Permit.

### Money

The currency is the African Financial Community franc, or CFA franc (XOF). Credit cards are rarely accepted outside a few major hotels. The Central Bank of West African States has a foreign exchange bureau on Koulikoro Road in Bamako, close to the Grand Hôtel. Exchange facilities are often slow and offer rates that are out of date.

Access to ATMs is limited outside of Bamako.
