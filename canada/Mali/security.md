# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Political Situation

Since the coup d'état of August 2020, Mali has been ruled by a military-led transitional government. In September 2023, the authorities announced a postponement of presidential and legislative elections, with a return to constitutional order scheduled for early 2024. Since then, no election date has been set.

On December 31, 2023, the MINUSMA, which supported the peace process and helped stabilize the security situation in the country, withdrew from Mali. The security situation in the country could further deteriorate.

You should leave the country by commercial flights if it is safe to do so.

If you are in Mali:

* remain vigilant
* monitor local and international media to stay informed on the evolving situation
* follow the instructions of local authorities

### Terrorism

Terrorist groups operate in Northern and central Mali They regularly carry out attacks targeting mainly the Malian security forces.

Bamako and the southern and western parts of Mali are also exposed to terrorist threats. Since 2022, there has been an increase in terrorist attacks in central, western and southern Mali, including in the vicinity of Bamako. Although they have primarily targeted security forces installations, the attacks have resulted in numerous casualties, including civilians.

Active terrorist groups are determined to increase their attacks and kidnappings targeting foreigners.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including police stations
* schools, including universities
* places of worship
* security installations
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners
* cultural venues

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

Be particularly vigilant during:

* sporting events
* religious holidays
* public celebrations
* major political events, such as elections

Terrorists may use such occasions to mount attacks.

### Shortages

#### Fuel shortages

Since September 2025, terrorist groups have imposed a blockade on fuel imports to Mali, causing severe disruptions to the country's supply.

This has led to a reduction in essential services, long lines at gas stations and transportation difficulties.

* Always keep your gas tank at least half full
* Keep a supply of fuel on hand
* Carefully plan all road travel

#### Power outages

Power outages occur regularly across the country and can last more than 8 hours. Not all buildings have generators.

Power outages could impact essential services, such as:

* the public water supply
* telecommunications
* banking transactions

### State of emergency

A state of emergency is currently in effect throughout Mali. Heightened security measures are in place, including random identity checks and roadblocks. Carry identification and follow the instructions of local authorities at all times.

* Remain extremely vigilant
* follow political and social developments carefully

### Bamako

In the past, establishments in Bamako frequented by foreigners have been targeted by attacks, causing deaths and injuries. If you are in Bamako despite the advisory, avoid travelling in urban areas after dark, especially in places frequented by foreigners.

### Northern Mali

Military clashes with armed rebels persist in Northern Mali. Rebel forces, terrorist groups and criminal networks operate throughout this region and legitimate Malian security forces cannot ensure the safety of foreigners.

Insecurity in Northern Mali is exacerbated due to a lack of:

* infrastructure
* reliable transportation
* safe hotels
* emergency services

The ability of the Canadian embassy in Bamako to provide consular services in Northern Mali is severely limited.

### Border areas with Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea and Senegal

Terrorist and criminal incidents have occurred in border areas with Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea and Senegal. Clashes between Malian authorities and other armed groups have occurred in the Kayes and Sikasso regions.

### Kidnappings

The risk of kidnapping is high throughout Mali, especially in the northern regions and in all border areas. Attacks, with the intent to kidnap, now occur in areas surrounding Bamako. Westerners are specifically targeted. Some hostages have been detained for months before being released, and some have been killed. There is a heightened risk of terrorist attacks and kidnappings targeting Westerners in Bamako.

If you need to travel within Mali:

* use varied and unpredictable routes and schedules
* exercise particular caution when travelling on highways, in rural areas and residential areas, even during daylight hours
* avoid border areas
* exercise particular caution when travelling the access roads to the airport
* avoid travelling after dark

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations take place frequently, particularly at the Independence Monument, located in Commune III, and at the Bouguiba Monument, located in Commune IV in Bamako. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Crime

Crime is on the rise in Mali, particularly in Bamako, which has seen an increase in armed assaults and robberies. Westerners have been the targets of:

* carjacking, especially in the north
* car theft
* various scams

Roadblocks, which are often set up at night, can lead to travel disruptions and contribute to the heightened threat of crime. Avoid travelling after dark.

Carjackings occur throughout Mali, especially in the north. Petty crime occurs often.

Be careful of scammers at the Modibo Keïta International Airport.

* Travel in groups
* Remain vigilant
* keep your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, in a secure place
* Avoid poorly lit areas after dark

Corruption is prevalent. Police may stop drivers and request payments for unknown reasons.

When shopping, note that food products are sometimes sold past their expiry date and higher prices may be charged for merchandise bought in markets.

### Fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud occurs. Be cautious when using debit or credit cards:

* pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others
* use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

### Road safety

Exercise extreme caution when driving. Road conditions off major roads are poor. Driving standards, lack of traffic signals, excessive speed, pedestrians and livestock on roadways, traffic congestion, the absence of sidewalks and poorly lit streets all pose serious risks. Overloaded transport vehicles often break down and cause accidents. Many vehicles lack lights. Roadside assistance is not available. Avoid driving at night.

During the rainy season, some dirt roads may be impassable without a four-wheel-drive vehicle. Vehicles should be equipped with spare tires and an emergency kit. Keep informed of regional weather forecasts and plan accordingly.

### Public transportation

Public transportation is unreliable in the capital. Agree on taxi fares before departure.

We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.
