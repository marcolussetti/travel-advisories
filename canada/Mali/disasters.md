## Natural disasters and climate

There are 3 main seasons in Mali:

* the dry and cool season, from November to February
* the dry and hot season, from March to June, where temperatures can reach 45Â°C
* the rainy season, from June to October

During the rainy season, seasonal flooding can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable and bridges damaged.

Dust and sand storms are frequent.
