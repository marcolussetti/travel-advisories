### Poás Volcano

Costa Rican authorities are closely monitoring the active Poás Volcano. Although authorities have reduced the alert level to “orange” (level 3 on a scale of 4) for the surrounding area, Poás Volcano National Park remains closed.

An orange alert is also in effect for the nearby district of Toro Amarillo.

If you are near the Poás Volcano, you should monitor local media to stay informed of the evolving situation.

### Hurricane season

Hurricanes usually occur from mid-May to the end of November. During this period, even small tropical storms can quickly develop into major hurricanes.

These severe storms can put you at risk and hamper the provision of essential services. You could face serious safety risks during a hurricane. You should carefully consider these risks when planning a trip during hurricane season.

If you decide to travel to a coastal area during the hurricane season despite the risks:

* be prepared to change your travel plans on short notice, including cutting short or cancelling your trip
* stay informed of the latest regional weather forecasts
* carry emergency contact information for your airline or tour operator
* follow the advice and instructions of local authorities

### Flooding

The rainy season extends from May to November, which sometimes extends into January.

Torrential rains and landslides occur frequently in the lowlands and mountainous areas along the Caribbean and in the Central Valley.

Seasonal flooding often causes power outages.  It can also hamper overland travel and reduce the delivery of other essential services. Roads may become impassable and bridges damaged.

### Earthquakes and tsunamis

Costa Rica is located in an active seismic zone. Earthquakes and tremors occur regularly. Tsunamis are possible.

A tsunami can occur within minutes of a nearby earthquake. However, the risk of tsunami can remain for several hours following the first tremor. If you’re staying on the coast, familiarize yourself with the region’s evacuation plans in the event of a tsunami warning.

### Volcanoes

There are several active and potentially active volcanoes in the country, including:

* Arenal
* Poás
* Rincón de la Vieja
* Turrialba

Eruptions may occur at any time. They sometimes lead to evacuations of surrounding areas on short notice.

In the event of an earthquake or volcanic eruption:

* pay careful attention to all warnings issued for national parks
* monitor local media to stay informed of the evolving situation

* follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders
