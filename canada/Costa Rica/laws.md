## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Transfer to a Canadian prison

Canada and Costa Rica are signatories to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in Costa Rica to request a transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both Canadian and Costa Rican authorities.

This process can take a long time, and there is no guarantee that the transfer will be approved by either or both sides.

If you violate Costa Rica’s laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested or imprisoned.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect lengthy jail sentences or heavy fines.

### Child sex tourism

It's a serious criminal offence to have sex with minors in Costa Rica.

Conviction may result in a lengthy prison sentence.

### Identification

Authorities may request to see your ID at any time.

* Carry valid identification at all times
* Keep a photocopy of your passport and entry stamp in case it’s lost or seized
* Keep a digital copy of your ID and travel documents

### Photography

It is illegal to photograph official buildings.

Check with local authorities before taking photos.

### Investments

Disputes related to property acquisition or other investments are costly and take time to resolve.

If you plan on buying property, or making other investments in Costa Rica:

* seek legal advice in Canada and in Costa Rica before making commitments
* choose your own lawyer
* avoid hiring a lawyer recommended by a seller

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Costa Rica.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Costa Rica, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Costa Rica.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Costa Rica, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Costa Rican court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Costa Rica to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Driving

You can drive with your valid Canadian driver’s licence in Costa Rica for up to 180 days, or the length of the stay granted on your entry stamp.

You must also carry your passport when driving in the country. Photocopies are not acceptable. You may face a fine if you fail to provide proper documentation when stopped by a traffic officer.

If you are involved in a road accident, the Costa Rican government may prevent you from leaving the country until all injury claims have been settled, regardless of which party is at fault or has insurance coverage. The local legal process may take several months.

In the event of a car accident:

* don’t move your vehicle until the authorities arrive
* remain at the scene
* call 911 to report the accident

Automatic speed cameras are common. If you exceed the speed limit, you may receive a speeding ticket by mail.

Traffic fines don’t have to be paid on the spot. You can pay a fine:

* at COSEVI (Costa Rican Road Safety Council)
* at a bank

If a police officer asks you for money, you may make a complaint to the Costa Rican Tourism Bureau.

Credit cards are generally accepted.

It’s extremely difficult to exchange Canadian dollars in Costa Rica. U.S. dollars are more easily exchanged.

Cash withdrawals are possible with a 4-digit PIN only.
