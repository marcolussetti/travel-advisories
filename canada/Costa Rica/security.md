## Safety and security

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs frequently. Tourists are common targets for theft because they are perceived as being wealthy.

Crime against property, such as house burglary, theft from cars, and vehicle theft, is frequent. Passport theft is also extremely common and increases in frequency during the peak tourist seasons, from November to May and from July to August.

Thieves often work in teams, in which one thief diverts the victims’ attention while the other snatches their possessions. Thefts commonly occur:

* in popular tourist areas, including viewpoints
* on buses, on trains, in bus and train stations as well as in airports terminals
* in hotel lobbies
* at restaurants, including on patios located near streets

While you’re in Costa Rica:

* ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* carry your passport, including the Costa Rican entry stamp received at the immigration entry point
* avoid showing signs of affluence or wearing expensive jewellery
* avoid carrying large sums of cash or unnecessary valuables
* avoid isolated or deserted areas
* avoid walking alone at night
* be aware of your surroundings, particularly in crowded and tourist areas
* be extra cautious when withdrawing cash from ATMs

##### San José

In San José, high-risk areas for theft include:

* the Coca-Cola bus terminal area, located between El Paso de la Vaca, Calle 12 and the Coca-Cola market
* the inner downtown area, located between the San Juan de Dios Hospital, the National Museum, Avenida 1 and Avenida 14

* hotels
* supermarkets

When leaving your vehicle, always manually check that the doors are locked since “key jammers” could be used to interrupt signals from key fobs, preventing car doors from locking.

If driving in Costa Rica:

* always keep doors and windows closed and locked
* do not leave valuables within reach or in plain sight
* park your vehicle in a secure area, especially at night
* never leave personal belongings unattended in a vehicle, even in the trunk

* ensure emergency assistance and car insurance are offered by the rental agency when renting a car

### Adventure tourism

Outdoor activities, such as white-water rafting, scuba diving, bungee jumping, canopy touring and other adventure sports can be dangerous if unprepared. Trails are rarely marked, and weather conditions can change rapidly, even in summer.

Safety features on small boats used in river and lake excursions are not always reliable.

Life-threatening fauna such as jaguars, pumas, wild pigs and poisonous snakes are common in the densely wooded areas.

If you intend to practice adventure tourism:

* never do so alone, and don’t part with your expedition companions
* obtain detailed information on your activity and on the environment in which you will be before setting out
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* avoid venturing off marked trails
* don’t camp or sleep overnight on beaches
* ensure that you’re adequately equipped and bring sufficient water
* stay informed of weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* know the symptoms of acute altitude sickness, which can be fatal
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary
* refrain from using facilities or equipment if you have doubts on their safety

#### National parks

You must obtain a permit to access national parks.

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety are generally poor throughout the country. Costa Rica has one of the highest traffic accident rates in the world.

#### Road conditions

Most roads are not paved and those paved are generally in poor condition. Driving conditions may be hazardous, especially during the rainy season, due to:

* potholes
* sharp curves
* lack of traffic signs
* landslides
* narrow or unpaved roads

#### Driving habits

Drivers don’t respect traffic laws. Motorists often drive without lights at night.

While driving:

* remain vigilant when stopped at lights or stop signs
* keep doors locked and windows closed at all times
* keep your valuables out of plain sight
* avoid travel at night

### Public transportation

#### Buses

Public bus transportation is unreliable. Schedules and routes may not be accurate. Vehicles are often late due to traffic and road conditions. Itineraries may also vary from the ones originally announced.

Pickpockets often target tourists in public buses.

If travelling by public bus:

* keep your ID and valuables with you
* avoid placing your bags in the overhead compartment or under your seat
* avoid sleeping

Police checks of passengers on public transportation also occur. Officers often use those checks to determine if foreigners have overstayed the 90-day visa exemption period.

Always carry your proof of legal stay on your person.

#### Taxis

Official taxis are safe. They are orange at the airport and red with a yellow triangle on the side elsewhere in the country.

* Use official taxis only booked ahead of time
* Never board taxis at taxi stands or flag taxis in the street
* Note the driver’s name and plate number
* Make sure the driver uses the meter
* Never use shared taxis
