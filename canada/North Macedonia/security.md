## Safety and security

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs. Foreigners could be targeted.

Thieves work alone or in groups and may use various techniques to distract you and steal your belongings. Groups of street children sometimes gather around their victim to ask for money while one of them pickpockets them.

Thieves are particularly active in Skopje’s downtown pedestrian zone, and in other crowded public areas such as:

* markets
* public transportation hubs and facilities, including Skopje International Airport
* hotel lobbies
* restaurants, patios and outdoor cafés
* tourist sites and attractions

While you’re in North Macedonia:

* ensure that your belongings, including your passport, are secure at all times
* don’t keep your passport and other types of ID in the same place and carry a photocopy rather than the original
* avoid showing signs of affluence or wearing expensive jewellery
* avoid carrying large sums of cash or unnecessary valuables
* avoid deserted streets at night
* pay attention to your surroundings, particularly in crowded and tourist areas and when withdrawing cash from ATM

#### Residential break-ins

Residential break-ins may occur, especially in main cities. Burglars sometimes target houses or apartments owned or rented by foreigners.

* Choose well-secured accommodation
* Make sure you lock doors and windows at night and when you’re away

#### Vehicles

Car theft, break-ins and carjacking occur. Rental and luxury vehicles are a target of choice.

* Familiarize yourself with your route before starting a trip
* Keep your windows and doors locked at all times
* Keep your belongings out of reach
* Use secure parking facilities, especially overnight
* Never leave belongings unattended in a vehicle, even in the trunk

#### Violent crime

Organized crime-related violence occurs. The use of firearms is common.

While violent incidents don’t typically target foreigners or tourists, there is a risk of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

Although rare, inter-ethnic violence may take place in certain areas of the country.

Smuggling and other criminal activities may also occur, particularly in the areas bordering Kosovo and Albania.

Always be vigilant and aware of your surroundings.

### Fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud occurs. When using debit or credit cards:

* pay careful attention when others are handling your cards
* use ATMs located in public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

#### Cybercrime

Cybercrime occurs. Criminals may compromise public Wi-Fi networks to steal credit card or personal information.

* Avoid using unsecured public Wi-Fi networks
* Avoid making purchases on unencrypted websites
* Use sound judgement when posting information on social media
* Be particularly vigilant when contacting or meeting individuals known over the Internet
* Never click a suspicious link in an email or text message asking for your credit card details

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in Europe. Terrorist attacks have occurred in a number of European cities. Terrorist attacks could occur at any time.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places. Be particularly vigilant during:

* sporting events
* religious holidays
* public celebrations
* major political events, such as elections

Terrorists may use such occasions to mount attacks.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations take place frequently. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Celebratory gunfire

Firing weapons to celebrate is common in North Macedonia. It sometimes coincides with fireworks displays and may take place:

* on weddings
* on certain holidays and days of national observance
* following electionsafter soccer matches and sporting events

Injuries and cases of death due to stray bullets do occur. Avoid areas where celebratory fire is taking place.

### Bomb threats

There have been a number of bomb threats emailed to locations in North Macedonia since late 2022, notably to locations in Skopje. Local law enforcement responded to each bomb threat and all have been false alarms.

Bomb threats and hoaxes can target any location, including, but not limited to:

* shopping malls
* transportation hubs
* government facilities
* schools
* public spaces

If you are in an area affected by a bomb threat, follow the instructions of local authorities and evacuate calmly.

### Mountain activities

Mountain activities, such as hiking, can be dangerous, especially if they are not well-organized. Trails are not always marked and weather conditions can change rapidly, even in summer.

If you intend to go hiking or climbing:

* never do so alone
* consider hiring an experienced guide from a reputable company
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* ensure that you’re properly equipped
* stay informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary
* obtain detailed information on trekking routes before setting out
* avoid venturing off marked trails

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety can vary greatly throughout the country.

Secondary roads are poorly maintained and lack adequate lighting. In mountainous areas, most roads lack guard rails and are unpaved. Ice and snow make driving hazardous in winter. Farm equipment and stray animals pose additional risks.

Drivers don’t respect traffic laws. They may be reckless.

Exercise caution when travelling by road, especially after dark.

### Public transportation

Public transportation in Skopje is reliable. Train and bus services connect the capital with the main cities of the country.

#### Taxis

Taxis are widely available and reliable.

* Use only officially marked taxis
* Negotiate fares in advance, or insist that the driver use the meter, as you may be overcharged
