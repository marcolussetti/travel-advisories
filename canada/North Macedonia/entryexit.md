# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

The authorities of a country or territory decide who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the North Macedonian authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country's entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 3 months beyond the date you expect to leave from North Macedonia.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

You should also be aware that current systems used by some countries and travel companies may not recognize the “X” gender identifier. You may still be asked to provide your sex/gender information as either male or female when travelling.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Visas

Tourist visa: not required for stays up to 90 days  
Business visa: not required for stays up to 90 days  
Student visa: not required for stays up to 90 days

### Overstay

If you want to stay longer than 90 days but did not apply for a visa prior to arriving in North Macedonia, you must leave the country and apply for the appropriate visa at a North Macedonian embassy or consulate.

If you stay beyond the permitted number of days, you could face heavy fines or be denied entry when returning to North Macedonia.

### Registration

You must register your presence within 24 hours of arrival in North Macedonia. Commercial accommodations will generally file the registration on your behalf.

If you’re staying in a non-commercial accommodation, you must register at the nearest police station.

You may face fines and difficulties upon departure if you fail to do so.

### Dual citizenship

If you hold North Macedonian citizenship and plan to stay outside of North Macedonia for longer than 3 months, you must register with the closest Embassy of the Republic of North Macedonia.

You may face difficulties when re-entering North Macedonia if you fail to do so.
