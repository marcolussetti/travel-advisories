# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs. Residential break-ins also occur, particularly in Chuuk.

Violent crime is rare. Police capacity to respond to crime and other incidents is very limited.

* Ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Ensure residential doors are locked at all times

### Women’s safety

Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse. Sexual assaults occur.

* Be aware of your surroundings
* Avoid walking alone after dark or in remote areas

### Water activities

#### Swimming

Beaches are not usually supervised by lifeguards. Tidal changes can cause powerful currents in the coastal lagoons that surround the islands. Riptides are common. Several drownings occur each year.

Rescue services may not be consistent with international standards.

* Consult residents and tour operators for information on possible hazards and safe swimming areas
* Follow the instructions and warnings of local authorities

#### Diving

Tour operators may not adhere to international standards.

If you undertake adventure sports, such as diving:

* choose a well-established and reputable company that has insurance
* ensure that your travel insurance covers the recreational activities you choose.

In doubt concerning the safety of the installation or equipment, don’t use them.
