### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Micronesian law doesnâ€™t criminalize sexual acts or relationships between persons of the same sex.

However, 2SLGBTQI+ persons could be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or sex characteristics.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Micronesia.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of Micronesia, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Micronesia.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Micronesia by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Micronesia to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.
