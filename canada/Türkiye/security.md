## Safety and security

### Political demonstrations

Since March 19, 2025, protests have been occurring across Türkiye, particularly in Istanbul.

Large-scale demonstrations may result in heightened police presence, road closures, public transportation and traffic disruptions, and can turn violent.

Several protest bans are in effect across the country, including in Ankara, Istanbul and Izmir. For Istanbul province, this includes restrictions to freedom of movement for people suspected of participating in protests.

If you participate in demonstrations or travel to locations where demonstrations are taking place, you could be questioned by law enforcement and/or detained.

* Avoid demonstrations
* Review your travel plans and be prepared to change them on short notice
* Exercise caution
* Monitor local media for the latest information

### Borders with Iraq and Syria

Despite counter-terrorism operations conducted by Turkish and Iraqi security forces, a threat of terrorism subsists at the border between Türkiye and Iraq. Violent attacks on sites held by terrorist groups or against Turkish and Iraqi security forces occur frequently.

Extremist groups have carried out attacks at border crossings and other locations in Syria close to the Turkish border. The Turkish government has declared some areas in villages along the border with Syria special security zones as part of cross-border military operations.

Foreigners and individuals associated to Western countries are targets for kidnappings and violence by terrorist groups in border areas with Iraq and Syria.

Border areas with Iraq and Syria are subject to extremely dangerous military activities, such as:

* drone attacks
* heavy gunfire
* improvised explosive devices (IEDs) explosions

If you travel near the border with Iraq and/or Syria despite the advisory in effect:

* exercise extreme caution
* expect a heightened military presence and movement restrictions
* avoid travelling after dark
* monitor local and international media to stay informed on current clashes
* follow instructions from local authorities and security forces

### Southeast region

Terrorist groups have launched deadly terrorist attacks against Turkish security personnel in several cities and regions in the south and southeast of the country.

* Remain vigilant
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local and international media

There is a risk, particularly to foreigners, of kidnapping in the area (see Kidnapping, below). Maintain a high level of vigilance at all times.

Avoid overland travel. If you must, drive during the day and stay on major roads. Don’t use public transportation.

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in Türkiye.

There have been armed attacks in crowded places in major cities, such as Ankara and Istanbul. Additional attacks could occur at any time.

Targets could include:

* Turkish military and government facilities
* Schools, including universities
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners
* public transportation
* cultural venues

Turkish security officials may set up roadblocks or close streets when they receive reports on specific threats. It is common for Turkish police to patrol proactively and conduct routine ID checks.

Be particularly vigilant during:

* sporting events
* cultural events, such as concerts
* religious holidays
* public celebrations
* major political events, such as political rallies for elections

Terrorists may use such occasions to mount attacks.

### Mountaineering and hiking

Mount Ararat, between the eastern provinces of Agri and Igdir, is designated a special military zone. You must hire the services of a locally licensed guide agency if you intend to hike in the area. A licensed company will obtain the necessary permits and assign you a registered Mountaineer to accompany you throughout your hike.

If you intend on engaging in mountaineering or hiking:

* never do so alone and always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* ensure that you’re properly equipped and well informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary, including when you expect to be back to camp
* know the symptoms of high-altitude illnesses, which can be fatal
* obtain detailed information on trekking routes or ski slopes before setting out and do not venture off marked trails

Accurate information on mountain conditions can be difficult to obtain. Weather in mountainous areas can also be unpredictable.

### Identification

Random ID checks and ‎roadblocks may take place in large cities and on intercity roads.

Cooperate during ID checks and always carry your passport and visa or residence permit. Failure to produce these documents or non-compliance with Turkish officials during identity checks could result in fines, detainment or deportation.

Turkish authorities have detained and prosecuted large numbers of people over social media posts criticizing the government, state officials, president, military operations, etc. You could be subject to scrutiny if you posted similar comments, even if a post was published years ago or outside of Türkiye.

* Keep in mind the sensitivities
* Think twice before posting or reacting to online content criticizing the government
* Restrain and limit your social media footprint

### Kidnapping

There is a threat of kidnapping-for-ransom along Türkiye’s borders with Syria and Iraq. Extremist groups take advantage of porous borders and an unpredictable security situation to carry out operations and use kidnapping as a means of raising funds.

They may target the local population, foreigners and even foreign aid workers.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations may occur. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also disrupt traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Expect enhanced security measures and an increased police presence
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations
* Be prepared to modify your plans in case of disturbances

### Crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, can occur throughout Türkiye.

* Avoid showing signs of affluence
* Ensure that your belongings, passports and other travel documents are secure at all times
* If travelling by car, keep valuable belongings out of sight, windows closed and doors locked

Muggings, assaults and sexual assaults occur.

### Spiked food and drinks

Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery. Do not accept food and drinks from strangers, even if the wrapping or container appears intact.

Don’t go to down-market bars and neighbourhoods. One scam, particularly common in Istanbul, involves locals inviting tourists to bars for food and drinks and then forcing them to pay a steep bill.

Don’t accept letters, parcels or other items from strangers. Drug traffickers sometimes attempt to convince foreigners to deliver packages and messages into and out of Türkiye.

### Adulterated alcohol poisoning

Some people died after consuming methanol-adulterated alcohol.

* Be cautious if you choose to drink alcohol
* Buy alcohol only from licensed liquor stores or reputable bars and hotels
* Ensure the bottles are sealed and show no signs of alteration or counterfeiting
* Seek medical assistance if you begin to feel sick

### Fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud occurs. Be cautious when using debit or credit cards:

* pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others
* use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

If you’re travelling to Türkiye to meet someone you’ve only met online, or the person in Türkiye asks to wire money, you may be the victim of a scam. Don’t send money to someone you have never met in person.

### Women’s safety

There is a risk of sexual assault.

Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse. Be aware of your surroundings.

Dress conservatively, especially in areas outside major cities and coastal resorts.

### Stray animals

There are numerous stray dogs and cats in Türkiye. Dogs often travel in packs and could attack pedestrians and joggers.

Don’t attempt to feed or pet stray animals.

### Road safety

Türkiye has a modern road network. However, uneven surfaces and poorly marked lane changes near construction zones, are common.

Exercise caution, especially when driving in the rain. Severe weather conditions may seriously affect road conditions.

Ensure that your vehicle is in good repair. Avoid driving after dark outside of major cities or major roads.

Accidents are common. You may face the following hazards when driving in the country:

* reckless driving
* speeding
* vehicle breakdown due to poor maintenance practices
* dangerous road conditions
* inadequate lighting
* poor signage
* high-volume traffic congestion

If you come across an accident, don’t slow down or stop to observe.

If you are involved in an accident, lock your doors and windows and call 112 to notify the police.

Don’t move your vehicle until advised to do so by the police, even if your accident results in:

* blocked traffic routes
* injuries to those involved
* a disagreement
* a crowd starting to form

You may be permitted to move your vehicle after communicating with the police if you are on a busy road, once you have taken pictures of the scene.

Although pedestrians officially have the right of way, it may not be the case in practice.
