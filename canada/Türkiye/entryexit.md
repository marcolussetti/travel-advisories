# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from Turkish authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 60 days beyond the duration of stay indicated on your visa, e-Visa, visa exemption or residence permit.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

If you are travelling to Türkiye to seek medical services, apply for a medical visa through the HealthTürkiye online portal. You should also consult our advice on medical tourism under the [Health](https://travel.gc.ca/destinations/turkiye#health) section before applying for a medical visa.

If you are travelling to Türkiye and need a visa, use the official Turkish government site to apply online and purchase an e-visa before entering the country. Be cautious of third-party websites that offer help in getting any type of visa, as they may charge additional fees to provide information and submit applications for you. They do not operate on behalf of the Government of Türkiye.

If you plan to study or work in Türkiye, you must obtain a visa at a Turkish embassy or consulate before arriving in Türkiye. If you intend to work remotely from Türkiye, you must first obtain a ‘’Digital Nomad’’ visa by submitting the requested documentation on the government of Türkiye’s digital nomads online portal. If your documents are validated, you will receive a Digital Nomad Identification Certificate that you must present at a Turkish embassy, consulate or visa center to receive your visa.

To qualify for a subsequent visa-exempted entry for a 90-day period in Turkiye, you must leave the country for at least 90 days before being allowed to re-enter for another 90 days.

If you wish to remain in Türkiye for longer than 90 consecutive days, you must obtain a residence permit from the Provincial Directorate of Migration Management in the province in which you reside. If you overstay, you might be fined, deported or banned from future travel to Türkiye for a specific period of time.

### Entry stamp

Ensure Turkish immigration officials stamp your passport on arrival. Failure to produce a stamped passport is punishable by a fine, detention and deportation, and can lead to significant delays at departure.

### Dual citizenship

Dual Turkish-Canadian citizens must present a valid Turkish passport or piece of identification to enter the country.
