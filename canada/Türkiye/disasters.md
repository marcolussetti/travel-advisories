## Natural disasters and climate

### Earthquakes

T端rkiye is located in an active seismic zone.

In February 2023, severe earthquakes struck several provinces in southeastern T端rkiye resulting in tens of thousands of casualties and significant damage to critical infrastructure, buildings and residences.

If you are in an area that was affected by those earthquakes, you can expect continued:

* telecommunication and electricity disruptions
* limited food, water and hygiene options
* limited accommodation choices
* limited transportation alternatives to/from the area

In the event of an earthquake:

* follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders
* monitor local media for the latest developments
* landslides are possible in affected areas, and strong aftershocks may occur after the initial earthquake

### Floods

Severe rainstorms occur in various regions around T端rkiye, especially in the Black Sea region and coastal areas. Heavy rainfall can cause severe flooding and landslides, resulting in extensive damage to infrastructure and hampering the provision of essential services in the affected areas. Roads may become impassable and bridges damaged.

Droughts and snowstorms can also delay travel and disrupt essential services.

### Wildfires

Forest fires often occur during the summer months, particularly in provinces on the Mediterranean and Aegean coasts of T端rkiye.

Heavy smoke and ash fall may deteriorate the air quality in areas near active fires. They can also lead to road and air traffic disruptions and power outages.

In case of major fire:

* stay away from the affected areas, especially if you suffer from respiratory ailments
* follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders
* monitor local media for up-to-date information on the situation
