## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Identification

Authorities can request to see your ID at any time. If you fail to present valid identification documents upon request, you could face:

* fines
* arrest
* detention
* deportation
* entry ban for future travel into Türkiye

During your stay:

* carry the original version (not only photocopies or digital versions) of a valid government-issued ID, such as your passport, at all times.
* keep a digital copy of your ID and travel documents in case it is seized or lost
* follow the instructions of the local authorities requesting the documents

If you are temporarily in Türkiye, you should carry a valid passport that contains a Turkish entry stamp and a valid visa.

If you reside in Türkiye, you should carry your Turkish resident ID (Kimlik and/or Ikamet) and a valid passport that contains a Turkish entry stamp and a valid visa.

### Drugs

The use of illegal drugs is prohibited. Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect lengthy jail sentences and heavy fines.

Don't agree to carry any baggage that is not yours.

### Religious proselytism

Although religious proselytism is not illegal, some activities may be considered illegal and could lead to detention.

### Political discussions

Avoid discussions (including on social media) on historical and religious issues as well as on politics.

* Keep in mind the sensitivities
* Think twice before posting or reacting to online content criticizing the government
* Restrain/limit your social media footprint.

#### Online activities

Turkish authorities have detained and prosecuted people over social media posts criticizing the government, state officials, president, military operations. You could be subject to scrutiny even if a post was published years ago or outside of Türkiye.

Authorities have also targeted people and groups for:

* publishing statements
* organizing news conferences
* organizing or participating in nonviolent activities
* critical writing and online activism protesting the government, its policies, decisions and actions

Even if a case does not go to trial or ends in acquittal, people can be labelled as terrorism suspects and face adverse consequences due to investigations and criminal proceedings, including possible loss of employment and social exclusion.

### Photography

It is forbidden to photograph military or public installations. Avoid photographing public demonstrations or members of police or security forces. Cameras may be confiscated. Do not photograph people without their permission.

### Exports

Turkish antiquities and other cultural artifacts that are considered of historical value or of national importance cannot be exported. Seek advice from Turkish authorities prior to departure from Türkiye. If the item can be exported, you will require a sales receipt and the official museum export certificate issued by the Turkish customs office.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Turkish law does not prohibit sexual acts between individuals of the same sex. However, homosexuality is not widely socially accepted.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Türkiye, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Türkiye.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Türkiye, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Turkish court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Türkiye to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.
