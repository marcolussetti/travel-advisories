# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Border areas

In March 2025, Tajik, Uzbek and Kyrgyz authorities reached an agreement on the delimitation of their shared borders. Despite the agreement, tensions could arise during and after the delimitation process.

The southern regions are prone to smuggling activities, affecting the security situation in the south of the country and along the borders with Uzbekistan and Tajikistan.

You should be vigilant if you travel near border areas.

#### Uzbekistan

You should confirm with local authorities if border posts are open for travel before heading to Uzbekistan.

#### Tajikistan

The security situation at the border between Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan has improved, however, while limited cross-border travel is now possible, some checkpoints remain closed or restricted. Travellers may be subject to specific entry procedures and permit requirements.

In September 2022, violent clashes due to territorial disputes broke out at the border between the Sughd region of Tajikistan and the Batken region of Kyrgyzstan, including near the Vorukh enclave. The clashes resulted in numerous casualties, including civilians.

#### Landmines

Marked and unmarked minefields may be present in areas bordering the following countries, especially in uncontrolled areas:

* Tajikistan
* Uzbekistan

If you are traveling in any of these areas despite the advisory in effect:

* stay on main roads and paved surfaces
* avoid roadside ditches, shoulders and unmarked trails
* cross only at official border crossings
* strictly observe warning signs indicating the possible presence of landmines

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as mugging, pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs frequently.

Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times.

#### Violent crime

Violent crime is also common. Criminals, including organized gangs, target both locals and foreigners.

Target locations may include:

* bars
* parks
* areas near major hotels
* public transportation
* currency exchange booths
* shopping centres and markets

The police response is limited.

To minimize the risk of becoming a victim of crime:

* don’t walk or travel alone, especially at night
* don’t show signs of affluence
* avoid carrying large sums of money

### Common criminal strategies

#### Fraudulent police officers

Thieves posing as police officers have approached foreign travellers and ask them to pay alleged fines.

If you face with this situation, offer to follow the officer to the nearest police station to pay the alleged fine.

#### Fraudulent airport facilitators

Fraudulent “meet and greet” airport facilitators have lured travellers into cars and requested money.

* Make prior travel arrangements with your contacts
* Ask for identification upon arrival
* Don’t leave the airport with anyone who doesn’t show you their identification

#### Entertainment venues

Thieves may also target foreign travellers in tourist entertainment locations such as bars, nightclubs and other drinking establishments.

One or more individuals may propose to go to your hotel room or apartment. The individual will then try to provide access to your accommodation to its accomplices. You could be the victim of robbery, physical assault, and blackmailing.

Foreign travellers on foot, travelling alone or in small groups at night have been followed and robbed.

* Avoid walking or travelling alone, especially at night
* Always use a reputable taxi service in advance before leaving popular restaurants and places of recreation

#### Spiked food and drinks

Never leave your food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

#### Fraud

Credit card, Internet and ATM fraud is common.

* Pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others
* Use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business
* Avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* Cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* Check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations may occur. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism. Terrorist attacks could occur at any time.

Targets could include:

* government buildings and military installations
* schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

Be particularly vigilant during:

* sporting events
* religious holidays
* public celebrations
* major political events, such as elections

Terrorists may use such occasions to mount attacks.

### Road safety

Roads conditions and road safety are poor throughout the country. Drivers don't respect traffic laws. Accidents causing fatalities are common.

Roads are poorly maintained and inadequately lit.

Roads from Bishkek to Tashkent are hazardous during winter. The road between Almaty and Bishkek is difficult because of the many checkpoints set up between both cities.

Gas stations outside Bishkek and Osh are scarce.

* Make sure you're well prepared
* Plan for sufficient supply of gasoline, water and food
* Always carry a cell phone and chargers
* Keep a list of emergency contact numbers with you

### Public transportation

Public transportation is unsafe due to poor maintenance and reckless driving practices.

Avoid using public transportation.

#### Taxi

Use only officially marked taxis with meters or a trusted ride-sharing app. Avoid shared taxis and street taxis.

* Ask the driver to use the meter or pre-negotiate the fare
* Don't share a ride with strangers
