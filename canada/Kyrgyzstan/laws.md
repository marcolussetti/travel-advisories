## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.

### Photography

Photographing military installations or government buildings may result in a penalty.

Seek permission from local authorities before taking such photographs.

### Identification

Police officers regularly carry out identification checks. You might be detained if you’re stopped and can’t present ID.

You should keep:

* a legally certified copy of your visa, registration and passport with you at all times
* your passport and visa in safekeeping facilities
* digital copies of all your travel documents

### Dress and behaviour

Although Kyrgyzstan is officially a secular country, locals closely adhere to Islamic practices and beliefs, particularly in rural areas.

To avoid offending local sensitivities:

* dress conservatively
* behave discreetly
* respect religious and social traditions

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Kyrgyz law doesn’t criminalize sexual acts or relationships between persons of the same sex.

However, 2SLGBTQI+ travellers could be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or sex characteristics.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Kyrgyzstan.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of Kyrgyzstan, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Kyrgyzstan.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Kyrgyzstan by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Kyrgyzstan to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.
