# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

The authorities of a country or territory decide who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Laotian authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond the date you expect to leave Laos.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with a “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

You should also be aware that current systems used by some countries and travel companies may not recognize the “X” gender identifier. You may still be asked to provide your sex/gender information as either male or female when travelling.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Visas

Business visa: required

Electronic tourist visas can be obtained in advance by travellers planning to enter Laos through the Wattay International Airport or the Lao-Thai Friendship Bridge I.

Tourist visas can be obtained upon arrival at Wattay International Airport, Luang Prabang International Airport, Pakse International Airport and some “international” (that is, open to all foreign nationals) border crossings. Contact the nearest Laotian embassy or consulate to confirm where you can get a tourist visa. A passport photo and US$42 are required to obtain a visa upon entry.

### Entry stamp

Immigration offices at some border crossings are difficult to identify. Ensure that you obtain an entry stamp into Laos. Failure to do so can result in serious fines, detention and deportation.

### Travel to Xaisomboun

Travellers are required to obtain permission from local authorities prior to travel to certain parts of Xaisomboun Province. You may be refused entry to some areas of the province, particularly around Long Tieng.
