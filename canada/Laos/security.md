# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Xaisomboun province

There have been random shooting incidents near Xaisomboun town, in Xaisomboun province, since late 2015.

If you travel to this region despite the advisory:

* avoid travel after dark
* exercise extreme caution
* follow the instructions of local authorities

### Bokeo province

Criminals operate in the Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone, which is in the Ton Pheung district of Bokeo province, and along the borders with Thailand and Myanmar. The criminal activity includes drug and human trafficking as well as employment scams.

If you travel to these areas despite the advisory:

* avoid travel after dark
* exercise extreme caution
* follow the instructions of local authorities

Officials have heightened security measures in Bokeo province, including an increased military presence at checkpoints along the Lao-Thai border, following clashes between the Lao army and unidentified armed groups.

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Street crime is prevalent in cities and towns, including Vientiane, Luang Prabang and Vang Vieng.

Theft occurs frequently. Thieves on motorcycles grab bags and other valuables from pedestrians as well as from other motorcycle drivers and their passengers. Thieves also work in pairs to carry out distraction thefts.

During your trip:

* keep your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, in a secure place
* when walking, keep your bag on the side of your body that is facing away from the road
* do not show signs of affluence or wear expensive jewellery
* be aware of your surroundings, especially in busy tourist areas

#### Violent crime

Violent muggings involving weapons have occurred, particularly in Vientiane, Luang Prabang, Pakse and Vang Vieng.

Break-ins at hotels and guesthouses occur. Armed robberies occur occasionally.

Local police may not have the capacity to respond to crimes, especially at night.

During your trip:

* always keep doors and windows closed and locked
* avoid going out after dark
* travel in groups
* do not resist an attack

### Fraud

Report any fraud or scams to the local tourist police in the jurisdiction where the incident occurred before you leave the country.

#### Currency exchange scams

Be wary of money counting scams (currency exchange). Don't exchange large sums of money in one transaction. Get local currency from the bank or an ATM instead of a currency exchange kiosk.

#### Vehicle rental scams

Rent only from reputable companies, since some companies have been known to steal vehicles, particularly motorcycles, and charge for the loss. Never leave your passport as collateral when renting a vehicle, since they may be withheld until the charges are paid.

#### Credit card, debit card and ATM fraud

Credit and debit card as well as ATM fraud occurs frequently.

When using your debit or credit card:

* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* pay careful attention when others are handling your cards
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* use ATMs located in public areas or inside a bank or business
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

### Spiked food, drinks and other items

Never leave your food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Avoid accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as these items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

Some food and drinks, such as "happy pizzas" and "special shakes," may contain unspecified amounts of opium and other unknown substances. These items are sold in areas frequented by tourists, particularly in Vang Vieng. While these items may be easily accessible, taking any amount of opiates can be dangerous. Foreigners, including Canadians, have died of drug overdoses.

#### Methanol poisoning

Several foreigners in Vang Vieng have died or become severely ill as a result of alcohol poisoning from suspected methanol-adulterated alcohol. Methanol is extremely toxic and you can’t taste or smell it.

* Be vigilant if you choose to drink alcohol
* Avoid accepting free or extremely low-priced drinks
* Buy drinks only from licensed bars and restaurants
* In shops, buy alcohol only in sealed bottles and cans
* Follow orders issued by local authorities
* Do not purchase or consume Tiger brand vodka and whisky, which are prohibited
* Seek medical assistance immediately if you begin to feel sick

### Women's safety

Sexual assaults occur, particularly in Vientiane, Luang Prabang and Vang Vieng. Be particularly vigilant along hiking trails.

If you’re the victim of a sexual assault, you should report it immediately to the nearest Government of Canada office.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations are illegal in Laos but sometimes occur.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Adventure tourism

Outdoor activities, such as zip-lining and rock climbing, can be dangerous.

Tour operators may not meet Canadian safety standards.

Exercise extreme caution and carefully consider your safety when engaging in river-based activities, including in Vang Vieng. Travellers have died or been seriously injured while tubing or jumping/diving into the river. River levels can fluctuate considerably, and debris can make these activities dangerous. Avoid consuming alcohol or drugs before participating in river-based activities.

If you intend to participate in adventure tourism activities:

* share your itinerary with a friend or family member if you’re alone
* choose a reputable and well-established company that has insurance
* buy travel insurance that covers these types of recreational activities
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* ensure that you have proper equipment and bring sufficient water
* refrain from using equipment if you are unsure of its condition or safety
* stay on marked trails and consider hiring an experienced guide from a reputable company

### Tourist facilities

Tourist facilities outside Vientiane and Luang Prabang are limited.

Security officials may place foreigners under surveillance. Hotel rooms, telephones, fax machines and electronic communications may be monitored. Personal possessions in hotel rooms may be searched.

### Public transportation

Public transportation is unreliable and limited after dark. Vehicles may be in poor condition.

River travel is common in Laos. Safety standards are minimal. Speedboat travel is especially dangerous during the dry season (November to May). Lifejackets and helmets should be provided to and worn by passengers.

Do not travel on or across the Mekong River after dark. In some areas, the Laotian military has been known to shoot at boats after dark.

### Landmines

Landmines and unexploded ordnance pose a risk to travellers throughout the country, but particularly in:

* the Plain of Jars site
* Xiengkhouang province
* Lao-Vietnam border areas, including those traversing the former Ho Chi Minh Trail

 If you are travelling in the affected areas:

* be especially vigilant in remote areas
* stay on main roads
* avoid walking in fields/rural areas
* avoid roadside ditches, shoulders and unmarked trails
* only cross at official border crossings
* pay attention to signs indicating the possible presence of landmines
* report any suspicious items to local authorities

### Roads

#### Road conditions

Road conditions are poor throughout the country.

Driving conditions may be hazardous during the rainy season.

Driving can also be dangerous due to:

* insufficient lighting
* unpaved roads
* poorly maintained vehicles
* stray livestock

#### Driving habits

Drivers don’t always respect traffic laws. They can be aggressive and reckless.

If you plan to travel by car, consider hiring a driver.

If you choose to drive:

* always drive defensively
* plan your trip in advance, especially if you are visiting a rural area
* familiarize yourself with your itinerary before you leave
* avoid travelling after dark
* only use main roads and highways
