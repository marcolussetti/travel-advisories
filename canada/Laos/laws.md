## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Identification

Travellers are subject to search, detention and the possibility of fines by authorities if they can’t show suitable identification, such as a passport, and for not having an entry stamp in their passport.

Always carry identification and comply with requests to stop at checkpoints and roadblocks.

### Smoking

It is prohibited to import, export, sell, buy, possess or use shisha, heated tobacco products, e-cigarettes, vaporizers and their refills. Convicted offenders can expect heavy fines or jail sentences.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe and may include the death penalty.

* Pack your own luggage and monitor it closely at all times
* Never transport other people’s packages, bags or suitcases

### Illegal or restricted activities

#### Relationships between foreign citizens and Laotian citizens

Non-marital sexual relationships between foreign citizens and Lao citizens are against the law, as are various forms of cohabitation. Convictions for such offences can lead to prison sentences and large fines. Improper registration of a relationship to a Lao citizen can lead to similar penalties. Permission for marriage or engagement to a Lao citizen must be submitted in a formal application to Lao authorities.

#### Photography

Photographing sensitive installations is prohibited. This includes:

* military sites
* government buildings
* bridges
* airfields

Photography of military personnel is also prohibited.

Violators may be arrested and their equipment may be seized.

#### Other illegal activities

Other illegal activities include:

* religious proselytizing or distributing religious material
* panhandling
* nudity in public or at religious sites

Violators may be arrested, fined, imprisoned or deported.

### Driving

You must carry an International Driving Permit.

#### Rental vehicles

Travellers involved in traffic accidents have been required to pay compensation for property damage or injury, regardless of who the police determine to be at fault. Lao insurers will generally only meet a small proportion of the costs of an accident and refuse to cover compensation, which can be the largest expense related to an accident.

Do not leave your passport as collateral when renting vehicles, including motorcycles. Read rental contracts thoroughly to ensure that the vehicle is correctly insured to cover damages and theft.

### Culture

Public displays of affection, such as kissing, whether between opposite or same-sex couples, are not considered proper or polite.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Laos.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of Laos, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Laos.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Laos by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Laos to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Money

The currency of Laos is the kip (LAK).

The kip is not easily obtained or exchanged outside of Laos. U.S. dollars and Thai baht are commonly accepted.

ATMs are widely available. Major credit cards are accepted at some international hotels and tourist establishments. Cash advances can be obtained from some banks, although the bank commission rates are high.
