## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Identification

Travellers are subject to search, detention and the possibility of fines by authorities if they can’t show suitable identification, such as a passport, and for not having an entry stamp in your passport.

Always carry ID, and comply with requests to stop at checkpoints and roadblocks.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are strict and may include the death penalty.

### Illegal or restricted activities

Non-marital sexual relationships between foreigners and Laotian citizens are against the law, as are various forms of cohabitation with Laotian nationals. Convictions for such offences can lead to prison sentences and large fines. Improper registration of a relationship to a Laotian national can lead to similar penalties. Permission for marriage or engagement to a Laotian citizen must be submitted in a formal application to Laotian authorities.

Photography of government buildings and vehicles, as well as bridges, airfields and military installations or personnel, is prohibited. Violators may be arrested and their equipment, seized.

Laos is tolerant of a diversity of religions. Religious proselytizing or distributing of religious material, however, is strictly prohibited. Violators may be arrested or deported.

Panhandling is illegal and can lead to fines or imprisonment.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Laos.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of Laos, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Laos.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Laos by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Laos to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Culture

Public displays of affection, such as kissing, whether between opposite or same-sex couples, are not considered proper or polite.

### Money

The currency is the kip (LAK).

The LAK is not easily obtained or exchanged outside of Laos. U.S. dollars and Thai baht are commonly accepted.

ATMs are widely available. Major credit cards are accepted at some international hotels and tourist establishments. Cash advances can be obtained from some banks, although the bank commission rates are high.
