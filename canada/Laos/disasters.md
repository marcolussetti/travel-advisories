## Natural disasters and climate

### Climate change

Climate change is affecting Laos. Extreme and unusual weather events are becoming more frequent and may affect your travel plans. Monitor local media for the latest information.

### Typhoons and monsoons

The rainy (monsoon) season extends from May to November. During the rainy season, provinces along the Mekong River in southern Laos are especially prone to severe rainstorms that can cause flooding and landslides, resulting in significant loss of life, extensive damage to infrastructure and hampering the provision of essential services.
