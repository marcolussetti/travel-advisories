## Natural disasters and climate

### Climate change

Climate change is affecting Laos. Extreme and unusual weather events are becoming more frequent and may affect your travel plans. Monitor local media for the latest information.

### Typhoons and monsoons

The rainy season (monsoon) extends from May to November. It can bring typhoons and lead to severe flooding, especially in provinces along the Mekong River in southern Laos.

Seasonal flooding can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable due to mudslides and landslides. Bridges, buildings, and infrastructure may be damaged.

* Monitor local media for the latest information, including on road conditions
* Stay away from flooded areas
* Monitor weather reports
* Follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders
