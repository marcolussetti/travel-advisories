## Safety and security

### Crime

The crime rate is low. Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs.

Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times.

### Water activities

Coastal waters can be dangerous. Riptides are common.

Rescue services may be limited.

* Exercise caution when swimming
* Respect the flag warnings as they indicate water conditions and beach safety
* If you rent equipment or take scuba diving or sailing lessons, ensure your travel insurance covers such activities

### Road safety

Road conditions and safety are good throughout the island, but roads are narrow and can be congested.

Most of the time, there is only one road to get from one place to another. It often runs along the edge of the cliffs and the slopes are steep.

Accidents are becoming more and more frequent.

### Public transportation

There is no public transportation in Saint-Barthélemy.

Residents get around mainly by car and scooter. There are two taxi stations, one at the airport and the other at the docks in Gustavia.

#### Ferries

Ferry services connect St. Barthélemy to the port of Phillipsburg in Sint Maarten and to the port of Marigot in St. Martin.

### Air travel

We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.
