# Safety and security

## Safety and security

**Presidential elections**

Political tensions are high in the context of the presidential elections scheduled for October 2025. Announcements related to the electoral process could lead to protests and civil unrest.

During periods of high tension, authorities may strengthen security measures, restrict movement without notice and impose curfews.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

If you are in Cameroon:

* avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* avoid areas around government buildings, including the headquarters of Elections Cameroon (ELECAM)
* expect an increased security presence
* monitor local media for the latest information
* follow the instructions of local authorities
