### Roads

#### Road safety

There are major safety issues in Cameroon. The number of road accidents is high and often involve pedestrians. Police and emergency services assistance is limited, particularly in rural areas.

#### Road conditions

Road conditions vary throughout the country and at different times of the year. Main roads are generally well maintained, while secondary roads are in poor condition and dangerous. During the [rainy seasons](#rainy), road conditions deteriorate considerably and driving can become dangerous.

Roads can be dangerous due to:

### Public transportation

Public transport services are limited and not all are safe. Avoid using public transport services.

If you choose to take a taxi or using ridesharing applications:

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

2SLGBTQI+ persons could be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or sex characteristics.

2SLGBTQI+ persons have been victims of harassment and verbal or physical violence. Avoid public display of affection.

Cameroonian law criminalizes sexual acts and relationships between persons of the same sex. Persons accused of homosexuality risk heavy fines and prison sentences of up to 5 years.

2SLGBTQI+ travellers should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Cameroon.
