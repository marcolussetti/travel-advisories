## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect jail sentences and heavy fines.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Cameroonian law criminalizes sexual acts and relationships between persons of the same sex. Persons accused of homosexuality risk heavy fines and prison sentences of up to 5 years.

2SLGBTQI+ travellers should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Cameroon.

### Dress and behaviour

To avoid offending local sensitivities:

* dress conservatively
* avoid kissing in public
* behave discreetly
* respect religious and social traditions

#### Camouflage clothing

It’s illegal to wear, buy, sell or distribute military clothing in Cameroon. It is an offence for a civilian to wear camouflage or other military-style clothing.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Cameroon.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of Cameroon, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Cameroon.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Cameroon by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Cameroon to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Identification

Local authorities may request to see your identification at any time.

* Always carry valid identification
* Keep a photocopy of your passport and of your visa or travel permit in a safe place in case it’s lost or seized
* Keep a digital copy of your identification and travel documents

### Photography

Photography of sensitive installations is prohibited. This includes:

* airports
* ports
* military sites
* government buildings
* uniformed service people

Always ask permission before photographing official buildings or individuals.

### Driving

To drive in Cameroon you must have an International Driving Permit along your valid Canadian driver’s licence.

If you intend to stay in Cameroon for more than one year, you will require a Cameroonian driver’s licence. To obtain a Cameroonian driver's licence, you are required to present your Canadian driver’s licence to the Delegation of Public Transport in your town of residence.

Traffic accidents can quickly draw large crowds. Remain calm if there is a dispute, particularly in a public place. If you feel threatened by a large crowd, ask the local police to intervene.

#### **Traffic violations**

If a police officer asks you to pay a fine on the spot for a traffic violation, ask for a written copy of the fine, which can be paid later at a local courthouse or police station.

### Money

The currency is the Central African CFA franc (XAF), known in French as the “franc CFA d’Afrique centrale”.

Cameroon is largely a cash-based economy. Large stores and hotels may accept major credit cards or euros and U.S. dollars, but this should be confirmed when you book. Credit cards are rarely accepted outside international hotels.

#### Transferring money

You must obtain authorization from the Ministry of Finance to transfer money out of Cameroon. Transferring funds through a bank is time-consuming, and charges are levied.
