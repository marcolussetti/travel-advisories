# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Iraqi authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you use for travel.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months from the date of entry into Iraq.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Visas

Canadians must have a visa to visit Iraq.

After 10 days in the country, you must register your arrival with the Iraqi Residence Office (Ministry of Interior). After three months in Iraq, you must apply for a one-year residence permit.

You will be subject to additional screening measures prior to being issued an Iraqi visa if your passport contains an Israeli visa or border stamp. This does not apply to Canadians travelling to the region of Kurdistan.  

### Kurdistan Region of Iraq

You can obtain a 30-day visa for Kurdistan upon arrival at both Erbil International Airport and Sulaymaniyah International Airport. If you plan to travel outside of Kurdistan to other regions of Iraq, you must obtain an Iraqi visa prior to travelling to Iraq. If you are leaving via the airport in Baghdad without a visa, you may be required to pay a penalty fee at departure.
