## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

The work week is from Sunday to Thursday.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect long detention or even the death penalty.

#### Alcohol

A new law is prohibiting importing, manufacturing, and selling alcoholic beverages. It is being challenged in court, and its application at ports of entry and inside Iraq remains unclear. You should nonetheless avoid travelling to Iraq with alcohol or risk heavy fines if convicted.

Do not drink alcohol outside licensed facilities. There is a zero tolerance policy regarding drinking and driving.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Iraqi law prohibits sexual acts between individuals of the same sex.

In July 2024, amendments to the anti-prostitution law entered into effect in Iraq.

These amendments set out penalties for convicted offenders, including:

* large fines
* up to 15 years’ imprisonment for same-sex relations
* at least 7 years’ imprisonment and large fines for “promoting homosexuality”
* up to 3 years’ imprisonment for transgender persons, gender-affirming medical interventions and those who “intentionally act like women”

2SLGBTQI+ persons should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Iraq.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Iraq.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of Iraq, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

### Custody

According to Iraqi law, the child of a male Iraqi national is considered an Iraqi national. Even if the name of the child is written in the mother’s foreign passport, Iraqi authorities may consider the child an Iraqi national and the child will require the father’s permission to travel.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Iraq.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Iraq by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Iraq to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Identification

You must carry photo identification as well as a legally certified copy of your visa and registration at all times. Keep a photocopy of your passport, visa and registration in a safe place, in case they are lost or confiscated.

### Customs

Customs authorities strictly enforce regulations concerning the import or export of pieces of art and antiquities. It is strictly forbidden to take antiquities, archeological finds or antique carpets out of Iraq.

There are strict laws regarding:

* purchase and exportation of antiquities and objects of special significance to the country's cultural heritage
* access, excavation, research, filming and photographing of archeological sites

To avoid any difficulties, make sure you:

* obtain and carry the required legal paperwork to purchase or export antiquities
* have the proper permit to conduct activities related to cultural heritage and archeological sites

Failure to comply can lead to severe punishment, including heavy fines, jail sentences and possibly the death penalty.

### Money

The currency is the Iraqi dinar (IQD). The economy is primarily cash-based. U.S. dollars are accepted. There are very few ATM’s.

You cannot leave Iraq with more than US$10,000 in cash, unless you declared the amount when you entered the country.
