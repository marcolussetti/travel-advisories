### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect lengthy prison sentences or even the death penalty.

Do not drink alcohol outside of licensed facilities. There is a zero-tolerance policy regarding drinking and driving.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Iraq.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of Iraq, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

### Child custody

Under Iraqi law, any child born to a male Iraqi citizen, including those with dual citizenship, is considered an Iraqi citizen. Even if the mother is a foreign national, Iraqi authorities may still consider the child as Iraqi, in which case the father’s authorization would be required for the child to travel outside of Iraq.

### Marriage

Iraq is a parliamentary republic, but Iraqi law closely adheres to Islamic principles and beliefs, which are the main source of legislation in the country.

In Iraq, marriages between Canadian and Iraqi citizens are subject to the rules of conduct and Islamic law.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Iraq.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Iraq by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Iraq to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.
