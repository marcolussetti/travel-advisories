## Natural disasters and climate

### Dust storms

The weather is very dry and hot from May to October. Sand storms and dust storms may occur any time, particularly during the summer months.

Sand-laden winds can blow at high speeds for days, creating difficult driving conditions. Poor visibility can also affect flights. These storms can also cause respiratory problems, which can be fatalÂ for some individuals.

During a storm:

* stay indoors
* keep windows closed
* follow the instructions of local emergency services personnel
* monitor local media for up-to-date information on the situation

### Flooding

Seasonal flooding can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable and bridges damaged.

* Avoid the affected areas
* Keep informed of regional weather forecasts
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
