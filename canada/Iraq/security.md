# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Heightened tensions in the Middle East

There are heightened tensions in the region and the security situation could deteriorate significantly without notice. In the event of escalation, there could be disruptions to movement and transportation, including:

* border closures or restrictions
* flight cancellations
* airspace closures

If you're in the region, you should:

* monitor local and international media to stay informed of the rapidly evolving situation
* be vigilant and follow the instructions of local authorities at all times, including any orders to shelter in place
* sign up with the [Registration of Canadians Abroad](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/registration) service to receive important information specific to your location
* ensure that your travel documents and those of your family are up to date

### Border areas

Despite counter-terrorism operations and regional peace efforts, the northern borders of Iraq remain dangerous due to the presence of terrorist groups and occasional military strikes against them. People suspected of illegally crossing the Iraq-Syria border risk being detained by the Iraqi authorities and if convicted, sentenced to up to 15 years in prison.

#### Unexploded ordnances

Despite clearing efforts, unexploded ordnance from previous wars in the region continue to pose a security risk throughout Iraq, especially in border areas with Iran and Kuwait. The following governorates are also affected due to past terrorist activity:

* Kirkuk
* Salah ad-Din
* Nineveh
* Diyala
* Anbar

If you suspect that unexploded ordnance may be present:

* be extremely vigilant, especially in remote areas
* stay on paved and main roads
* don’t walk in fields
* avoid roadside ditches, shoulders and unmarked trails
* report any suspicious items to local authorities

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in Iraq, especially in certain northern and western governorates, and in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq.

Despite international and Iraqi counter-terrorism operations, terrorist groups remain active in the country, including in Baghdad. Additional attacks could occur.

Attacks have involved:

* suicide vests
* improvised explosive devices (IEDs)
* vehicle-borne IEDs
* rockets and mortars
* assault weapons

Targets could include:

* government buildings
* schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners
* cultural venues
* Iraqi and international security forces

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

Be particularly vigilant during:

* sporting events
* religious holidays
* public celebrations
* major political events, such as elections

Terrorists may use such occasions to mount attacks.

### Crime

#### Violent crime

Organized criminal groups are active throughout Iraq, especially in southern governorates. Many individuals possess weapons, which increases the likelihood of violent spillovers. Armed clashes erupt regularly between rival tribes and militias and with Iraqi security forces. Kidnappings of civilians for ransom or for political and religious reasons also occur. You should avoid going outside after dark as security conditions worsen at night.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

2SLGBTQI+ persons face extreme discrimination, harassment and violence, including by police officers, based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression or sex characteristics.

This includes:

* kidnapping
* torture
* sexual assault
* murder

Iraqi law prohibits sexual acts between individuals of the same sex.

In July 2024, amendments to the anti-prostitution law entered into effect in Iraq.

These amendments set out penalties for convicted offenders, including:

* large fines
* up to 15 years’ imprisonment for same-sex relations
* at least 7 years’ imprisonment and large fines for “promoting homosexuality”
* up to 3 years’ imprisonment for transgender persons, gender-affirming medical interventions and those who “intentionally act like women”

2SLGBTQI+ persons should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Iraq.

### Women’s safety

Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations may occur, especially in larger cities. In the past, there have been clashes between protestors and security forces, who used tear gas, water cannons, and live ammunition to disperse crowds.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Checkpoints

Official security checkpoints conducting ID checks are common across the country. Militias sometimes set up unofficial checkpoints and force the payment of bribes. There is a risk of violence and arbitrary arrest at these checkpoints

* Exercise caution at all times
* Carry the original version, not only photocopies or digital versions, of a valid government-issued ID, such as your passport, at all times
* Keep a digital copy of your ID and travel documents in case they are seized or lost
* Follow the instructions of the individuals requesting the documents

### Curfews

Authorities impose curfews on short notice throughout the country. Monitor local media to stay informed.

### Cellular network coverage

Cellular network coverage is adequate in large cities, but unreliable or sometimes unavailable in remote areas.

If you plan to travel to remote areas:

* share your itinerary with a friend or family member if you’re alone
* keep a supply of water, food and fuel if you’re driving
* carry an emergency kit

### The Arba’ een

The Arba’ een pilgrimage in 2026 will take place around August 3.

The event attracts a large number of pilgrims each year, from several foreign countries. There is an increased security risk during the pilgrimage as Iraqi authorities may not be able to conduct ID checks on all individuals entering Iraq, some of whom enter illegally. Iraqi security forces have thwarted attacks targeting Arba’een pilgrims in the past.

Before and during the pilgrimage, you can expect:

* large crowds
* a heavy presence of security forces
* street closures
* disruptions to transportation, which start around a week before the event

limited availability of accommodation

If you travel to Iraq during the pilgrimage:

* always be aware of your surroundings
* ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times

### Piracy

Pirate attacks and armed robbery against ships occur in coastal waters, particularly in the northern Gulf, Gulf of Oman, Northern Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden and Bab El Mandeb regions. Mariners should take appropriate precautions.

### Road safety

Drivers do not respect traffic laws and speeding and tailgating are common practices.

Travel by road remains highly dangerous. Fatal roadside bombings and attacks on military and civilian vehicles continue to happen. There is also a risk of carjacking and robbery.

Due to the country’s high liability risk, it is difficult to obtain car insurance.

### Public Transportation

#### Buses

Buses run irregularly and routes are subject to frequent changes. Rundown transit vehicles are frequently involved in accidents.

#### Trains

Avoid travelling by rail, as the rail system is old and poorly maintained.

### Mosul Dam

A dam failure can’t be predicted, but could cause significant flooding and disrupt essential services from Mosul to Baghdad, along the Tigris River as well as areas adjoining the dam. Monitor local media reports and prepare contingency plans. The Government of Canada has a very limited ability to provide consular services in Iraq.

We don't make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.
