## Safety and security

### Information for Canadians in the Middle East

Heightened tensions in the region could pose security risks in neighbouring countries.

This may result in:

* travel disruptions, including flight cancellations and airspace closures
* military debris falling in various locations

You should:

* monitor local and international media to stay informed of the rapidly evolving situation
* follow the instructions of local authorities at all times
* be vigilant and prepared to shelter in place

If you encounter any debris or fragments:

* move away from them immediately
* contact local authorities

### Threats to foreigners

Foreigners and individuals associated to Western countries are targets for kidnappings and violence by terrorist groups.

If you travel to Iraq despite the advisory in effect:

* always exercise extreme caution
* choose accommodations that provide adequate security and transportation services
* get advice or close protection from a private security company
* have contingency plans in place

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in Iraq.

Car bombings, vehicle ambushes, drones, mortar and rocket attacks occur regularly across the country, including in Baghdad and residential areas. Terrorist groups are particularly active in the northern and western parts of Iraq.

Despite regular counter-terrorism operations by Iraqi security forces, additional attacks are likely to occur.

Targets could include:

* government buildings
* schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners
* cultural venues
* Iraqi and international security forces

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

Be particularly vigilant during:

* sporting events
* religious holidays
* public celebrations
* major political events, such as elections

Terrorists may use such occasions to mount attacks.

### Border areas

Avoid travelling to border areas. You may encounter serious problems with local authorities when crossing borders or risk of injury or death as a result of ongoing clashes, air strikes or other violent incidents that are common to border areas in Iraq. People suspected of illegally crossing the Iraq-Syria border risk being detained by the Iraqi authorities and charged with terrorism, which can result in capital punishment.

### Crime

Crime, including carjackings, robberies, kidnapping and corruption, is common. Security conditions get much worse after dark in most areas. Violent conflicts involving organized criminals, street gangs, militants, rival militias and Iraqi security forces pose grave dangers.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

2SLGBTQI+ persons face extreme discrimination, harassment and violence, including by police officers, based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression or sex characteristics.

This includes:

* kidnapping
* torture
* sexual assault
* murder

### Women’s safety

Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse.

### Demonstrations

Violent demonstrations and attacks are common throughout Iraq.

Clashes between protestors and security forces can occur. Security forces may use tear gas, water cannons, and live ammunition to disperse crowds.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Checkpoints

Security checkpoints are common across the country. An Iraqi police or army uniform is not a guarantee that the wearer is operating in an official capacity.

* Be very respectful and cooperate fully at security checkpoints
* Exercise particular caution at ad hoc checkpoints, where murders, kidnappings and robberies frequently occur

### Curfews

Authorities impose curfews on short notice throughout the country. Monitor local media in order to stay informed.

### Cellular Network

Telecommunications services are very poor or non-existent in remote areas. Cellular network coverage is widespread in major cities.

### The Arba’ een

The next Arba’ een pilgrimage will take place on August 25, 2024.

The event attracts a large number of pilgrims each year.

Before and during the pilgrimage, you can expect:

* a heavy presence of security forces
* street closures
* disruptions to transportation
* limited available accommodations

If you travel to Iraq during the pilgrimage:

* be aware of your surroundings at all times
* ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times

### Piracy

Pirate attacks and armed robbery against ships occur in coastal waters, particularly in the northern Gulf, Gulf of Oman, Northern Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden and Bab El Mandeb regions. Mariners should take appropriate precautions.

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety are poor throughout the country. Drivers do not respect traffic laws and speeding and tailgating are common practices.

Travel by road remains highly dangerous. Fatal roadside bombings and attacks on military and civilian vehicles continue to happen. There is also a risk of carjacking and robbery.

Due to the country’s high liability risk, it is difficult to obtain car insurance.

### Public Transportation

#### Busses

Busses run irregularly and routes are subject to frequent changes. Rundown transit vehicles are frequently involved in accidents.

#### Trains

Avoid travelling by rail, as the railroad is old and poorly maintained.

### Mosul Dam

The Government of Iraq has begun to take measures to improve the structural integrity of the Mosul Dam.

A dam failure could cause significant flooding and disruptions to essential services from Mosul to Baghdad, along the Tigris River as well as areas adjoining the dam. A failure of the Mosul Dam cannot be predicted. Monitor local media reports and prepare contingency plans. The Government of Canada cannot provide consular services if there is a dam failure.

### Air travel

We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.
