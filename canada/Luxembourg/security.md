## Safety and security

### Crime

The crime rate is low in Luxembourg.

However, petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs:

* on public transportation
* around train stations
* at the airport
* at youth hostels
* at hotel lobbies in the city of Luxembourg

Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times.

Carjacking incidents occur throughout the country. Ensure that valuables in vehicles are kept out of sight. Drive with the windows closed and car doors locked.

Thieves will sometimes pose as undercover police officers and demand an on-the-spot fine for minor offences (littering, for example). Be cautious of these imposters; a legitimate officer will never ask for cash payment for a fine.

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in Europe. Terrorist attacks have occurred in a number of European cities. There is a potential for other violent incidents.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

### Public alert system

Luxembourg maintains a public alert system on terrorism and communicates threat level changes through local media and social media.

### Road safety

Traffic congestion in urban areas can be a problem.

If your vehicle has been hit and you feel your personal safety is at risk, do not leave your vehicle. Call the police or drive immediately to the nearest police station.

### Public transportation

Public transportation is fast and reliable in Luxembourg.

Since February 2020, public transport is free throughout Luxembourg for trains, trams and buses (RGTR, TICE, AVL). First class tickets, however, still require payment. All passengers must carry a personal identity document because conductors may ask for them at any time.

#### Taxis

Opt for officially marked taxis.

Taxi fares are no longer regulated in Luxembourg. Each taxi is free to apply its own rates. However, they are required to clearly display the fares.

Ask the driver for a detailed list of tariffs.
