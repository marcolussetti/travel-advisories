# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing, bag snatching and theft from vehicles, is common.

Be particularly vigilant in crowded public areas such as:

* buses, trains, bus and train stations, and airports
* youth hostels
* hotel lobbies

During your trip:

* keep your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, in a secure place
* do not show signs of affluence or wear expensive jewellery
* do not carry large sums of cash or valuables unnecessarily
* be aware of your surroundings, especially in busy tourist areas
* never leave personal belongings in plain sight or unattended in a vehicle, even in the trunk
* always drive with the windows closed and car doors locked

Home burglaries occur, especially around Christmas and the summer holidays, and can turn violent.

* Stay in accommodations with adequate security measures
* Keep doors and windows locked when you are away
* If you're threatened by armed criminals, stay calm and do not resist

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in Europe. Terrorists have carried out attacks in several European cities and further attacks are likely.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including police stations
* schools, including universities
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners
* cultural venues

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

Be particularly vigilant during:

* sporting events
* religious holidays
* public celebrations
* major political events, such as elections

Terrorists may use such occasions to mount attacks.

The Government of Luxembourg maintains a public alert system on terrorism and communicates threat-level changes online and through social media. Luxembourg’s current threat level is 2, “real but abstract,” on a scale of 4.

### Fraud

#### Police impersonation scam

Individuals posing as police officers have approached tourists and asked them to pay on-the-spot fines for minor offences.

If you face a similar situation:

* offer to go to the nearest police station
* ask to see police credentials
* remain vigilant
* do not hand over your money or documents unless you feel threatened

### Spiked food, drinks and other items

Never leave your food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Avoid accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as these items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations occur sometimes and usually take place on days of political importance and during international summits held in Luxembourg.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Roads

#### Road safety

Road safety may vary considerably across the country.

From Monday to Friday, hundreds of thousands of cross-border workers head into and out of Luxembourg City. Accidents are frequent on highways from France, Belgium and Germany during morning and evening traffic hours.

#### Road conditions

Driving can be dangerous during the fall and winter due to fog and ice.

#### Driving habits

Since there are many cross-border drivers, their driving habits may not align with local traffic laws.

Always drive defensively, especially during traffic hours.

### Public transportation

Public transportation is reliable and free in Luxembourg.

All passengers must carry photo identification because conductors may ask for it at any time.

#### Taxis

Only use officially marked taxis, which display a price list. Check the rates before getting into a taxi, as they may vary from one taxi to another. Rates may increase in the evenings and on Sundays.

We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.
