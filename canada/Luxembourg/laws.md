## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Transfer to a Canadian prison

Canada and Luxembourg are signatories to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in Luxembourg to request a transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both Canadian and Luxembourgish authorities.

This process can take a long time, and there is no guarantee that the transfer will be approved by either or both sides.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect prison sentences or heavy fines.

Public intoxication and disorderly conduct is a criminal offence and can lead to an arrest or a heavy fine.

* Pack your own luggage and monitor it closely at all times
* Never transport other people’s packages, bags or suitcases

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Luxembourg.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Luxembourg, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Luxembourg.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Luxembourg, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Luxembourgish court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Luxembourg to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Driving

You must be at least 18 years old to drive in Luxembourg.

You can drive using a valid Canadian driver’s licence for up to 12 months.

You must carry an international driving permit.

If you become a legal resident of Luxembourg, you will need a local driver’s licence, which you must obtain within 12 months of becoming a resident. To exchange your Canadian driver’s licence, you need a certified criminal record check, which you must obtain from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police before you leave Canada.

Penalties for drinking and driving are severe. The legal blood alcohol limit is 0.02% for commercial and learner drivers and 0.05% for others.

Police regularly conduct sobriety checks.

Convicted offenders can expect:

* license suspension
* heavy fines
* a jail sentence

You should always have a blank accident report in your vehicle. If you are involved in a car accident that does not result in injury, you must exchange details with the drivers involved and complete the accident report before submitting it to your insurance company.

If you are involved in a car accident that results in injury or dispute, immediately report it to the police, who will officially assess the situation.

#### Mandatory equipment

From October to April, cars in Luxembourg must be equipped with winter or all-weather tires marked with ‘M.S.,’ ‘M+S,’ ‘M&S,’ or the alpine symbol, regardless of the vehicle’s country of registration.

You must always keep a warning triangle sign and a brightly colored driver’s vest in your vehicle.

Luxembourg authorities strictly enforce all road traffic laws, and police regularly conduct random road checks. You could be fined for minor infractions.
