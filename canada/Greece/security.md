In Athens, demonstrations and marches occur primarily in areas around:

In Thessaloniki, they occur primarily in areas around:

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. Demonstrations and strikes can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

#### Strikes

Strikes and pressure tactics occur regularly, particularly in key sectors such as transport and public health services. These strikes can disrupt travel and public services.

* Consult local media to be aware of strikes that may affect your stay or travel plans
* In the event of a transport strike, plan extra time to get to your destination

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing, purse snatching and luggage theft occurs. Tourists are frequently targeted.

Organized groups of thieves often use distraction techniques and are particularly active:

* at tourist sites and attractions
* in restaurants, patios and bars
* in hotel lobbies
* on public transportation, including metro and trains to and from Athens International Airport
* at airports, bus and railway stations including Larissa and Peloponnese stations in Athens
* on beaches

While you’re in Greece:

* ensure that your belongings, including your passport, are secure at all times
* don’t keep your passport and other types of ID at the same place and carry a photocopy rather than the original
* avoid showing signs of affluence

Violent crime, such as attacks committed by far-right extremists against individuals belonging to ethnic, religious or political minorities are uncommon, but do occur.

Always be vigilant and aware of your surroundings.

#### Spiked food and drinks

Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

#### Victims of crime

If you are a victim of a crime, go to the nearest police station to report it. Keep a copy of your report, as you may need it to make a claim to your insurance provider.

If you are a victim of sexual assault:

* seek medical assistance, whether or not you appear to have been physically harmed
* contact the local police immediately and ensure they file a report
* inform consular officials at the nearest Canadian embassy or consulate

The Greek police has a dedicated unit to assist foreign tourists and offers services in English and other languages.

You can contact the tourism police 24/7 anywhere in Greece by dialling the 1571 or the regular police at 100.

### Fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud occurs.

When using debit or credit cards:

* pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others
* use ATMs located in public areas or inside a bank or business

### Water activities

#### Swimming

Many beaches in Greece are supervised and enforce excellent safety procedures.

However, tidal changes and strong winds can cause hazardous currents and riptides.

Coral, urchin, jellyfish and other aquatic life found along reefs can poison, sting or cause infection if touched or stepped on.

* Always obey warning flags at beaches
* Ask local authorities about the presence of dangerous species and immediately seek medical assistance if you get hurt
* Wear reef shoes to protect yourself against stone and coral cuts or urchin stings
* Keep a safe distance from boats and restricted areas
* Avoid visiting beaches or coastal areas during periods of severe weather warnings
* Look out for signs warning of cliff erosion and falling rocks
* Don’t dive into unknown waters, as hidden rocks or shallow depths can cause serious injury or death
* Exercise caution and follow the advice of the local authorities

#### Recreational boating

If you are planning to go boating:

* know the capacity of your boat and don’t exceed it
* know and respect the navigation rules
* follow safe practices for all activities on the water
* keep a safe distance from areas reserved for certain activities such as snorkeling
* carry a VHF marine radio that will generate your position in case of emergency
* be prepared for emergencies

### Hiking

Outdoor activities, such as hiking, can be dangerous if unprepared. Trails are not always marked, and weather conditions can change rapidly, even in summer.

If you intend to go hiking or mountaineering:

* never do so alone, and do not part with your hiking companions
* obtain detailed information on your activity and on the environment in which you will be before setting out
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* avoid venturing off marked trails
* ensure that you’re adequately equipped and bring sufficient water
* stay informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* be aware of the presence of dangerous species such as snakes
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary
* dial 112 from a cellphone for any emergency

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety can vary greatly throughout the country.

Severe traffic congestion and difficult terrain may lead to hazardous driving conditions.

Accidents causing fatalities are common. Drivers often drive at excessive speeds and are reckless.

Drivers and speeding motorbikes don’t always yield to pedestrians or bicycles. Exercise caution when walking, crossing streets or biking.

#### Motorbikes

Accidents involving tourists renting motorbikes, scooters or mopeds are common, especially on the islands.

Small, unlicensed rental agencies do not always offer vehicles that comply with up-to-date safety standards.

* Read the rental contract carefully
* Inspect the equipment before renting it
* Never drink and drive
* Reduce your speed on rough and uneven terrain
* In the event of an accident, wait for police to arrive

You may not be able to file an insurance claim without a police report.

### Public transportation

Public transportation is generally safe and reliable. The bus network is extensive, and train services connect certain major cities. Athens has a modern metro system. Strikes may sometimes affect transportation services.

#### Taxis

Taxis are generally safe. Metered taxis are widely available.

There are fixed rates for transportation to and from Athens International Airport. Confirm the rate before departure.

#### Ferries

Ferries between mainland Greece and its islands meet European safety standards.

Weather conditions and strong winds can lead to cancellations or significant delays. Rough sea conditions may cause motion sickness, particularly on high-speed ferries.

* Pay attention to pre-departure notices from your carrier
* Always reconfirm departure schedule before heading to the port
