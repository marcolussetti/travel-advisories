If you are in or near an affected area:

* monitor local media for the latest regional weather forecasts
* follow the advice of local authorities, including evacuation orders and phone alerts from the 112 emergency notification system

### Meltemi wind

The Meltemi or Etesian is a strong wind that regularly sweeps the Aegean and the eastern Mediterranean seas from May to September. It can blow uninterruptedly for several days. This wind may bring high waves, strong currents and may disrupt transportation.

If you travel to Greece during this period:

* expect possible transportation delays or cancellations
* be very cautious if sailing or boating
* avoid swimming during rough sea conditions
* monitor the latest regional weather forecasts

### Wildfires

Wildfires are common between July and September, particularly in:

* the Peloponnese
* Central Greece
* Eastern Macedonia and Thrace
* the northern areas of Athens.

The air quality in areas near active fires may deteriorate due to heavy smoke.

In case of a major fire:

* stay away from affected areas, particularly if you suffer from respiratory ailments
* follow the advice of local emergency services personnel, including evacuation orders
* monitor local media for up-to-date information on the situation
