### Seismic activity

Since February 1, 2025, a series of earthquakes have occurred in the Aegean Sea. The tremors have been felt in the Cyclades Islands, including in Santorini, Anafi, Ios, and Amorgos. Further earthquakes could occur.

Local authorities are taking preventive measures.

On February 6, 2025, a state of emergency was declared in Santorini. There is a serious risk of landslides and rockfalls due to the ongoing tremors.

Greece is located in an active seismic zone. Major earthquakes could occur and can cause significant damage.

Santorini and Nisyros islands have active volcanoes.

If you’re travelling near an active volcano or are practising volcano tourism:

* closely monitor volcanic activity levels through local media and official sources
* ensure that you’re well informed about conditions that may pose a hazard
* follow the advice of local authorities

### Meltemi wind

The Meltemi or Etesian is a strong wind that regularly sweeps the Aegean and the eastern Mediterranean seas from May to September. It can blow uninterruptedly for several days. This wind may bring high waves, strong currents and may disrupt transportation.

If you travel to Greece during this period:

* expect possible transportation delays or cancellations
* be very cautious if sailing or boating
* avoid swimming during rough sea conditions
* monitor the latest regional weather forecasts

### Wildfires

Wildfires are common between July and September, particularly in:

* the Peloponnese
* Central Greece
* Eastern Macedonia and Thrace
* the northern areas of Athens.

The air quality in areas near active fires may deteriorate due to heavy smoke.

In case of a major fire:

* stay away from affected areas, particularly if you suffer from respiratory ailments
* follow the advice of local emergency services personnel, including evacuation orders
* monitor local media for up-to-date information on the situation
