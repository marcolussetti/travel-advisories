### Identification

You must carry identification at all times. Carry a photocopy of your passport bio-data page and Thai visa or entry stamp.

Police may still require that you produce the original document. If you fail to do so, you could be detained.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs, including cannabis, are very severe. Convicted offenders can expect heavy fines, jail sentences or even the death penalty.

Police regularly perform spot checks to search for illegal drugs, particularly in and around entertainment venues. Uniformed or undercover police may conduct physical searches and may screen your belongings. You may be asked to provide a urine sample.

If you carry prescription drugs or other medicines, keep them in clearly marked, original packaging.

Certain prescription drugs are frequently sold without prescription in entertainment areas and coastal resorts, including on the street. You should never buy controlled drugs without prescription or on the street. These may be counterfeit or could contain illegal substances. If you purchase these drugs, you could be subject to scrutiny or detained.

#### Alcohol

The legal drinking age in Thailand is 20.

It is illegal to promote the consumption of alcohol. You could be fined or taken to court for posting on social media any pictures that include alcoholic beverages or people consuming alcohol.

### Smoking

It is prohibited to import, possess or use e-cigarettes, vaporisers, e-baraku (e-hashish) and their refills. Convicted offenders can expect heavy fines or jail sentences of up to 10 years.

A smoking ban is in effect on several beaches across the country and is punishable by a 100,000-baht fine and up to 1 year in prison.

Check with local authorities and look for no-smoking signs before smoking on a beach.

### Gambling

Gambling, with some exceptions, is illegal.

### Lèse-majesté

Actions or words that are considered offensive or insulting to the king or the royal family are illegal and may result in criminal prosecution and lengthy prison sentences.

Don’t make any public statement, including online, that could be perceived as critical of:

* the monarchy
* the political situation in Thailand
* the Royal Thai Army

You must be at least 18 years old to drive a car in Thailand.

It is illegal to operate a motorcycle without a valid Thai motorcycle licence or an international driving permit with a motorcycle endorsement.

### Housing foreign citizens

All hosts, including hotel staff and homeowners, must notify local authorities that they are housing foreign citizens within 24 hours of the arrival of these foreigners.

### Commercial surrogacy

Commercial surrogacy is illegal in Thailand.

If you’re planning to visit Thailand for the purpose of commissioning surrogacy arrangements, you should consider the potential challenges involved in pursuing international surrogacy and seek specialist legal advice on Thai and Canadian laws prior to making any arrangements.

It is also recommended that you consult with Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) on current policies regarding citizenship through descent and the issuance of Canadian travel documents.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Thailand.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of Thailand, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

### Compulsory military service

Male Thai citizens are subject to compulsory military service when they reach the age of 21. If you’re a dual Canadian–Thai citizen, you may be subject to this requirement.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Thailand.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Thailand by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Thailand to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.
