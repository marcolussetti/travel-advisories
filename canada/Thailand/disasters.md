### Monsoon

The rainy (or monsoon) season extends from June to October. Seasonal flooding can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable and bridges damaged.

### Air pollution

Air pollution fluctuates greatly and can be hazardous in urban areas, including Bangkok and Chiang Mai. Seasonal smog during the dry season is recurrent. In the northern provinces, including Chiang Mai, air quality can also be affected by agricultural burning.

You should monitor air pollution levels, especially if you suffer from respiratory ailments or if you have a pre-existing medical condition.

Local authorities recommend that children, seniors and pregnant women wear anti-pollution masks, and minimize outdoor activities, when air pollution levels are high.
