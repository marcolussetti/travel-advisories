## Natural disasters and climate

### Flooding in southern Thailand

Heavy rainfall has caused severe flooding across southern provinces of Thailand, including:

* Songkhla
* Pattani
* Yala
* Narathiwat

Recent monsoon rains have resulted in transportation disruptions and damage to infrastructure. Rising water levels have cut access to major roads, including those to the Hat Yai airport.

Local authorities have declared Hat Yai district a disaster zone. Evacuation orders are in effect. If you are in Hat Yai district, you should go to one of the following evacuation centres if you can do so safely:

* the Prince of Songkla University International Convention Center
* the Songkhla Rajabhat University auditorium
* the Royal Thai Navy’s Naval Area Command 2

If you are in an affected area:

* monitor local news and weather reports
* confirm your flight before going to the airport
* follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation and curfew orders

### Climate change

Climate change is affecting Thailand. Extreme and unusual weather events are becoming more frequent and may affect your travel plans. Monitor local media for the latest information.

### Typhoons and monsoons

Typhoons usually occur from April to November. During this period, even small tropical storms can quickly develop into major typhoons.

The rainy (or monsoon) season extends from June to November. Seasonal flooding can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable and bridges damaged.

Jungle treks are not advisable during the rainy season due to the possibility of mudslides. Flash flooding in caves has caused fatalities.

### Air pollution

Air pollution fluctuates greatly and can be hazardous in urban areas, including Bangkok and Chiang Mai. Seasonal smog during the dry season is recurrent. In the northern provinces, including Chiang Mai, air quality can also be affected by agricultural burning.

You should monitor air pollution levels, especially if you suffer from respiratory ailments or if you have a pre-existing medical condition.

Local authorities recommend that children, seniors and pregnant women wear anti-pollution masks, and minimize outdoor activities, when air pollution levels are high.
