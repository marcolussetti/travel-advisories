## Safety and security

### Tensions along the Thailand-Cambodia border

Tensions have increased along the Thailand-Cambodia border since an exchange of fire on May 28, 2025.

Thai and Cambodian authorities reached a ceasefire agreement on July 28, 2025, after five consecutive days of armed conflict along the border, with multiple casualties on both sides. The security environment remains volatile at the border due to a longstanding border dispute in the region.

On July 25, 2025, Thai authorities declared martial law in several districts along the border with Cambodia. When martial law is in effect, local authorities have enhanced powers and may impose security measures such as curfews and other movement restrictions. Martial law is in effect in the following districts of Chanthaburi and Trat provinces:

* Chanthaburi:

+ Mueang Chanthaburi
+ Tha Mai
+ Makham
+ Laem Sing
+ Kaeng Hang Maew
+ Na Yai Am
+ Khao Khitchakut

* Trat:

+ Khao Saming

Land mines are present in the disputed border regions. Land border crossings between Thailand and Cambodia may be closed or change their hours of operation unexpectedly.

Cross at designated border crossing points only, with the required travel documentation.

* Expect an increased military presence and vigilance
* Follow the instructions of local authorities, including curfews and evacuation orders
* Exercise increased caution if you are travelling to any areas along the border with Cambodia

### Southern provinces of Narathiwat, Pattani, Songkhla and Yala

Separatist insurgents periodically perpetrate criminally and politically motivated attacks in the southernmost provinces of Narathiwat, Pattani, Songkhla and Yala.

These deadly attacks include shootings, bombings and arson, and are usually directed at military, government and security buildings and personnel. They have also occurred in a variety of public places.

These groups may also target popular tourist areas throughout Thailand.

Martial law and heavily enhanced security measures are in place in Narathiwat, Pattani, and Yala provinces, and the Chana, Na Thawi, Thepha and Saba Yoi districts of Songkhla province.

Increased enforcement powers allow authorities to:

* detain suspects without charge
* conduct searches
* seize objects or documents
* impose curfews

You risk becoming a collateral victim of an attack if you travel in these provinces.

### Myanmar border areas in the provinces of Mae Hong Son and Tak

Exercise a high degree of caution when travelling to the Thailand-Myanmar border areas in the provinces of Mae Hong Son and Tak.

Occasional violence, banditry and clashes between government forces and drug traffickers occur.

Border crossing points may be closed without notice. Cross at designated border crossing points only, with the required travel documentation.

### Political tensions

Political instability in Thailand has created a volatile and unpredictable security environment throughout the country, particularly in Bangkok.

Legal provisions may allow the military to retain and exercise sweeping powers that could include the right to:

* prevent public gatherings
* censor media
* impose curfews
* set up checkpoints
* restrict movement
* search for weapons
* exercise force in response to violence

Such measures could be enforced at any time. Some television, radio stations and web sites may be unavailable, and access to social media services may be intermittently suspended.

### Terrorism

There is an ongoing threat of terrorism in Thailand. Thai authorities have defused devices in Phuket, Krabi and Phang Nga in June 2025. Small-scale bomb attacks have occurred in public places.Â Further attacks are possible.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

### Demonstrations

Large demonstrations occur regularly in Bangkok and across the country. They are often related to social and political tensions, and are expected to continue.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also disrupt traffic and public transportation when they block major roads and intersections and may cause the closure of mass transit stations.

Maintain a high level of personal security awareness at all times.

Demonstration sites in Bangkok include:

* the areas around the Victory Monument
* Thammasat University
* the Bangkok Arts and Cultural Centre
* the Democracy Monument
* Ratchaprasong intersection

Other areas of the city may also be affected by protests and associated movements. Demonstrations have also taken place in other cities.

* Avoid military installations and concentrations of security personnel
* Expect a heightened security presence in several areas
* Carry identification documents at all time
* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Crime

Petty crime, such as purse snatching, pickpocketing and theft, is common. Thieves sometimes use razors to cut purses and bags open to remove their contents.

* Don't leave bags unattended
* Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and travel documents, are secure at all times, especially in tourist areas, crowded markets and bus or train stations
* Avoid walking in dark alleys or isolated areas

Thefts occur on cross-country buses and vans. Personal belongings, including passports, have been stolen from luggage compartments under buses, especially on long-distance journeys. Use only reputable transportation companies.

Break-ins occur at budget guesthouses, sometimes while guests are asleep in their rooms.

Be careful at night in entertainment areas throughout the country, including in Koh Pha Ngan and Koh Tao, particularly during full moon parties, Songkran, and other events in popular tourist locations. Robberies and assaults (including sexual assaults) can occur during these events. Passport thefts and losses are common.

Violent crime against foreigners occurs occasionally.

You should report all criminal incidents to the Thai police in the jurisdiction where the incident occurred before leaving Thailand.

### Fraud

There is a rise in cases where foreigners have been lured to Thailand with promises of high-paying jobs, only to be kidnapped and forced to work for scams or trafficked into neighbouring countries.

Many Canadians fall victim to a variety of scams while visiting Thailand. Always verify a job offer through official channels. You should report all incidents to the tourist police.

#### Credit card and ATM fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud occurs. Be cautious when using debit or credit cards:

* pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others
* use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

#### Rental scams

Rental companies have at times accused renters of causing damage upon return of the equipment. In some cases, renters who refused to pay were harassed and threatened, and their passports (left as collateral) were withheld. Some companies have also stolen the motorcycle and then claimed compensation from the renter.

Before renting a motorcycle or personal watercraft, read all rental contracts thoroughly to ensure that the vehicle is insured to cover damage and theft. Take photos of existing damage on rented vehicles as proof of pre-existing damage.

You must never use your Canadian passport as collateral for rental. If your passport is inaccessible or stolen because of such a situation, you may be subject to investigation by Passport Canada and may receive limited passport services.

Only rent from reputable companies.

#### Entertainment venues

Some bars, nightclubs and entertainment venues may try to charge exorbitant prices. Discussions about overcharging may lead to threats of violence.

* Confirm the prices before consumption
* Avoid running a tab
* Avoid leaving your credit card with bar or restaurant staff

#### Travel agencies

When dealing with travel agencies, ensure that the company is a reputable tour organization before providing payment.

#### Investment fraud

If you plan on buying property or making other investments in Thailand seek legal advice in Canada and Thailand. Do so before making commitments. Related disputes could take time and be costly to resolve.

#### Gems and jewellery purchases

In scams involving gems and jewellery, merchants sell lower-quality items at inflated prices with promises that the items can be resold at a profit. The guarantees that merchants offer are not always honoured.

Carefully consider all purchases if you are not knowledgeable about gems and jewellery. The Government of Canada cannot assist in obtaining refunds for purchases made.

### Spiked food and drinks

Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

Seek immediate medical attention if you suspect that you have been drugged.

### Women's safety

Sexual assaults against foreign women have occurred. Be particularly vigilant during full moon parties, Songkran, and other events in popular tourist locations.

If you are victim of a sexual assault, you should seek medical attention and report the situation immediately to local authorities and the nearest Canadian office.

### Water activities

Deaths have occurred due to contact with poisonous jellyfish off Koh Lanta, Koh Pha Ngan, Koh Phi Phi, Krabi and Phuket.

Riptides in coastal areas can be strong, including in the popular destinations of Cha-am/Hua Hin, Koh Samui, Pattaya, Phuket and Rayong. There have been several deaths due to drowning.

Diving schools and rescue services may not adhere to international standards.

* Rent water sports equipment only from operators affiliated with major international training organizations
* Exercise extreme caution when swimming or practising water activities
* Heed flag warnings and don't swim when a red flag is displayed
* If stung by a jellyfish, seek immediate medical assistance

### Adventure tourism

If you undertake adventure sports, such as zip-lining, rock climbing, speleology, elephant trekking or parasailing, choose a well-established and reputable company that has insurance.

Tour operators may not adhere to international standards. If you have any doubt concerning the safety of the installation or equipment, don't use them. Ensure that your travel insurance covers the recreational activities you choose.

If engaging in adventure tourism:

* never do so alone
* always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* don't venture off marked trails
* ensure that you're properly equipped
* ensure that you're well informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary
* obtain detailed information on each activity before setting out

### Chemical pesticide poisoning

There have been cases of poisoning linked to the use of chemical pesticides, including phosphine. Seek immediate medical assistance if you believe that you have been exposed to a chemical pesticide and are experiencing unusual symptoms.

Seek information on whether or not chemical pesticides are used in your accommodations.

### Road safety

Accidents involving vehicles and pedestrians are extremely frequent in Thailand.

Hazardous road conditions, adverse weather conditions, local disregard for traffic laws and drunk driving result in frequent accidents.

Some vehicles may drive against the flow of traffic and on the sidewalks, particularly motorcycles.

Drunk driving and accidents are much more frequent around the western New Year (January 1) and Thai New Year (Songkran, mid-April). Be particularly vigilant when driving during these holiday periods.

Slow-moving trucks limit speed and visibility. Avoid driving on mountain roads at night, especially during the rainy season (June to October). Paved roads connect major cities, but most have only two lanes. Some roads can become impassable, particularly during the rainy season.

Pedestrians and cyclists should be particularly careful. You should always use elevated walkways/pedestrian bridges whenever possible, especially in Bangkok.

#### Motorcycles

Motorcycle accidents are common and are responsible for the majority of road deaths. Rental scooters and motorcycles are often poorly maintained, making them unsafe to their riders and others on the road.

Helmets are mandatory for motorcycle riders (including passengers), but many helmets don't meet international safety standards.

Insurance claims could be denied if you were driving without a motorcycle licence.

Avoid driving or riding motorcycles in Thailand, even if you are an experienced motorcyclist

### Public transportation

#### Taxis

Use licensed taxis from official taxi stands, limousine services or a trusted ride-sharing app.

If arriving by air, arrange to be picked up by hotel shuttle services, use a trusted ride-sharing app, the airport rail-link service or official airport buses.

Unlicensed vehicles (bearing black and white licence plates) are not correctly insured to carry passengers and may not use meters. Many taxis may not be equipped with backseat seatbelts.

Don't share a taxi with strangers.

Disputes with taxis operators, tuk-tuks (motorized rickshaws), etc., occur and have occasionally resulted in violence or intimidation. Should a dispute occur and you feel threatened, seek local police's assistance to settle the matter.

#### Marine transportation

Passenger boats accidents have occurred due to overloading and poor maintenance of some vessels. Vessels often lack adequate safety equipment.

Don't board vessels that appear overloaded or unseaworthy.

#### Trains

In the past, rail lines in the far south have been the targets of sabotage and armed attacks.

Train accidents in recent years have caused injuries and deaths.

### Piracy

Pirate attacks and armed robbery against ships occur in coastal waters. Mariners should take appropriate precautions.
