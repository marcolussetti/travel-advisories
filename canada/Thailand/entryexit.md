# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Thai authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you use for travel.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid at least 6 months upon entry into Thailand.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Visas

Tourist visa: not required for stays of up to 60 days   
Business visa: not required for stays of up to 60 days  
Student visa: required   
Working visa: required

If you're travelling to Thailand for tourism with a regular Canadian passport, you can obtain a 60-day visa exemption on arrival (no visa required), which can be extended at the Immigration Office for another 30 days maximum at the discretion of the immigration officer.

If you have a Multiple Entry Tourist Visa (METV), you can enter Thailand multiple times during the 6-month period of validity, however each visit must be 60 days or less. The METV visa must be obtained before travelling.

A Destination Thailand Visa (DTV) is valid for five years. This visa allows the holder, their spouse and dependant children, to multiple entries with each stay not exceeding 180 days.

After the initial maximum stay of 180 days, you will have to leave and re-enter Thailand with the same DTV before it expires. DTVs are issued to remote workers, as well as participants of Muay Thai courses, Thai cooking classes, sports training, medical treatments, seminars, and music festivals.

DTV-holders are not permitted to work for Thai companies.

If you wish to stay longer than 60 days or work or study in Thailand, you must obtain the appropriate visa directly from a Thai embassy or consulate. Please beware of visa intermediaries, visa agents, or visa agencies. Local authorities are actively monitoring and enforcing compliance with visa regulations.

Those applying for non-immigrant visas of category "O-A" need to show proof of a valid health insurance meeting specific criteria.

### Other entry requirements

Thai Border officials may ask you to show them a return or onward ticket and proof that you have sufficient funds to support yourself for the duration of your stay.

If you are unable to do so, you may be denied entry.

### Entry stamp

You must get an entry stamp from an immigration officer at the point of entry into Thailand. Don't get your visa, visa extension or entry stamp from visa shops or travel agents in Thailand.

A passport that has been altered or that contains counterfeit visas, and entry/exit stamps is deemed invalid. Offenders can expect jail sentences, fines and deportation, and may also be prohibited from entering Thailand in the future.

### Length of stay

The date indicated on your Thai entry stamp determines how long you may stay in the country, even if your visa shows a different date.

All foreigners staying in Thailand longer than 3 months must notify Thailand's immigration bureau of their residence every 90 days.

The Royal Thai Police perform random visa checks and strict penalties are enforced for overstaying. Canadians overstaying their visa have been arrested and detained until deportation. Deportation procedures are at the foreigner's own expense and can be lengthy. Detention conditions in immigration detention centres are poor.

If you overstay, regardless of whether you leave Thailand voluntarily or are deported, you may be banned from re-entering Thailand for 1 to 10 years.
