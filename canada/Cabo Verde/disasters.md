## Natural disasters and climate

The climate is dry and windy.

Cabo Verde is very hot and receives little rain throughout the year.

The rainy season usually occurs from August to October, but there has been a severe drought for several years. Fogo receives more rain than the other islands.

Natural disasters are possible due to regional volcanic activity. Follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders, and monitor local media reports.
