### Road safety

Main roads are usually paved with cobblestones but can be narrow, winding and poorly lit.

Drivers and pedestrians should exercise caution, particularly after dark. Organized roadside assistance is not widely available.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations can occur.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Swimming

Strong currents and powerful waves make swimming and water sports dangerous at some locations. Drownings occur every year, especially in Praia. Be vigilant on beaches and never swim alone.

### Tourism infrastructure

Tourism infrastructure, including hotels, restaurants and transportation networks, is limited outside big cities

If you are planning to travel to remote areas:

* keep a supply of water, food, fuel and an emergency kit on hand
* bring a cell phone, charger and local emergency numbers
* only use reputable tour operators

### Maritime transportation

Sea conditions can be treacherous.

Mariners should seek local advice prior to travel, particularly to the islands of Brava and Fogo. Advise local ports of arrival and departure times and provide relatives with your itinerary.

### Public transportation

Intercity van service can be hazardous due to the bad driving habits of local residents.

Taxis hailed from hotels are generally reliable.

In Praia, city buses and taxis are reliable, clean and in good condition.

### Air travel

We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.
