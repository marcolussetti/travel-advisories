## Safety and security

### Crime

Crime occurs across the country. Certain towns and areas experience higher levels of crime than others, particularly on the following islands:

* Santiago, especially in Praia and Fazenda
* Sal
* Maio
* Boa Vista

Many public areas in towns and cities are poorly lit at night. Avoid travelling alone at night and always be aware of your surroundings in poorly lit or isolated areas.

Hillside staircases connect neighbourhoods in many towns, including Praia. Criminals use these staircases to prey on isolated individuals. Avoid using hillside staircases alone or at night.

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and bag snatching, occurs frequently. Thieves target tourists and usually steal cell phones and camera equipment.

Theft notably occurs in crowded public areas such as:

* festivals and street fairs
* beaches
* hillside staircases connecting neighbourhoods
* outdoor markets, especially:
  + on the island of São Vicente, including in Mindelo
  + on the island of Santiago, including in Praia

During your trip:

* keep your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, in a secure place
* avoid showing signs of affluence or wearing expensive jewellery
* do not carry large sums of cash or valuables unnecessarily
* avoid deserted areas at night
* be aware of your surroundings, especially in busy tourist areas

Thieves, including children, sometimes work in groups. They may try to distract you and take your attention away from your valuables or belongings.

#### Violent crime

Violent crime occurs frequently, especially at night and in isolated areas.

Incidents include:

If you’re the victim of a sexual assault, you should report it immediately to the nearest Government of Canada office.

During your stay:

* travel in groups
* pay attention to people walking behind you
* do not resist an attack
* be careful at night, never go out alone and bring a flashlight with you

Demonstrations may occur.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

### Adventure tourism

Outdoor activities, such as hiking, can be dangerous. The trail to the summit of the Pico Grande volcano, on the island of Fogo, requires a very good physical condition and is not suitable for children.

If you intend to participate in adventure tourism activities:

* share your itinerary with a friend or family member if you’re alone
* stay on marked trails and consider hiring an experienced guide from a reputable company
* obtain detailed information on your activity and the environment in which you will be setting out
* buy travel insurance that covers incidents related to these types of recreational activities
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to tackle the challenges of your activity
* ensure that you have proper equipment and bring sufficient water
* monitor weather conditions and other possible hazards

### Water activities

You should be cautious of very strong wind currents, tides, and powerful waves if you intend to participate in water activities such as sailing, surfing and paddleboarding.

#### Swimming

Strong currents and powerful waves make swimming and water sports dangerous in some locations. Several drownings occur every year, especially in Praia and on the island of Sal.

* Be vigilant on beaches and never swim alone
* Respect the areas reserved for swimming
* Always maintain a safe distance from boats and restricted areas
* Always respect warning flags advising of dangerous conditions
* Avoid beaches and coastal areas if the weather forecast is poor
* Follow the instructions of local authorities

### Power outages

Power outages occur regularly. They could impact essential services, such as:

* public transportation, including flights
* medical services
* the public water supply
* telecommunications
* banking transactions
* the supply of basic necessities

Not all buildings are equipped with generators.

* Keep a supply of water, food and fuel and an emergency kit on hand
* Monitor local media for the latest information

### Roads

#### Road safety

Road safety may vary considerably across the country.

#### Road conditions

Roads on the islands are narrow and usually paved with cobblestones.

While most main roads have streetlights, they are often affected by power outages.

Driving can also be dangerous due to:

* unpaved roads
* poorly maintained roads
* stray livestock
* narrow, winding and mountainous roads

Driving conditions may be hazardous during the rainy season, with certain roads quickly becoming slippery and muddy. Rockslides could occur. Heavy rainfall can also move vehicles, destroy road sections and wash out bridges.

#### ​Driving habits

Drivers usually respect traffic laws but can be aggressive and reckless. They will often park vehicles in the middle of the road, blocking traffic.

Drinking and driving is common. You should be particularly cautious of drunk driving on Sundays and during holidays.

There is no emergency roadside assistance.

If you choose to drive:

* plan your trip in advance, especially if you are visiting a rural area
* avoid travelling after dark
* always keep doors and windows closed and locked
* always carry a cell phone and a charger
* keep a list of emergency numbers on hand
* inform a friend or family member of your itinerary

### Public transportation

Public transportation services, including buses and commuter vans, are unreliable. Accidents are common.

#### Taxis

Taxi availability may be limited, especially late at night or outside city centres. Officially registered taxis are tan or cream colour, except on the islands of Sal and Boa Vista, where they are blue and yellow.

* Only use officially marked taxis
* Only use reputable taxi companies through establishments such as hotels
* Confirm the driver's identity and licence plate before getting into the car
* Make sure the driver does not pick up other passengers on the way to your destination
* Never share a taxi with strangers

### Maritime transportation

Sea conditions can be dangerous.

* Seek advice from locals prior to travel, particularly if you plan to sail to the islands of Brava and Fogo
* Advise local ports of your arrival and departure times
* Inform a friend or family member of your itinerary before you leave
