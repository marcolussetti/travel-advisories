## Safety and security

### Landmines

Unmarked landmines and unexploded ordnance continue to pose a risk, particularly in isolated mountainous areas and in the countryside.

* Stay on main roads and paved surfaces
* Avoid abandoned houses and buildings
* Travel only during daylight hours
* Do not touch war relics and unknown items. Report these to local authorities

### Crime

#### Petty Crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs, particularly in large urban centres such as Sarajevo, Banja Luka, Tuzla and Mostar. Criminals often target foreigners in crowded tourist areas and on public transportation.

Home and vehicle break-ins are common, particularly in Sarajevo and on Trebevic mountain. Foreigners have been targeted by thieves in Trebević.

* Ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Avoid showing signs of affluence, such as jewellery, and carrying large sums of cash
* Avoid isolated and poorly lit areas after dark

#### Violent Crime

Organized crime is prevalent in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Random acts of armed violence occur as a result, particularly in Sarajevo. Though foreigners are rarely targeted, they are advised to exercise caution as there is a risk of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, such as in nightclubs and cafés late at night and in the early morning hours.

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism. Terrorist attacks could occur at any time.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations may occur. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Road safety

Bosnia and Herzegovina has a disproportionately high rate of death and injury due to motor vehicle accidents.

Road conditions and road safety can vary greatly throughout the country. Poorly lit roads and poorly maintained vehicles pose a risk to tourists.

Drivers do not respect traffic laws and are known to speed. Drinking and driving is prevalent.

Extreme weather conditions, such as dense fog, excess snow and black ice also pose risks. During the winter months, many roads are particularly hazardous, particularly secondary roads and mountain roads which may be blocked by landslides. During the summer, traffic is frequently stopped to enable landmine clearance and road repairs.

Many secondary roads have no service stations.

* Undertake travel on secondary roads only with a vehicle in excellent mechanical condition
* Ensure that you have sufficient fuel, food and water supplies

### Public transportation

Exercise increased caution on public transportation due to pickpockets and those posing as ticket controllers.

#### Buses

Local tram and bus services are reliable. Inter-city bus services are also widely available.

#### Trains

Local and inter-city rail lines are reliable.

Lock compartment doors from the inside when travelling on an overnight train.

#### Taxis

Taxi service is available in most towns and for inter-city travel.

* Use only registered taxis whose license plates begin with “TA”
* To avoid being overcharged, make sure the driver turns on the meter
