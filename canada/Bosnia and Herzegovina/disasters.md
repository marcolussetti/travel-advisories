## Natural disasters and climate

### Flooding and landslides

Severe flooding in the spring or after heavy rains can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services. RoadsÂ and bridges may become impassable.

Flooding and landslides in October 2024 caused significant damage in the centre of the country, particularly near the town of Jablanica. Certain rail lines and roads remain closed.

There is a risk year-round.

* Exercise caution, particularly in areas around major rivers
* Stay informed of the latest regional weather forecasts
* Follow the advice of local authorities, including evacuation orders

### Earthquakes

Bosnia and Herzegovina is in an active seismic zone, and minor earthquakes are common.

### Wildfires

Bush and forest fires are common in the summer, but are generally contained within inaccessible areas.

The air quality in areas near active fires may deteriorate due to heavy smoke. In case of a major fire:

* stay away from the affected area, particularly if you suffer from respiratory ailments
* follow the instructions of local emergency services personnel
* monitor local media for up-to-date information on the situation
