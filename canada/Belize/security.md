### Southside Belize City

Gang violence is a significant concern in Belize, especially in Southside Belize City. Gang members often use weapons to resolve disputes. Clashes occur frequently between gangs to gain control over territories for illegal activities.

Police capacity to respond to violent incidents is limited, and many crimes remain unsolved.

Tourists are not usually targeted, but you could find yourself in the wrong place at the wrong time.

### Crime

#### Violent crime

Violent crime is also a major concern elsewhere in the country, including in Belmopan. Belize has one of the highest per capita murder rates in the world.

Drug and human trafficking, organized crime and street gang activity is prevalent. Violent incidents are frequent, including:

* murders
* armed robberies
* home invasions
* muggings
* sexual assaults

There has been an increase in the number of violent incidents against foreign national residents, including home break-ins and physical assaults.

Border areas often see higher criminal activity and violence. Criminals are active around the border with Guatemala, close to tourist sites such as the Mayan ruins at Caracol.

To avoid becoming the victim of a crime:

* remain aware of your surroundings at all times
* avoid travelling after dark
* maintain a charge in your cellphone
* if you are threatened, hand over your cash and valuables without resistance

#### Petty crime

### Adventure tourism

Outdoor activities, such as snorkelling, diving, zip-lining, canopy touring, hiking, mountain biking and other adventure activities can be dangerous if unprepared. Trails are not always marked, and weather conditions can change rapidly, even in the summer.

If you intend to practice adventure tourism:

* never do so alone, and don’t part with your expedition companions
* obtain detailed information on your activity and on the environment in which you will be before setting out
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* avoid venturing off marked trails
* ensure that you’re adequately equipped and bring sufficient water
* stay informed of weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* refrain from using equipment if you have doubts on the safety
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary

### Road travel

Road conditions and road safety are poor throughout the country. Accidents are common.

#### Road conditions

Besides George Price and Philip Goldson highways, most roads are unpaved. Bridges often face severe flooding after a storm. Driving conditions may be hazardous, especially during the rainy season, due to:

* potholes
* inadequate lighting
* narrow or unpaved roads
* lack of guardrails
* lack of traffic signs
* roaming livestock

#### Road safety

Drivers don’t respect traffic laws. They may be reckless.

There are many bicycles in urban areas. Most of the time, cyclists don’t respect traffic laws either. They contribute to the chaotic situation by posing further traffic hazards.

There is no emergency road assistance. Service stations are scarce, and they are often closed for holidays.

If driving in Belize:

* familiarize yourself with your route before starting the trip
* avoid travelling after dark, especially on rural roads
* keep your windows and doors locked at all times
* keep your belongings out of reach and sight
* never leave belongings unattended in a vehicle, even in the trunk
* don’t stop to change a flat tire in an isolated area and be aware of strangers offering their help
* don’t stop to offer road-side assistance to others
* inquire about insurance coverage options for roadside assistance when renting a car
* always keep your gas tank full when in remote areas
* advise a relative of your anticipated itinerary and route

### Public transportation

#### Buses

Public buses are not commonly used in Belize. Bus services are available to travel between cities but are not reliable. Vehicles lack maintenance and safety equipment.

Avoid travelling by bus.

#### Taxis

Taxis are not safe. You should refrain from using them.

Registered taxis are identifiable by their green licence plates. Private vehicles have white licence plates. Both may not have a meter.

Popular ride-sharing apps are not available in Belize.

If you must use a taxi:

* never board taxis at taxi stands or flag taxis on the street
* note the driver’s name and plate number
* never share a taxi with strangers
* negotiate the fare before getting in the vehicle

#### Ferries

Water taxis are the main way to travel between the cayes, the Belize Barrier Reef and the mainland.

If you choose to travel by ferry:

* make sure the vessel you are boarding is carrying appropriate safety equipment
* make sure that life jackets are always provided for all passengers and are accessible
* avoid boarding vessels that appear overloaded or unseaworthy
* verify the safety standards of ferries with your tour operator
* ensure your belongings are properly closed and locked
