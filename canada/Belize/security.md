## Safety and security

### Southside Belize City

Gang violence is a significant concern in Belize, especially in Southside Belize City. Gang members often use weapons to resolve disputes. Clashes occur frequently between gangs to gain control over territories for illegal activities.

Police capacity to respond to violent incidents is limited, and many crimes remain unsolved.

Tourists are not usually targeted, but you could be in the wrong place at the wrong time.

### Crime

#### Violent crime

Violent crime is also a major concern elsewhere in the country, including in the capital, Belmopan. Belize has one of the highest per-capita murder rates in the world.

Drug and human trafficking, organized crime and street gang activity is prevalent. Violent crime occurs frequently. Incidents include:

* murders
* armed robberies
* burglaries
* assaults, including sexual assaults

Violent incidents against foreign national residents occur, including burglaries and physical assaults. These incidents sometimes occur in popular tourist areas such as:

* Caye Caulker

During your stay:

If you cross a land border:

### Roads

#### Road safety
