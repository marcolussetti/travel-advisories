## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Transfer to a Canadian prison

Canada and Belize accede the Inter-American Convention on Serving Criminal Sentences abroad. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in Belize to request a transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both Canadian and Belizean authorities. This process can take a long time, and there is no guarantee that the transfer will be approved by either or both sides.

The legal system is cumbersome and not always transparent. If you are arrested in Belize, even for a minor incident, you should expect lengthy delays to resolve your case and you may not be allowed to leave the country.

### Death penalty

Belizean authorities may apply the death penalty for the offence of murder.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect lengthy jail sentences or heavy fines.

Belize is a transit point for illegal drugs between South and North America.

* Pack your own luggage and monitor it closely at all times
* Never transport other people’s packages, bags or suitcases

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Belize.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Belize, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Belizean court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Belize to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.
