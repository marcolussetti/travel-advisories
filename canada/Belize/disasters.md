## Natural disasters and climate

### Hurricane season

Hurricanes usually occur from mid-May to the end of November. During this period, even small tropical storms can quickly develop into major hurricanes.

These severe storms can put you at risk and hamper the provision of essential services. You could face serious safety risks during a hurricane.

If you decide to travel to a coastal area during the hurricane season despite the risks:

* be prepared to change your travel plans on short notice, including cutting short or cancelling your trip
* stay informed of the latest regional weather forecasts
* carry emergency contact information for your airline or tour operator
* follow the advice and instructions of local authorities

### Rainy season

The rainy season extends from May to November.

Seasonal flooding can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable due to landslides and mudslides. Infrastructure may be damaged.

### Wildfires

Bush and forest fires are common between December and May, particularly in the Cayo District and in southern districts of Belize. Heavy smoke may deteriorate the air quality in areas near active fires.

In case of a major fire:

* stay away from the affected areas, particularly if you suffer from respiratory ailments
* monitor local media for the latest information
* follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders
