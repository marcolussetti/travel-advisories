## Natural disasters and climate

### Hurricane season

Hurricanes usually occur from mid-May to the end of November. During this period, even small tropical storms can quickly develop into major hurricanes.

These severe storms can put you at risk and hamper the provision of essential services. You could face serious safety risks during a hurricane.

If you decide to travel to a coastal area during the hurricane season:

* be prepared to change your travel plans on short notice, including cutting short or cancelling your trip
* stay informed of the latest regional weather forecasts
* carry emergency contact information for your airline or tour operator
* follow the advice and instructions of local authorities

### Rainy Season

The rainy season extends from May to November.

Seasonal flooding can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable, and bridges may be damaged. Heavy rains may also contribute to dangerous landslides.

### Wildfires

Bush and forest fires are common between December and May, particularly in the Cayo District and in southern districts of Belize. The air quality in areas near active fires may deteriorate due to heavy smoke.

In case of a major fire:

* stay away from the affected area, particularly if you suffer from respiratory ailments
* follow the instructions of local emergency services personnel
* monitor local media for up-to-date information on the situation
