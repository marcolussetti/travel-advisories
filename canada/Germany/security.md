# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and bag snatching, occurs.

Organized groups of pickpockets often use distraction techniques and are particularly active in:

* major cities
* transportation hubs
* public transportation
* Christmas markets
* tourist attractions

There is a significant increase in stolen passports on trains, particularly during the summer and winter holiday season.

Ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times.

#### Violent crime

Violent crime is uncommon, but does occur.

Crimes committed by far-right extremists against individuals belonging to ethnic, religious or political minorities occur.

While tourists are not specifically targeted, you could find yourself in the wrong place at the wrong time. Violent crimes like knife and car-ramming attacks have occurred in crowded places, such as commercial districts and transit centres.

Always be vigilant and aware of your surroundings.

#### Cybercrime

Cybercrime occurs. Perpetrators may compromise public Wi-Fi networks to steal credit card or personal information.

* Avoid using unsecured public Wi-Fi networks
* Avoid making purchases on unencrypted websites
* Be cautious when posting information on social media
* Be particularly vigilant when contacting or meeting individuals known over the internet

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in Europe. Terrorists have carried out attacks in several European cities.

Terrorist attacks could occur at any time. Over the past few years, several attacks have occurred in Germany. These have resulted in many injuries and deaths. Further attacks are likely.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, Christmas markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

The Government of Germany maintains a public alert system on terrorism. Alert level changes are communicated through local media.

* Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places
* Be particularly vigilant if attending sporting events and during religious holidays and other public celebrations, as terrorists have used such occasions to mount attacks

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Strikes

Strikes occur regularly, particularly in key sectors including aviation and ground transport. These strikes can sometimes complicate travel and disrupt services.

* Consult local media to be aware of strikes that may affect your stay or travel plans
* In the event of a transport strike, plan extra time to get to your destination

### Mountain activities

If you intend to go hiking, mountaineering or skiing:

* never do so alone and always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* ensure that you are properly equipped and well informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary, including when you expect to be back
* obtain detailed information on trekking routes or ski slopes before setting out and do not venture off marked trails or slopes
