# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

German authorities may conduct controls at all land border crossings until September 15, 2025. You may be asked to present your travel documents when you enter Germany from within the Schengen area.

[More information on temporary border controls](#controls)

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the German authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Entry/Exit System (EES)

The Entry/Exit System (EES) begins operations on October 12, 2025.

The EES is an automated registration system for travellers from countries outside the European Union or the Schengen area. You will be required to register through this system upon arrival at the border of any of the 29 countries in the Schengen area.

You won’t need to take any action before you travel. The EES will collect information about your trip as well as your facial image and fingerprints.

### Schengen area

Canadian citizens do not need a visa for travel to countries within the Schengen area. However, visa-free travel only applies to stays of up to 90 days in any 180-day period. Stays are cumulative and include visits to any Schengen area country.

If you plan to stay in the Schengen area for a longer period of time, you will need a visa. You must contact the high commission or embassy of the country or countries you are travelling to and obtain the appropriate visa(s) prior to travel.

### Temporary border controls

The German government has reintroduced internal border controls at certain border crossings. You may be required to pass through immigration controls when entering Germany, even if arriving from another Schengen area country.

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 3 months beyond the date you expect to leave the Schengen area.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Extension of stay

You are allowed to stay in the Schengen area for 90 days in a 180-day period. After this, you can stay in Germany for another 90 days if you meet these conditions:

* you leave Germany and re-enter from any country outside of the Schengen area
* you have your passport stamped at the border with the date of your return to Germany
* you will not travel to other Schengen area countries during the second 90-day period
* you don’t work in Germany

If you unexpectedly have to stay beyond the limit, contact the Foreigners’ Registration Office (Ausländerbehörde) in the district you are staying in to regularize your extended stay.

### Registration

If you intend to reside in Germany for more than 3 months, you must register at the local Residents‘ Registration Office (Einwohnermeldeamt), usually within 7 days of your entry into the country.

If you don’t, you may be fined.

This does not apply to travellers staying in Germany as tourists.

### Other entry requirements

Customs officials may ask you to show them a return or onward ticket and proof of sufficient funds to cover your stay.
