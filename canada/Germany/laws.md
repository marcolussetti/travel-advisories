## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Transfer to a Canadian prison

Canada and Germany are signatories to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in Germany to request a transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both Canadian and Germany authorities.

This process can take a long time, and there is no guarantee that the transfer will be approved by either or both sides.

### Identification

Local police may ask to see your identification at any time.

* Carry adequate identification at all times, such as your passport or residence permit
* Keep a photocopy of your passport in a safe place, in case it is lost or stolen

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect jail sentences or heavy fines.

### Illegal activities

There are strict laws regarding the diffusion of propaganda material and the use of symbols from the Nazi party or other organizations linked to fascism and the Third Reich.

Illegal activities may include:

* diffusing or sharing propaganda, including online
* producing, importing or exporting memorabilia
* publicly wearing, using or display symbols and greetings related to these organizations

Convicted offenders can expect jail sentences or fines.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Germany.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Germany, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Germany.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Germany, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the German court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Germany to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

#### Speed limits

Speed limits vary considerably in Germany. On the highway network (autobahn), limits are generally much higher than the ones in Canada. On certain sections, there are no speed limits.

* Drive carefully
* Be mindful of speed regulations

#### Low-emission zones

Certain cities have put in place low-emission zones (Umweltzone) to reduce air pollution.

Access to these zones is restricted. You may need to obtain a permit to prove that your vehicle responds to environmental standards.

#### Personal light electric vehicles

Drivers of light electric vehicles, such as electric scooters and e-skateboards, must follow the rules of the road. Insurance is mandatory.

To drive such vehicles, your blood alcohol limit must not exceed 0.05%. New drivers and individuals under 21 years of age must not have any alcohol in their system. Convicted offenders can face heavy fines and have their licence confiscated on the spot. Authorities may ask for the fine to be paid right away.

You cannot drive on pedestrian walkways and in pedestrian zones.

### Money

The currency of Germany is the euro (EUR).

If you are carrying €10,000 or more, or the equivalent in other currencies or monetary instruments, you must make a declaration to customs when you enter or leave the European Union.

This does not apply if you are travelling within the European Union or in transit to a non-EU country.
