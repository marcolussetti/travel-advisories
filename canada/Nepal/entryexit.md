# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

The authorities of a country or territory decide who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Nepalese authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country's entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond the date you expect to leave Nepal.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

You should also be aware that current systems used by some countries and travel companies may not recognize the “X” gender identifier. You may still be asked to provide your sex/gender information as either male or female when travelling.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Visa overstays

Overstaying your visa is an offence and immigration authorities can detain you until you pay a fine. In addition to fines and detention, overstays can result in a 7-year ban on re-entry.

### Mandatory registration

All foreign nationals travelling to Nepal after September 16, 2025, must register upon arrival via the NepaliPort website or mobile app.

NepaliPort is a digital registration and tracking system. You will need to enter your personal information and details about your visa and travel plans.

All public and private service providers in Nepal are required to enroll in the program. You may need to scan QR codes or use authentication applications on your mobile when interacting with hotels, airlines and other businesses.
