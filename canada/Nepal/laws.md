### Dress and behaviour

Women should dress conservatively in public. Visitors to temples and other religious sites should not wear shorts or sleeveless tops.

Public displays of affection are considered inappropriate.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Nepalese law does not prohibit sexual acts between persons of the same sex.

However, Nepalese society remains fairly conservative. 2SLGBTQI+ persons could be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or sex characteristics.

### Proselytizing

It’s illegal to proselytize or convert people to another religion in Nepal.

### Commercial surrogacy

Commercial surrogacy services for foreigners are banned in Nepal. If you have already entered into such an arrangement, you should seek advice from a local lawyer on how this ban could affect your situation and on any exit requirement.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Nepal.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of Nepal, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Nepal.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Nepal by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Nepal to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Money

The currency of Nepal is the Nepalese rupee (NPR).

The economy is largely cash-based; however, credit cards can be used in major stores, hotels and restaurants. ATMs are available in larger cities such as Kathmandu and Pokhara.

Indian rupees (INR) are widely accepted in larger cities and tourist destinations. However, the use of notes greater than 100 INR is prohibited. If you plan to bring INR into the country, you should convert larger notes before arriving.

It is illegal to take NPR banknotes out of the country.

Any amount over US$5,000 in cash (or equivalent in foreign currencies) must be declared at customs upon arrival in Nepal.
