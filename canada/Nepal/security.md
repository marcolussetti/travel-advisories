# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Demonstrations in Nepal

In September 2025, violent clashes between demonstrators and security forces resulted in hundreds of casualties, including several deaths.

Although the situation in Nepal is currently calm, it is evolving and could deteriorate quickly. Curfews could be reinstated with little notice.

General elections are scheduled for March 5, 2026. Demonstrations may occur, especially before, during and after elections.

If you are in Nepal:

* avoid demonstrations and areas around government buildings, especially near the Nepali Parliament
* expect heavy security measures and an increased security presence in major cities
* monitor local media for the latest information
* follow the instructions of local authorities, including curfew orders

### Crime

Petty theft, such as pickpocketing and bag snatching, is common, particularly near tourist sites in airports and on crowded buses.

Take particular care when walking around Kupandol, Sanepa and Thamel, popular tourist spots in Kathmandu, where pickpocketing is common.

Theft also occurs from hotel rooms.

There has been a significant increase in crime, including thefts, bag snatchings, pickpocketing and break-ins, during the festival season, which extends from September to November.

Armed robberies, particularly of solo trekkers, occur occasionally.

During your trip:

* keep your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, in a secure place
* do not carry large sums of cash or valuables unnecessarily
* be aware of your surroundings, especially in busy tourist areas
* avoid going out after dark

### Women's safety

Women travelling alone are at higher risk of verbal or physical harassment. Sexual assaults have occurred, including against foreign women. Dress conservatively, particularly in remote areas.

### Spiked food, drinks and other items

Never leave your food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Avoid accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as these items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

### Political tensions and violence

While Nepal continues its transition to a stable democracy, the political situation remains fragile and tensions can increase with little notice.

Small-scale, politically motivated attacks occasionally occur, especially in Kathmandu. Past attacks, some using improvised explosive devices, have injured or killed people. Foreigners have not been targeted. Further attacks are likely.

### Demonstrations and strikes

Political protests are common in Nepal and sometimes result in violence.

Politically motivated protests have been particularly volatile in Kathmandu as well as in Nepal's southern region bordering India, which has, at times, affected border crossings.

General strikes (locally referred to as bandhs) are a popular form of political expression and can occur on short notice throughout the country.

Avoid travelling on public transportation during or immediately preceding bandhs, because tourists have been injured doing so. Transportation to and from airports throughout Nepal could be affected. Army and police checkpoints are frequent, especially at night.

Even peaceful demonstrations and strikes can turn violent at any time. They can also affect access to essential services and supplies, and lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Adventure travel

#### Trekking and mountain climbing

Many popular trekking trails ascend higher than 5,500 metres.

Hikers and guides have been stranded, injured or killed while trekking.

Drops in temperature and changes in weather conditions, including blizzards and avalanches, can occur suddenly in mountainous regions at any time of year.

If you intend to trek or mountain climb:

* never do so alone and always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company
* buy travel insurance that covers incidents related to these types of recreational activities
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to tackle the challenges of your activity
* ensure that you have proper equipment and bring sufficient water
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary, including when you expect to be back to camp
* know the symptoms of high-altitude illnesses, dehydration and heatstroke, which can be fatal
* obtain detailed information on your activity and the environment in which you will be setting out

Emergency services such as evacuations and rescues from remote areas are available, but can be hindered by:

* the lack of immediate payment to helicopter rescue service providers
* lack of a response from clients' insurance companies
* limited access to regular phone service in many trekking areas

There have been helicopter rescue scams in the past. Ensure that you are dealing with reputable helicopter companies. Check with your trekking agency for updates on the security situation in the area.

#### Rafting

Organize white-water rafting excursions only through reputable agencies.

### Power cuts

Due to an energy shortage, electric power cuts, termed “load shedding,” are a year-round occurrence. They occur frequently for short periods and without advance notice.

### Public transportation

Public buses are often poorly maintained and accidents involving buses, often causing injuries and fatalities, are common.

Avoid travelling on overnight buses.

Tourist buses are generally safe.

Boat accidents are common due to the overloading and poor maintenance of vessels. Do not board vessels that appear overloaded or unfit, especially where there are strong currents.

Travel providers and bus companies will not provide any compensation in the event of an accident. To recover items lost during an accident, contact local police.

### Roads

#### Road conditions

Road conditions are poor throughout the country.

Many mountain and hill roads, which can be hazardous even in the best weather, are intermittently impassable during the monsoon due to landslides.

Driving can also be dangerous due to:

* insufficient lighting
* poorly maintained roads
* traffic jams and heavy traffic, especially in the Kathmandu Valley
* inexperienced drivers

#### Driving habits

Drivers often speed and do not respect traffic laws.

If you plan to travel by car, consider hiring a driver.

If you choose to drive:

* always drive defensively
* plan your trip in advance, especially if you are visiting a rural area
* avoid travelling after dark
* inform a friend or family member of your itinerary
