## Natural disasters and climate

### Climate change

Climate change is affecting Fiji. Extreme and unusual weather events are becoming more frequent and may affect your travel plans. Monitor local media for the latest information.

### Rainy and cyclone season

The rainy and cyclone season in the Pacific Islands Region takes place from November to April, but cyclones may occur at other times.

Severe storms, including rain and wind, can cause flooding and landslides, which can result in significant loss of life and extensive damage to infrastructure, and can hamper the provision of essential services.

Flooding can also cut off access to roads, including to the airport. The risk of leptospirosis often increases after a cyclone or flood when people come into contact with contaminated water or soil.

* Stay informed of the latest regional weather forecasts
* Stay in a safe place and limit movement during serious weather events
* Ensure you have sufficient potable water, food, and a battery-operated radio
* Avoid disaster areas
* Follow the advice of local authorities
