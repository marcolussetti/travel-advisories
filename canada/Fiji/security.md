## Safety and security

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and bag snatching, occurs frequently, especially in downtown Suva and Nadi. Thieves target tourists.

Theft is common, particularly in crowded public areas such as:

* popular tourist areas, including lookouts, swimming holes, waterfalls and parks
* buses, trains, bus and train stations and airports
* hotel lobbies
* restaurants, including outdoor seating areas

During your trip:

* keep your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, in a secure place
* keep electronic devices like cellphones, tablets, laptops and cameras out of sight
* avoid showing signs of affluence or wearing expensive jewellery
* do not carry large sums of cash or valuables unnecessarily
* be aware of your surroundings, especially in busy tourist areas
* be extra cautious when withdrawing cash from ATMs

#### Violent crime

Violent crime occurs sometimes, especially in downtown Suva, Denarau Island and Colo-I-Suva Forest Park.

Incidents include:

* armed robberies
* burglaries
* assaults, including sexual and physical assaults
* home invasions

During your stay:

* always be aware of your surroundings
* avoid walking outside after dark, even in groups
* avoid isolated areas

Several foreigners in southern Fiji have been victims of suspected methanol-adulterated alcohol poisoning.

* Be vigilant if you choose to drink alcohol

### Adventure tourism

Outdoor activities, such as hiking, scuba diving and snorkelling, can be dangerous. Tour operators offers may not meet Canadian safety standards.

If you intend to participate in adventure tourism activities:

* share your itinerary with a friend or family member if you’re alone
* stay on marked trails and consider hiring an experienced guide from a reputable company
* buy travel insurance that covers incidents related to these types of recreational activities
* obtain detailed information on your activity and the environment in which you will be setting out
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to tackle the challenges of your activity
* refrain from using equipment if you are unsure of its condition or safety
* monitor weather conditions and other possible hazards

### Water activities

Most beaches are unsupervised and don’t have warning flags to alert of unsafe conditions.

* Respect the areas reserved for swimming
* Consult resort representatives, residents, and or tour operators for information on possible hazards, the presence of dangerous species and safe swimming areas
* Monitor weather conditions and avoid beaches and coastal areas if the weather forecast is poor
* Follow the instructions of local authorities

### Telecommunications

The telecommunications network is unreliable and likely unavailable in rural areas and remote islands.

* Bring a reliable means of communication, such as a satellite telephone or a VHF radio
* Inform a friend or family member of your itinerary

### Roads

#### Driving habits

Drivers do not always respect traffic laws. They often have little consideration for pedestrians and other drivers’ right of way. Pedestrians have been killed at marked pedestrian crossings.

If walking, be extra cautious at street corners and when crossing the street. Do not assume cars will stop for you.

Drinking and driving may occur at any time of the day or night.

If you choose to drive:

* exercise caution and be wary of erratic driving behaviour
* avoid travelling outside of cities after dark
* only use main roads and highways
* park your vehicle in a secure area, especially at night
* ask about insurance coverage options for roadside assistance when you rent a vehicle

#### Road conditions

Road conditions vary throughout the country. Roads are adequate in major cities, but in rural areas, they are poorly maintained and likely not paved.

Driving can be dangerous due to:

* insufficient lighting
* potholes and uneven surfaces
* bad road markings and signages
* flooding and hidden hazards during rainy season

### Public transportation

#### Buses

Public buses are poorly maintained. There have been severe accidents with buses catching on fire.

* Avoid city and intercity public buses and minivans
* Only use buses with yellow license plates
* Unlicensed minibuses may not be insured

#### Taxis

Many taxis are in poor condition and may not have seatbelts. Some taxis only take cash payments.

* Only use officially marked taxis with yellow license plates
* Only use reputable taxi companies through establishments such as hotels
* Arrange your pickup with your hotel before arrival when travelling by air or use authorized cabs at the airport
* Never share a taxi with strangers
