# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Crime

Petty crime, such as theft from hotel rooms and purse snatching, is common.

Theft and assault, including armed and sexual assault, may occur.

* Be particularly vigilant at night in urban areas
* Do not show signs of affluence, and be cautious when exchanging money at hotels or withdrawing money from ATMs or banks
* Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times

### Unregulated alcohol

Several foreigners in southern Fiji have been victims of suspected methanol-adulterated alcohol poisoning.

* Be vigilant if you choose to drink alcohol
* Seek medical assistance if you begin to feel sick

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety can vary greatly throughout the country.

Roads are adequate in major cities but poor in rural areas.

Stay on main roads; avoid secondary roads.

Roadside assistance is not widely available. Avoid driving outside of major cities after dark.

Road hazards may include pedestrians, domestic or wild animals, lack of signage and poor lighting. Vehicles are generally poorly maintained.

### Public transportation

Use taxis and minibuses with yellow registration plates, which denote compliance with Land Transport Authority regulations. Unlicensed minibuses may not be insured. Do not share taxis with strangers.

Travel by boat or ferry on coastal waters and inter-island trips should be undertaken only with a reputable tour company. If you are contemplating sea journeys, check weather reports before heading out.
