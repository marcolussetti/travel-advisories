## Safety and security

### General election

Ahead of Tanzania’s general election on October 29, 2025, political tensions may increase and there could be demonstrations.

Local authorities may adjust security measures and restrict movement.

Even peaceful gatherings can occasionally lead to disruptions or affect traffic and public transportation.

If you are in Tanzania:

* avoid demonstrations and large gatherings
* expect an increased presence of security forces
* monitor local media to stay informed of the latest information
* follow the instructions of local authorities

### Border with Mozambique in the Mtwara region

Extremist groups are active in the northern districts of Cabo Delgado, Mozambique. Security incidents have occurred along the border, in the Mtwara Region. Tanzanian military and security forces conduct counterinsurgency operations in the area where access is controlled in several locations and movements in and out are monitored.

### Southern Mtwara region

Armed groups have been active in the southern Mtwara region between highway 19 and 10 km from the border with Mozambique. There is a threat of terrorism and kidnappings in this region.

### Border with Burundi and Democratic Republic of Congo (Kinshasa)

Exercise a high degree of caution when travelling near refugee camps in northwestern Tanzania, particularly in the region of Kigoma and to the west of Kagera bordering Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, due to banditry.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations can occur anywhere across the country and sometimes on short notice. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

#### Kidnappings

Kidnapping-for-ransom does not pose a significant risk in Tanzania, but it cannot be ruled out since armed groups from neighboring countries are known to employ this tactic.

Exercise caution along the following border areas:

* around Lake Tanganyika, which marks the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo
* the southeastern border with Mozambique

#### Express kidnappings

Express kidnappings have occurred near hotels and transportation facilities such as ferry, bus and train terminals, in Dar es Salaam, where kidnappers demand small immediate ransoms.

Criminals kidnap the victim from the street or a taxi and force the person to withdraw funds from an ATM. The victim is sometimes held overnight so that a second withdrawal can be made the next day.

These kidnappings are sometimes committed by taxi or ride-share apps drivers.

* Only use reputable cab companies or ride-sharing apps
* When using a ride sharing app, ensure the vehicle license plate is the same as the one displayed on the app.
* Do not accept rides from new acquaintances or strangers
* Avoid hailing taxis on the street
* Do not get into a vehicle that already has a passenger in it
* If you're threatened by armed criminals, stay calm and don’t resist

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism.

Tanzania remains vulnerable to terrorist groups active in neighbouring countries. Terrorist attacks cannot be ruled out.

Terrorists may target public places and crowded areas.

Targets could include:

* government buildings
* schools
* places of worship
* public areas frequented by foreigners, such as restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centers, markets, hotels and other tourist destinations

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

Be particularly vigilant during:

* sporting events
* religious holidays
* public celebrations
* major political events, such as election

Terrorists may use such occasions to mount attacks.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Tanzanian law prohibits sexual acts between individuals of the same sex. Those convicted face up to life imprisonment and possibly a fine.

2SLGBTQI+ persons have been subject to physical and verbal harassment by the local population and authorities.

Security forces sometimes carry out arbitrary arrests and searches based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Interventions include:

* detentions
* interrogations
* alleged physical abuse.

2SLGBTQI+ travellers should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Tanzania.

### Spiked food and drinks

Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

### Roads

#### Road safety

There are major road safety issues in Tanzania. Fatal accidents are common, and they often involve pedestrians. Police and emergency services assistance is limited or even unavailable in rural areas.

#### Road conditions

Road conditions vary throughout the country and at different times of the year. Driving conditions may be hazardous during the rainy season from March to May and then again from November to December. Sometimes near-zero visibility is a risk. A four-wheel-drive vehicle may be necessary to travel outside cities, off major highways and during the rainy season.

Roads are poorly maintained and can be dangerous due to:

* potholes
* stray animals
* numerous motorcycles and bicycles
* lack of traffic signs
* pedestrians on the road
* insufficient lighting and vehicles not using their headlights
* poorly maintained vehicles

#### Driving habits

Drivers often disregard traffic laws and speeding is common. Pedestrians and other drivers’ rights of way are not respected. Drivers often don’t stop at traffic lights, making intersections very prone to accidents.

Traffic accidents can quickly draw large and sometimes hostile crowds. Remain calm if there is a dispute, particularly in a public place. If threatened by a large crowd, seek direct intervention from the local police.

If you choose to drive in Tanzania:

* always drive defensively
* avoid driving after dark outside of urban centres
* always keep doors and windows closed and locked
* consider using a four-wheel-drive vehicle outside urban centres
* fill your gas tank before you travel
* during the rainy season, confirm with local authorities that the chosen route is passable

#### Checkpoints

Police checkpoints are common throughout the country. Only national police officers have the authority to establish checkpoints.

* Be prepared to show your identification
* Follow the instructions of the police
* Remain calm and courteous

If you are asked to pay a fine on the spot for a traffic violation, ask for a copy of the written fine that can be paid later, or insist on going to the nearest police station.

### Fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud occurs. Be cautious when using your credit or debit card at ATMs.

* pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others
* use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers that have an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

Foreigners have been victims of scams relating to volunteer work visas and safaris.

If you plan to engage in these activities, only deal with reputable companies and make verifications beforehand.

#### Cybersecurity

Cybercrime, malware attacks and online extortion may occur in Tanzania.

Cybercriminals can compromise public Wi-Fi networks to steal personal data or credit information.

They can also monitor social media and listen to your phone conversations.

* Avoid shopping on unencrypted websites
* Be cautious when posting information on social media
* Be especially cautious if you decide to meet someone you met online
* Don't click on suspicious links that ask for your banking information in an e-mail or text message

### National parks and nature reserves

Many national parks and nature reserves are in remote areas with limited emergency services. Wild animals often venture within boundaries of camps.

If you decide to visit parks and reserves:

* Only use reputable and professional guides or tour operators
* Follow the advice and warnings of local tour guides and camp employees
* Do not walk around at night
* Never leave children unattended

### Wildlife observation

Wild animals can be dangerous, particularly if you are on foot or at close range.

* Always maintain a safe distance when observing wildlife
* Only exit a vehicle when a professional guide or warden says it’s safe to do so
* Closely follow park regulations and wardens’ advice

### Mount Kilimanjaro

If you are considering climbing Mount Kilimanjaro, carefully consider the risks involved. People are seriously injured or killed on the mountain every year, and emergency assistance is severely limited.

If you intend to climb:

* share your itinerary with a friend or family member if you’re alone
* stay on marked trails and consider hiring an experienced guide from a reputable company
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* ensure that you are properly equipped and well informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary, including when you expect to be back to camp
* know the symptoms of high-altitude illnesses, dehydration and heatstroke, which can be fatal

### Water activities

Costal waters can be dangerous, even for experienced swimmers. Riptides are common. Several drownings occur each year. Beaches are generally unsupervised. There is no warning system to alert of unsafe conditions.

If you plan to participate in boating activities, such as snorkelling or diving:

* use a reputable company
* ensure that life jackets are available for all passengers
* do not use the equipment if you are unsure of its safety
* consult residents and tour operators for information on possible hazards, the presence of dangerous species and safe swimming areas
* don’t board boats that appear unseaworthy

### Power outages

Power outages occur regularly across the country. Local authorities may impose rationing measures for electricity.

### Telecommunications

Cellular coverage is usually good in main cities but may be limited outside of urban areas.

### Public transportation

#### Buses

Buses, locally known as “dala dala” are unsafe, overcrowded and frequently involved in fatal accidents. There have also been reports of sexual assault on buses. You should avoid using buses.

Intercity buses are usually safer.

The risks are increased when travelling after dark.

#### Taxis and ridesharing services

Taxis availability may be limited outside city centers.

* Avoid using motorcycle taxis, locally known as “pika-pika “or “boda-boda” or three-wheel taxis, “bajaj”, as they are frequently involved in accidents
* Use only licensed taxis selected by a reputable hotel or restaurant, or one located at an official taxi stand
* Never share a taxi with strangers
* Make sure the driver doesn’t pick up other passengers along the way to your destination
* Always ask for identification before accepting transportation and check that the driver’s ID matches the name of the car registration and taxi licence
* Ask the driver to start the meter or negotiate the fare in advance
* Have small bills ready for payment

Rideshare services are available.

* Use a trusted ridesharing app
* Confirm the driver’s identity and the licence plate before getting in the car
* Don't share your ride with another person
* Use a security feature to share your ride status with a contact

#### Trains

The electric train service between Dar es Salaam and Morogoro is regular and reliable. Maintenance standards are low for trains on all other lines. There have been reports of theft on crowded trains, particularly on overnight travels.

#### Ferries

There are regular and reliable ferries travelling between Dar es Salaam and Zanzibar. The ferries operating on other routes are less reliable and often overcrowded. Tanzanian ports are often frequented by persuasive ticket scalpers, insistent porters and sellers. They are crowded and prone to petty crime.

Ferry accidents occur due to the overloading and poor maintenance of some vessels.

* Make sure the vessel you are boarding is carrying appropriate safety equipment and that life jackets are provided for all passengers and accessible at all times
* Only use reputable ferry companies
* Do not board vessels that appear overloaded or unseaworthy
* Avoid using water means of transportation during bad weather conditions

### Piracy

Pirate attacks and armed robbery against ships occur in coastal waters, particularly in the Indian Ocean. Mariners should take appropriate precautions.
