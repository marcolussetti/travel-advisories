# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Tanzanian authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Health screening measures

Due to the ongoing outbreak of mpox, you will be subject to health screening measures, such as temperature checks, at any point of entry.

If you have symptoms of mpox, you will be tested and receive treatment at designated government health facilities, if necessary, until you are cleared to travel by local health authorities.

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you use for travel.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond the date you expect to leave Tanzania.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. People with an X gender identifier have been denied entry into Tanzania. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Working and volunteering in Tanzania

You cannot perform any type of work, including volunteer work, on a tourist visa. When planning to travel to Tanzania to do volunteer work, contact the High Commission for the United Republic of Tanzania for information on specific requirements.
