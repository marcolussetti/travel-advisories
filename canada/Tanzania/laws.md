### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Tanzania.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of Tanzania, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Tanzania.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Tanzania by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Tanzania to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Money

The currency is the Tanzanian shilling (TZS).

Tanzanian shillings or U.S. dollars are the preferred method of payment. Credit cards are not widely accepted in rural areas.

ATMs are available in main cities, and some can be used to access Canadian bank accounts. However, they occasionally run out of cash, especially on holidays and during weekends. You should carry a small amount of U.S. dollars for use in airports and at borders. You must declare all currencies exceeding 10,000 U.S. dollars upon arrival and departure from Tanzania.
