## Safety and security

### Increased political tensions

The decision on the impeachment trial of the former president is expected anytime after March 17, 2025.

Since December 2024, large protests have been taking place in South Korea. These demonstrations are expected to continue and crowd sizes can increase significantly during weekend protests.

More than 100,000 demonstrators are expected at protests in the following areas of Seoul:

* the Yeouido neighbourhood
* the National Assembly and political party headquarters area
* Gwanghwamun Square
* areas around:

+ Constitutional Court
+ Seoul Central District Court
+ Seoul Western District Court

* official presidential residence

Protests could begin anywhere in South Korea and may turn violent. Demonstrations are expected to continue in the coming days.

Traffic and public transportation disruptions are also expected.

If you are in South Korea:

* exercise caution
* avoid participating in or being near demonstrations and large gatherings
* monitor local media for the latest information
* follow the instructions of local authorities

### Tensions on the Korean Peninsula

Tensions on the Korean Peninsula could escalate with little notice and the security situation could deteriorate suddenly. Tensions may increase before, during and after North Korean nuclear and missile tests, military exercises or as the result of incidents or military activities at or near the inter-Korean border.

Monitor developments, remain vigilant and follow the instructions of local authorities. We strongly recommend that Canadians register with the Registration of Canadians Abroad service to receive the latest updates.

### Crime

Crime against foreigners is generally low. Petty crime occurs in major metropolitan areas, tourist sites and public markets. Remain aware of your surroundings in crowded entertainment, nightlife and shopping districts.

Petty crime and sexual harassment can occur in public spaces including bars and restaurants, and on buses.

* Avoid walking alone, especially after dark.
* Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times.

You can report crimes, including a sexual assault, to the Korean National Police Agency by dialling 112. This is a 24-hour, 7-day-a-week service. For non-Korean speakers, the police will link an interpreter into the call.

### Women’s safety

Women travelling alone may be subject to certain forms of harassment. Sexual assault and harassment do occur, particularly around bars and nightlife areas, such as Itaewon and Hongdae-Ipgu.

Local authorities may not always respond adequately to reports of sexual violence and harassment. If you are sexually assaulted, you should report it immediately to local authorities and to the nearest Canadian government office.

* Avoid travelling alone, especially at night
* Remain vigilant
* Be careful when dealing with strangers or recent acquaintances

### Demonstrations

Political, labour and student demonstrations and marches may occur.

South Korean law prohibits political activities by foreigners.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can lead to significant disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Civil emergency exercises

Civil emergency exercises are held for fires, earthquakes, other disasters and civil defence drills by the Ministry of the Interior and Safety.

In 2024, four exercises will take place in March, May, August and October. The exercise on August 21, 2024, will be a nationwide exercise. Depending on the exercise, sirens may sound, transport may stop and authorities may ask some people to take shelter in metro stations or basements. While visitor participation is not necessary, familiarize yourself with procedures and check local announcements for further exercises.

### Emergency assistance mobile application

The Ministry of the Interior and Safety offers a free emergency assistance mobile application called Emergency Ready (available on Google Play and iTunes). The app allows users to contact  emergency services, locate the closest medical centre or shelter and view first aid videos.

### Road safety

The rate of fatal road accidents is very high. Check carefully before crossing the road. Vehicles may not stop at pedestrian crossings. Use underground or above-ground pedestrian crossings, where available.

Speeding, running red lights, lane changes without signalling and other risky driving behaviours are common, particularly by buses, taxis and motorcyclists. Motorcycles are sometimes driven on sidewalks.

Automobile drivers are presumed to be at fault in accidents involving motorcycles or pedestrians. Criminal charges and heavy penalties are common when accidents result in injury. Even if negligence is not proven, you may be subject to criminal charges.

### Public transportation

The use of public transport after dark may be safer than using taxis when travelling alone. When subway and bus services end for the night, use officially marked taxis only. It is mandatory to fasten your seatbelt in a taxi. Drivers may speak some English, but have your destination written in Korean.

High-speed train services (KTX and SRT) link Seoul and major southern cities such as Busan, Gwangju and Mokpo.
