### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences, heavy fines and deportation. Minor violations, including smoking small quantities of an illegal drug such as cannabis (even in a private home) can result in pre-trial detention.

### Photography

### Driving

You must carry an International Driving Permit or a South Korean driver’s licence.

Penalties for drinking and driving are severe. The legal blood alcohol limit is 0.03%. If the police suspect you of drinking and driving, they could confiscate your driver’s licence on the spot. If you’re convicted, you can expect heavy fines and a jail sentence.

### Teaching English

Carefully review any contract to teach English in South Korea before signing it, even when arranged by a Canadian recruiter. There have been reports that some contracts have been modified after the fact. Ensure that all terms and conditions of employment are clear before accepting an offer. Ensure that you meet all the necessary requirements.

The Korean government investigates the use of fraudulent documents, degrees and English-as-a-second-language (ESL) certificates. Penalties for using fraudulent documents include arrest, deportation and restrictions on re-entry. Be aware that written contracts may not be binding documents. Verbal agreements often take precedence over written agreements.

### Dual citizenship

South Korea legally recognizes dual citizenship. If you’re a citizen of Canada, but also a citizen of South Korea, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you’re there. You may also be subject to different entry/exit requirements.

The South Korean government considers children born from a Korean and a non-Korean parent to be South Korean citizens until age 18, even if they weren’t born in South Korea. Former Koreans over 65 who wish to live their remaining years in South Korea may be granted citizenship.

A male dual citizen whose name appears on the Korean family relation certificate may be subject to compulsory military service, even when entering South Korea on a Canadian passport. Before travelling to South Korea, Canadian males of Korean origin may need to renounce their Korean citizenship or have their names removed from the Korean family relation certificate to avoid this requirement.

Korean authorities will only recognize you as a Canadian-South Korean citizen if you meet certain criteria. If you think you may have a claim to South Korean citizenship, contact the Embassy of the Republic of Korea or one of its consulates.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and South Korea.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in South Korea, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the South Korean court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in South Korea to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Although the laws of South Korea do not prohibit sexual acts between individuals of the same sex, homosexuality is not socially tolerated. Same sex marriages are not legally recognised in South Korea.

2SLGBTQI+ persons should carefully consider the risks of travelling to South Korea.

### Money

The currency in South Korea is the won (KRW). Some major banks have ATMs that accept international debit or credit cards. The amount allowed per withdrawal may be quite low, making the service charge excessive. Most ATMs that allow withdrawal of money from Canadian bank accounts offer English instructions.
