Wildfires are burning in central and southern parts of the country. Since March 23, 2025, fires have grown rapidly in Gyeongsang Province, near Uiseong and Yeongdeok. Evacuation orders and warnings are in effect for multiple zones.

Several roads in the area are closed and there is low visibility for drivers due to smoke. Air quality is poor due to smoke and ash.
