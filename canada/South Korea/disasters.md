Wildfires are common in the spring months, but are generally contained within inaccessible areas. The air quality in areas near active fires may deteriorate due to heavy smoke. In case of a major fire:

* stay away from the affected area, particularly if you suffer from respiratory ailments
* follow the instructions of local emergency services personnel
* monitor local media for up-to-date information on the situation
