# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Cuban authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for the expected duration of your stay in Cuba.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Visas

Tourist visa: required  
 Family visa: required  
 Business visa: required

Canadian tourists travelling to Cuba need a visa, which allows for stays of up to 90 days.

The tourist visa is generally included in holiday packages provided by tour operators or airlines providing direct flights from Canada.

If you travel to Cuba via a third country, including on flights with stopovers in a third country, you must obtain a Cuban electronic visa ahead of time. A 10-character code will be provided, which you must include when filling out the online customs form.

### Length of stay

You may stay in Cuba for up to 6 months, but you must request an extension of stay if you intend to stay longer than the initial 90-day period allowed by the standard tourist visa.

### Online customs form

You must provide information on your stay in Cuba via an online customs form before entering the country. You may complete it as early as 72 hours before entry.

Once done, you will receive a QR code by email.

You must show an electronic or printed version of the QR code upon check-in and to authorities upon arrival.

### Cash controls

You cannot leave Cuba with more than $5,000 USD or the equivalent in any currency. You also cannot leave Cuba with more than $5,000 CUP.

### Health insurance

You must be able to show proof of medical insurance upon entry to Cuba. If you don’t have proof of health insurance or if the proof you present doesn’t satisfy the Cuban immigration authorities, you may have to obtain health insurance from a Cuban insurance company upon arrival. This insurance may have limited coverage.

Canadian provincial health care coverage provides very limited coverage outside Canada. It won’t pay for medical bills up front and does not include air evacuation.

Cuban authorities won’t let you leave the country with outstanding medical bills. You will need to remain in Cuba until all debts are paid. Medical bills are payable by credit card only.

* Make sure you purchase the best health insurance you can afford
* Ensure the insurance includes medical evacuation and hospital stays

### Other entry requirements

Customs officials may ask you to show them:

* a return or onward ticket
* proof of accommodation

### Dual citizenship

If you’re both a Canadian and Cuban citizen, you must:

* present your valid Cuban passport to the immigration authorities to enter Cuba
* have a valid Canadian passport to return to Canada

If you were born in Cuba, you should contact a Cuban government office in Canada before you leave to ensure compliance with Cuban regulations, regardless of your current citizenship. Failure to do so may result in your being refused entry into Cuba or being detained upon entry.

### Canadian permanent residents

You will not be able to leave Cuba if you are a Canadian permanent resident and are without a valid permanent resident card. If your card is lost or stolen, you must contact the Embassy of Canada to Cuba, in Havana, to obtain a travel document that will allow you to leave the country.

This procedure can take up to 10 working days. Once the document is ready, you'll need to make an appointment with the immigration section of the Embassy of Canada to Cuba to collect it before returning to Canada.

### Health screening

You may be subjected to a medical screening or interrogation by public health authorities when you enter or exit Cuba, or when reporting for domestic flights.

You may be subject to a mandatory quarantine for medical observation for up to 7 days if local authorities believe that:

* you have symptoms of a serious illness, such as:
  + COVID-19
  + Dengue
  + Ebola
  + H1N1

  + you’re arriving from a country with a known epidemic

### Restricted goods

#### Personal effects and medicine

You should bring all personal goods, including toiletries and medication, that you may require for the duration of your travel. Many of these items may be difficult to find in Cuba.

Cuban customs officials will decide if the amount is suitable for your personal use. They may apply steep tariffs for personal baggage exceeding the allowable amount.

#### Art objects

Some art objects, including artifacts and paintings purchased in Cuba, must be accompanied by an export permit. It’s usually provided by state-owned galleries. If you plan on buying art from a gallery, always confirm that you will be able to leave the country with it.

Satellite telephones are forbidden.
