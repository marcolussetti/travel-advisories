# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and bag snatching, occurs.

Theft generally occurs in crowded places such as:

* tourist areas
* markets
* public buses
* night clubs
* beaches

It can also occur in isolated areas.

Cuba has a cash-based economy. You may need to carry large amounts of cash to make larger purchases, but doing so could make you a target for theft or robbery. You should avoid showing large amounts of cash in public.

Theft from hotel rooms, particularly in private accommodations (“casas particulares”), and from cars, is common.

* Always keep your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, in a secure place
* Do not pack valuables in your checked luggage
* Avoid showing signs of affluence
* Keep electronic devices out of sight
* Keep a digital and a hard copy of your identification and travel documents
* Never leave belongings unattended in a vehicle, even in the trunk

#### Violent crime

Incidents of violent crime are not frequent, but assaults may occur. They mainly occur during a burglary or robbery.

* Stay in accommodations with good security
* Keep your windows and doors locked at all times
* If you’re threatened by robbers, stay calm and do not resist

#### Sexual assault

Incidents of sexual assault against Canadian women have occurred, including at beach resorts.

If you’re a victim of a sexual assault, you should report it immediately to the nearest Government of Canada office. You should file a report with the Cuban authorities and ensure that local police provide you with proof of complaint (“comprobante de denuncia”) confirming that a report has been filed. A criminal investigation will not be possible if no formal complaint is made to Cuban authorities before you depart the country.

Police officers may only speak Spanish.

* Avoid secluded areas, even on resorts and hotel grounds
* Exercise caution when dealing with strangers or recent acquaintances
* Avoid taking public transportation or walking alone at night

### Fraud

#### Overcharging

Some businesses, including taxis and classic car rentals, may try to charge exorbitant prices.

* Always confirm the price before ordering or purchasing a good or service
* Do not leave an open tab
* Avoid giving your credit card to bar or restaurant staff
* Check the accuracy of your bill before paying

#### Scams

Some hustlers specialize in defrauding tourists, sometimes using threats or violence. Most of them speak some English or French and go out of their way to appear friendly. They may offer to serve as guides or facilitate the purchase of cigars.

Fraudulent tour agents and taxi drivers also operate throughout the country, including at Havana’s international airport. Thefts of luggage from taxi trunks have occurred.

In bars, sex workers, including minors, may be very persistent and intrusive with tourists who refuse their advances. Foreigners, including Canadians, have been victims of theft after engaging in sexual relations, and some of them have faced child sex accusations.

* Only use reputable tour operators and registered taxis
* Avoid independent street vendors
* Be wary of strangers who seem too friendly

### Power outages

Cuba experienced nationwide power outages in 2024. The electrical system is vulnerable and outages can occur suddenly. Scheduled power cuts regularly take place to conserve power, particularly outside Havana, and can last many hours.

Most large hotels and resorts use generators during power outages.

* Monitor local media for the latest information
* Try to keep your phone charged
* Plan accordingly

### Shortages

Cuba faces chronic and severe shortages of ‎basic necessities, including:

* food
* bottled water
* public water supply
* medication
* fuel
* hard currency

Fuel shortages affect a wide range of services. Travelling across the island is extremely challenging. Public transportation services, including taxis, are often disrupted, leaving tourists with few options to travel. Some travellers have been temporarily stranded with a rental car. There are often long line-ups at gas stations that have led to altercations.

Intermittent shortages of tap water provided by municipalities occur, including in Havana. Water shortages have affected resorts in the past.

* Plan accordingly
* Bring some supplies with you, including toiletries and medication
* Keep a supply of water, food and fuel on hand
* Make sure you always have access to a complete emergency kit

### Harassment

Individuals, including women, 2SLGBTQI+ persons and members of racialized groups, have been subject to harassment or verbal abuse.

Avoid travelling alone, especially at night. If you are the victim of harassment, you should report it immediately to the police and the nearest Government of Canada office.

### Spiked food, drinks and other items

Never leave your food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Avoid accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as these items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

### Telecommunications

The telecommunications network in Cuba is poor. Connections are unreliable and may be intermittent.

Canadian cell phones may not work, even in large cities. Internet access is limited across the island.

Local authorities control telecommunications. They may block access, including to social media, in case of civil unrest or before demonstrations.

* Do not rely on your cell phone for emergencies, especially outside major cities
* Subscribe to and install a VPN service before leaving Canada

#### Online transactions

Online banking may be challenging in Cuba. Most Cuban websites are unsecure. Many are inaccessible from outside of Cuba.

If you plan to book online, you should confirm that your hotel accepts online reservations and payments.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations occur occasionally. All demonstrations against the government are illegal. Local authorities may break up demonstrations or gatherings not sanctioned by the government.

Many demonstrators have been arrested. If you are close to a demonstration, you may be detained by the Cuban authorities.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time.

* Do not participate in demonstrations
* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Water activities

#### Swimming

Tidal changes can cause powerful currents, and riptides are common. Lifeguard services don’t always meet Canadian standards. Not all beaches have lifeguards or warning flags to warn of unsafe conditions.

In marine areas, coral, jellyfish, stingrays and other marine life, especially the Portuguese man o’ war or “agua mala,” can poison, sting or cause infection if touched or stepped on.

Consult residents and tour operators for information on possible hazards, the presence of dangerous species and safe swimming areas. You should not swim in areas where harmful marine life is present.

* Never swim alone or after hours
* Do not swim outside marked areas
* Respect warning flags on the beach and do not swim when there is a red flag flying

* Avoid beaches and coastal areas if the weather forecast is poor

* Do not dive in unfamiliar waters, as hidden rocks or shallow depths can cause serious injury or death

* Follow the instructions of local authorities

#### Diving

Tour operators and diving centres may not meet Canadian safety standards. If you go diving:

* use a reputable company
* do not use the equipment if you are unsure of its safety
* make sure that your travel insurance covers incidents related to this type of recreational activity

#### Recreational boating

If you plan to go boating:

* know and respect the navigation rules
* have life jackets available for all passengers
* follow safe practices for all water activities such as jet skiing, water skiing or fishing
* do not overload your boat capacity
* carry a VHF marine radio that will generate your position in case of emergency
* be prepared for emergencies

### Roads

#### Road conditions

Road conditions are poor throughout the island, except the west-east Central Highway.

Driving may be dangerous due to:

* poorly maintained roads
* lack of traffic signs
* insufficient lighting
* livestock and horse-drawn carts

* pedestrians on the road

* slow-moving traffic

Many Cuban cars are old and in poor condition. They often lack standard safety equipment. Some cars and most bicycles don’t have functioning lights.

#### Driving habits

Some drivers don’t respect traffic laws. Many of them, driving electric bicycles for which licence and registration are not required, are inexperienced and unqualified. Drinking and driving is also common.

If you choose to drive in Cuba:

* always drive defensively
* avoid travelling after dark

* never pick up hitchhikers, who have been known to assault drivers

### Public transportation

#### Buses

Public buses are unreliable, scarce, overcrowded and poorly maintained.

If you plan to travel by bus, use a private service offered by a tour company or resort.

#### Taxis

Old-model private vehicles offered as taxis are not equipped with standard safety features. They have no insurance coverage for passengers in case of an accident.

* Use only officially marked taxis
* Avoid hailing taxis on the street
* Never share a taxi with strangers
* Agree on a fare before departure, as taxis are not equipped with meters

#### Trains

The rail network is unreliable and slow.
