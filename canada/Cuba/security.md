## Safety and security

### Nationwide power outages

Cuba has been experiencing nationwide power outages since October 18, 2024. The electrical system is vulnerable and additional outages can occur suddenly. Previous outages persist in some places and scheduled power cuts regularly take place to conserve power.

Most large hotels and resorts use generators during power outages. However, they may not be able to maintain their services should an extended outage occur.

* Monitor local media for the latest information
* Try to keep your phone charged
* Plan accordingly

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs.

Theft generally occurs in crowded places such as:

* tourist areas
* markets
* public buses
* night clubs
* beaches

It can also occur in isolated areas.

Theft from hotel rooms, particularly in private accommodations (*casas particulares*), and from cars is common.

* Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Don’t pack valuables in your checked luggage
* Avoid showing signs of affluence
* Keep electronic devices out of sight
* Carry valid identification at all times
* Keep a digital and a hard copy of your ID and travel documents
* Avoid carrying large amounts of cash
* Never leave belongings unattended in a vehicle, even in the trunk

#### Violent crime

Incidents of violent crime are not frequent, but assaults may occur. They mainly occur during a burglary or robbery.

* Stay in accommodations with good security
* Keep your windows and doors locked at all times
* If threatened by robbers, don't resist

### Fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud may occur.

Be cautious when using debit or credit cards:

* pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others
* use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

#### Overcharge

Some businesses may try to charge exorbitant prices, namely taxis and classic car rentals. Disputes about overcharging may lead to violence.

* Always confirm prices before consuming or taking up a service
* Avoid running a tab
* Avoid leaving your credit card with bar or restaurant staff
* Check your bill to make sure it’s exact

#### Scams

Some hustlers specialize in defrauding tourists. Most of them speak some English or French and go out of their way to appear friendly. They may offer to serve as tour guides or to facilitate the purchase of cigars. Some have used violence in their efforts to steal tourists.

Fraudulent tour agents and taxi drivers also operate throughout the country, including at Havana’s international airport. Thefts of luggage from taxi trunks have occurred.

In bars, sex workers, including minors, may be very persistent and intrusive with tourists who refuse their advances. Foreigners, including Canadians, have been the victim of theft after engaging in sexual relations, and some of them have faced child sex accusations.

* Use reputable tour operators and registered taxis only
* Avoid independent street vendors
* Be wary of strangers who seem too friendly

### Shortages

Cuba faces chronic and severe shortages of ‎basic necessities, including:

* food
* bottled water
* public water supply
* medication
* fuel
* hard-currency

Fuel shortages are currently critical and affect a wide range of services. Travelling across the island is extremely challenging. Public transportation services, including taxis, are often disrupted, leaving tourists with few options to travel. Some travellers have been temporarily stranded with a rental car. Intermittent shortages of tap water provided by municipalities happen, including in Havana and in resorts.

During a power outage, large hotels and resorts use generators but some services, such as air conditioning or hot water, may be affected. Fuel shortages may also affect government services.

Access to food and medications can also be a challenge.

Power outages may lead to disruptions to other essential services. There are often long line-ups at gas stations that have led to altercations.

* Plan accordingly
* Bring some basic necessities with you such as toiletries and medication
* Keep a supply of water, food and fuel on hand
* Make sure you always have access to a complete emergency kit

Obtaining services and information during a power outage can be challenging.

### Women’s safety

Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of sexual harassment

Incidents of sexual assault against Canadian women have occurred, including at beach resorts.

If you’re the victim of a sexual assault, you should report it immediately to the nearest Canadian consulate or embassy and seek medical assistance. You should also report the incident to Cuban authorities and ensure that local police provide you with a Comprobante de Denuncia. This document confirms that a report has been filed.

A criminal investigation will likely not be possible if no formal complaint is made to Cuban authorities before you depart the country.

Police officers may speak only Spanish.

### Spiked food and drinks

Snacks, beverages, gum and cigarettes may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

* Be wary of accepting these items from new acquaintances
* Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers

### Telecommunications

The telecommunications network in Cuba is poor. Connections are unreliable and may be intermittent.

Some Canadian cell phones may not work, even in large cities. Internet access is limited across the island.

Local authorities control telecommunications. They may block access to mobile phone and Internet in case of civil unrest or before demonstrations.

* Don’t rely on your mobile phone for emergencies, especially outside major cities
* Subscribe to and install a VPN service before leaving Canada
* Avoid travelling alone
* Inform a family member or friend of your itinerary

#### Online transactions

Online banking or shopping may be challenging in Cuba, if at all possible. Most Cuban websites are unsecure. Many are inaccessible.

Some travellers, who bought their travel package online on a travel website in Canada, found out on arrival in Cuba that their hotel received no reservation or payment.

* Plan accordingly
* Avoid online shopping
* Check with the hotel if they accept online reservations and payments if you plan to book online

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations sometimes occur, even if taking part in them may be illegal. Local authorities will break up political demonstrations or gatherings not sanctioned by the government. They may also block access to the Internet, including social media, without notice.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic, public transportation.

* Don’t participate in demonstrations
* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Water activities

#### Swimming

Rescue services may not be consistent with international standards. Tidal changes can cause powerful currents, and riptides are common. Not all beaches have lifeguards or warning flags to warn of hazardous conditions.

* Never swim alone or after hours
* Don’t swim outside marked areas
* Monitor weather warnings
* Avoid visiting beaches or coastal areas during periods of severe weather warnings
* Don’t dive into unknown water, as hidden rocks or shallow depths can cause serious injury or death
* Consult residents and tour operators for information on possible hazards and safe swimming areas
* Follow the instructions of local authorities

#### Diving

Tour operators and diving centres may not adhere to international standards.

If you undertake adventure sports, such as diving:

* choose a reputable company that has insurance
* ensure that your travel insurance covers the recreational activities you choose
* don’t use the equipment if you have any doubts about its safety

#### Recreational boating

If you are planning to go boating:

* know the navigation rules
* make sure life jackets are available for all passengers
* follow safe practices for all water activities such as jet-skiing, water-skiing or fishing
* don’t overload your boat capacity
* carry a VHF marine radio that will generate your position in case of emergency
* be prepared for emergencies

### Road safety

Road safety standards are poor throughout the country. Accidents causing fatalities are common.

#### Road conditions

Road conditions are poor throughout the island, with the exception of the Central Highway, which runs west to east across the country. Driving may be dangerous due to:

* poorly maintained roads
* lack of signage
* Inadequate lighting
* roaming livestock
* horse-drawn carts
* pedestrians
* slow-moving traffic

Most Cuban cars are old and in poor condition. They often lack standard safety equipment. Some cars and most bicycles don’t have functioning lights.

#### Driving habits

Some drivers don’t respect traffic laws. Many of them, driving an electric vehicle for which licence and registration are not required, are inexperienced and unqualified. Drinking and driving is also common.

If you choose to drive in Cuba:

* do so defensively at all times
* avoid travelling at night
* travel in groups when possible
* never pick up hitchhikers, who have been known to assault drivers

### Public transportation

#### Buses

City buses are scarce, overcrowded and poorly maintained. Bus service is not reliable.

Incidents of pickpocketing are frequent.

Tour companies offer good bus service between airports and the all-inclusive resorts. Buses used for organized day trips from hotels are usually in good condition.

#### Taxis

Official taxis are generally reliable.

Old-model private vehicles offered as taxis are not equipped with standard safety features. They have no insurance coverage for passengers in case of an accident.

* Use only registered taxis
* Avoid flagging a taxi down on the street
* Never share a taxi with strangers
* Agree on a fare before departure, as taxis are not equipped with meters

#### Trains

The rail network is comprehensive, connecting most of the island, but it’s unreliable and slow. Train service is limited to Cuban nationals only.

### Air travel

We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.
