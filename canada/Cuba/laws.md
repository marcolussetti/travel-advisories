## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Transfer to a Canadian prison

Canada and Cuba accede the Treaty between the Government of Canada and the Government of the Republic of Cuba on the Serving of Penal Sentences. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in Cuba to request a transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both Canadian and Cuban authorities. This process can take a long time, and there is no guarantee that the transfer will be approved by either or both sides.

### Cuban criminal justice

The criminal justice system in Cuba differs significantly from that in Canada. Charges are not laid until the investigation is complete. If you’re arrested in Cuba, you will likely be detained during the entire period of investigation. You should expect long delays to resolve your case. You will not be allowed to leave the country during this period.

Cuba’s constitution allows the death penalty, but since 2003, the country has effectively had a moratorium on carrying out death sentences.

### Investments

Private property rights in Cuba are strictly controlled. Only Cubans and permanent residents can buy a property in Cuba or register a privately owned vehicle. Be wary of strangers or acquaintances offering to purchase these items on your behalf. If you plan on making investments in Cuba, seek legal advice in Canada and Cuba. Do so before making commitments. Related disputes could take time and be costly to resolve.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect lengthy prison sentences.

* Pack your own luggage and monitor it closely at all times
* Don’t transport other people’s packages, bags or suitcases

### Child sex tourism

It's a serious criminal offence to have sex with minors in Cuba.

Local authorities are actively working to prevent child sex tourism. Tourists, including Canadians, have been convicted of offences related to the corruption of minors aged 16 and under.

Prison sentences for this type of crime range from 7 to 25 years. Release on bail before trial is unlikely.

### Marriage

 To get married in Cuba, you must provide several documents including:

* your birth certificate
* a copy of your passport
* your decree absolute certificate if divorced
* a death certificate for your spouse and a marriage certificate if widowed
* an affidavit of your single status if you have never been married before

All documents must be translated into Spanish, certified, authenticated and legalised by the Embassy of Cuba in Canada.

 Consult the Embassy of Cuba in Canada if you wish to marry in Cuba, including to a Cuban national.

### Drones

Drones are prohibited.

They will be confiscated by the authorities upon entry.

### Photography

Professional photographers require a visa to work in Cuba. They may also need a permit to import their equipment.

It’s forbidden to photograph, including with drones:

* military and police installations or personnel
* harbour, rail and airport facilities

Military zones and any other restricted or heavily guarded areas are not always identified.

### Identification

Authorities may request to see your ID at any time.

* Carry valid identification at all times
* Keep a photocopy of your passport in case it’s lost or seized
* Keep a digital copy of your ID and travel documents

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Cuba.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of Cuba, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Cuba.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Cuba by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Cuba to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Imports and exports

#### Personal effects and medicine

Tourists are allowed to enter Cuba with personal effects but items entering the country for donations may be subject to import rules. They could be seized and taxed in accordance with local legislation. This includes:

* clothing
* new or used material goods
* personal care products
* medications

Cuban customs officials have the authority to decide what they deem to be for the tourist's personal use. They may apply steep tariffs for personal baggage exceeding the allowable weight.

#### Cigars

You may export:

* up to 20 cigars without documentation
* up to 50 cigars if they are in their original container, closed and sealed with the official hologram

If exceeding these amounts, you must provide a guarantee of origin certificate.

Failure to comply with this regulation will lead to the seizure of the cigars without compensation.

#### Art objects

Art objects, including artifacts and paintings purchased in Cuba, must be accompanied by an export permit. It’s usually provided by state-owned galleries.

In the absence of such a permit, items must be registered with the Registro Nacional de Bienes Culturales.

#### Electronic devices

Electronic devices with GPS technology may be confiscated upon entry and returned upon departure.

Satellite telephones are forbidden.

#### Electronic cigarettes and personal vaporizers

You cannot bring electronic cigarettes or personal vaporizers to Cuba.

Customs officials will seize these items upon arrival.

#### Black market

Street vendors may offer you black-market goods, such as cigars, or ask to change dollars for Cuban currency.

Engaging in black-market transactions is illegal and can lead to difficulties with the Cuban authorities.

### Boat traffic

The U.S. government closely monitors boat traffic in the Straits of Florida. It will seize any vessel not bearing a licence from the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) if it believes it’s headed for Cuba.

You’re subject to these measures if you dock your Canadian-registered boat in Florida. You’ll be exempted if you are simply en route to Cuba via the U.S.

If travelling by boat to Cuba from the US:

* Make sure to know the regulation related to docking and port controls
* Expect thorough search and interrogations

### Driving

You should carry an international driving permit.

[International Driving Permit](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/documents/international-driving-permit)

#### Traffic accidents

Traffic accidents have led to arrest and detentions of Canadians in the past.

Accidents resulting in death or injury are treated as crimes. The onus is on the driver to prove innocence. If you’re found to bear responsibility in a traffic accident resulting in serious injury or death, you may face up to 10 years in prison.

If you’re involved in an accident:

* don’t leave the scene
* don’t move your vehicle
* call the police

While car insurance is mandatory for foreign drivers and foreign-registered vehicles, it's not for Cuban citizens. As a result, most local drivers don't carry a car insurance. You shouldn’t expect compensation for vehicle damage or personal injury from a Cuban driver following a car accident.

#### Vehicle rentals

Car insurance coverage in Cuba differs from that in Canada.

Rental agencies are government-controlled. If you’re found to be at fault in an accident, the rental agency will nullify your coverage and seek compensation to cover the cost of repairs.

Cuban authorities can prohibit you from leaving the country unless the rental agency receives payment or until all claims associated with an accident are settled.

Contract agreements don’t cover occasional drivers. As a result, the signatory is responsible for all people driving the vehicle.

* Be cautious if you rent a vehicle in Cuba
* Avoid renting a scooter; thieves target them and you may be responsible for the cost of its replacement
* Make sure to obtain a receipt when returning a rental vehicle

### Money

The currency of Cuba is the Cuban peso (CUP).

Credit cards issued by U.S. financial institutions or affiliated with U.S. banks are not accepted in Cuba.

Canadian credit cards are increasingly accepted at restaurants and hotels. However, the system is unreliable and bank cards may not work or may stop working without notice.

ATMs are rare and also unreliable. Each withdrawal is limited to 5 000 CUP, when possible.

You may obtain credit card cash advances at banks, hotels or a state-run exchange bureau, but in CUP only.

When travelling to Cuba, you should plan to bring enough currency to cover the duration of your stay. You should also plan for small bank notes to facilitate daily transactions such as, street food, taxis and tips.

You can easily exchange Canadian and American dollars, as well as euros for CUP at:

* the money exchange bureaus in Cuba’s international airports
* banks
* major hotels
* official exchange bureaus

It’s illegal to change money on the street or anywhere else other than authorized entities.

You cannot go through Cuban customs with more than 5 000 CUP.
