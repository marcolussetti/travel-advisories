## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Transfer to a Canadian prison

A criminal conviction may lead to a jail sentence. Canadian citizenship confers no immunity, special protection or rights to preferential treatment.

If a jail sentence is imposed, it will be served in a Cuban prison, unless a request for a transfer to a Canadian prison is approved by Cuba and Canada. Both countries have signed a treaty that permits a Canadian imprisoned in Cuba to request a transfer to complete the sentence in a Canadian prison.

### Criminal justice system

The criminal justice system in Cuba differs significantly from that in Canada. Charges are not laid until an investigation is complete. If you’re arrested in Cuba, you will likely be detained during the entire period of investigation. You should expect long delays to resolve your case. You will not be allowed to leave the country during this period.

Cuba’s constitution allows the death penalty, but since 2003, the country has effectively had a moratorium on carrying out death sentences.

### Money

The currency of Cuba is the Cuban peso (CUP).

Credit cards issued by U.S. financial institutions or affiliated with U.S. banks are not accepted in Cuba.

Canadian credit cards are increasingly accepted at restaurants and hotels. However, the system is unreliable, and bank cards may not work or may stop working without notice.

There are ATMs that accept certain cards, but they are unreliable and could have long lineups. Withdrawals are limited to 5,000 CUP.

Some banks, or state-run exchange bureaus, will allow cash withdrawal using credit and debit cards but will provide the cash in CUP only.

When travelling to Cuba, you should plan to bring enough cash to cover the duration of your stay. You should also plan for small banknotes to facilitate daily transactions such as street food, taxis, and tips.

You can easily exchange Canadian dollars and certain other major international currencies for CUP at:

* money exchange bureaus in Cuba’s international airports
* banks
* major hotels
* official exchange bureaus

It’s illegal to change money on the street or anywhere else other than authorized entities.

### Investments

Private property rights in Cuba are strictly controlled. Only Cubans and permanent residents can buy a property in Cuba or register a privately owned vehicle. Be wary of strangers or acquaintances offering to purchase these items on your behalf. If you plan on making investments in Cuba, seek legal advice in Canada and Cuba before making commitments.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect lengthy prison sentences.

* Pack your own luggage and monitor it closely at all times
* Never transport other people’s packages, bags or suitcases

### Marriage

To get married in Cuba, all documents you submit must be translated into Spanish, certified, authenticated, and legalised by the Embassy of Cuba to Canada, in Ottawa. Consult the Embassy of Cuba to Canada if you wish to marry in Cuba, including to a Cuban national.

### Drones

Drones are prohibited.

They will be confiscated by the authorities upon entry.

### Photography

Professional photographers require a visa to work in Cuba. If you are traveling to Cuba to work as a photographer, you may need a permit to import your equipment.

It’s forbidden to photograph:

* military and police installations or personnel
* harbour, rail and airport facilities

Military zones and any other restricted or heavily guarded areas are not always identified.

### Identification

Local authorities may request to see your identification at any time. By law, you must always carry valid identification.

* Keep a photocopy of your passport in case it’s lost or seized
* Keep a digital copy of your identification and travel documents

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Cuba.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of Cuba, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Cuba.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Cuba by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Cuba to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Black market

Street vendors may offer you black-market goods, such as cigars, or ask to change dollars for Cuban currency.

Engaging in black-market transactions is illegal and can lead to difficulties with the Cuban authorities.

### Boat traffic

The U.S. government closely monitors boat traffic in the Straits of Florida. U.S. authorities will seize any vessel not bearing a licence from the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) if they believe it’s headed for Cuba.

Vessels registered in Canada are exempt from these restrictions, unless you dock your boat in Florida while en route from Canada to Cuba. If you dock your vessel in Florida before travelling to Cuba, you must follow the OFAC regulations.

If you travel by boat to Cuba from the U.S.:

* make sure to know the regulations related to docking and port controls
* expect thorough searches and interrogations

### Driving

#### Traffic accidents

Canadians have been arrested and detained due to traffic accidents.

Accidents resulting in injury or death are treated as crimes. The driver must prove their innocence. If you’re found responsible in a traffic accident resulting in serious injury or death, you could face up to 10 years in prison.

If you’re involved in an accident:

* do not leave the scene
* do not move your vehicle
* call the police

Car insurance is mandatory for foreign drivers and foreign-registered vehicles, but not for Cuban citizens. As a result, most local drivers don't have car insurance. You shouldn’t expect compensation for vehicle damage or personal injury from a Cuban driver following a car accident.

#### Vehicle rentals

Car insurance coverage in Cuba differs from that in Canada.

Rental agencies are government-controlled. If you’re found to be at fault in an accident, the rental agency will nullify your coverage and seek compensation to cover the cost of repairs.

Cuban authorities can prohibit you from leaving the country unless the rental agency receives payment or until all claims associated with an accident are settled.

Contract agreements don’t cover occasional drivers. As a result, the signatory is responsible for all people driving the vehicle.

* Be cautious if you rent a vehicle in Cuba
* Avoid renting a scooter because thieves target them, and you may be responsible for the cost of its replacement
* Make sure to obtain a receipt when returning a rental vehicle
