### Pre-travel vaccines and medications

When travelling in this destination, you might be at risk for diseases that can be prevented with vaccines or medications. Talk to a travel health care provider about which ones are right for you based on your travel plans.

The highlights below will also tell you if your destination may require that vaccine for entering or exiting.

Yellow Fever - Country Entry Requirements 

[Yellow fever](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/yellow-fever.html) is a disease caused by a flavivirus from the bite of an infected mosquito.

Travellers get vaccinated either because it is required to enter a country or because it is recommended for their protection.

**Risk**

* There is no risk of yellow fever in this country.

**Country Entry Requirement\***

* Proof of vaccination is required if you are coming from or have transited through an airport of a country [where yellow fever occurs](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission-and-countries-requiring-yellow-fever-vaccination-(november-2022)).

**Recommendation**

* Vaccination is not recommended.
* Discuss travel plans, activities, and destinations with a health care professional.
* Contact a designated [Yellow Fever Vaccination Centre](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/travel-health/yellow-fever.html#select-centre%20) well in advance of your trip to arrange for vaccination.

[About Yellow Fever](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/yellow-fever.html "Link to External Site")

[Yellow Fever Vaccination Centres in Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/travel-health/yellow-fever.html#select-centre%20)  
\* It is important to note that [country entry requirements](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/vaccination-requirements-and-recommendations-for-international-travellers-and-malaria-situation-per-country-2022-edition "Link to External Site") may not reflect your risk of yellow fever at your destination. It is recommended that you contact the nearest [diplomatic or consular office](http://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?view=d "Link to External Site") of the destination(s) you will be visiting to verify any additional entry requirements.

Hepatitis A

There is a risk of [hepatitis A](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/hepatitis-a.html) in this destination. It is a disease of the liver. People can get hepatitis A if they ingest contaminated food or water, eat foods prepared by an infectious person, or if they have close physical contact (such as oral-anal sex) with an infectious person, although casual contact among people does not spread the virus.

Practise [safe food and water precautions](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/food-water) and wash your hands often. Vaccination is recommended for all travellers to areas where hepatitis A is present.

Hepatitis B

[Hepatitis B](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/hepatitis-b.html) is a risk in every destination. It is a viral liver disease that is easily transmitted from one person to another through exposure to blood and body fluids containing the hepatitis B virus.  Travellers who may be exposed to blood or other bodily fluids (e.g., through sexual contact, medical treatment, sharing needles, tattooing, acupuncture or occupational exposure) are at higher risk of getting hepatitis B.

Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all travellers. [Prevent hepatitis B](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/hepatitis-b/prevention-risks.html#a2) infection by practicing safe sex, only using new and sterile drug equipment, and only getting tattoos and piercings in settings that follow public health regulations and standards.

Measles 

Measles is a serious viral infection that spreads easily. It spreads through the air, and can stay in the air for up to 2 hours. You can also get measles by direct contact with an infected person or by touching a surface with the virus on it and then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth before washing your hands.

Getting vaccinated is the best way to protect yourself and others from measles. In Canada, the measles vaccine is part of the routine immunization schedule. If you’re unsure whether you’re protected, talk to a healthcare provider.

Japanese encephalitis

[Japanese encephalitis](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/japanese-encephalitis.html) is a viral infection that can cause swelling of the brain.  It is spread to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito. Risk is very low for most travellers. Travellers at relatively higher risk may want to consider vaccination for JE prior to travelling.

Travellers are at higher risk if they will be:

* travelling long term (e.g. more than 30 days)
* making multiple trips to endemic areas
* staying for extended periods in rural areas
* visiting an area suffering a JE outbreak
* engaging in activities involving high contact with mosquitos (e.g., entomologists)
COVID-19

COVID-19 is an infectious viral disease. Most of the time, it spreads when people are in close contact with others who are infected with the virus. It spreads through respiratory particles, or through an infected surface or object.

Vaccination is one of the most important ways to protect yourself from developing serious complications from COVID-19. Talk to a healthcare provider about the COVID-19 vaccine before travelling. Evidence shows that the COVID-19 vaccines used in Canada are very effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19.

In addition to vaccination, use personal protective measures to help protect yourself and others.

[COVID-19: Spread, prevention and risks](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks.html#p)

Influenza

 The best way to protect yourself from seasonal [influenza](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/flu-influenza.html) (flu) is to get vaccinated every year. [Get the flu shot](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/flu-influenza/get-your-flu-shot.html) at least 2 weeks before travelling.

 The flu occurs worldwide.

* In the Northern Hemisphere, the flu season usually runs from November to   April.
* In the Southern Hemisphere, the flu season usually runs between April and   October.
* In the tropics, there is flu activity year round.

The flu vaccine available in one hemisphere may only offer partial protection against the flu in the other hemisphere.

The flu virus spreads from person to person when they cough or sneeze or by touching objects and surfaces that have been contaminated with the virus. Clean your hands often and wear a mask if you have a fever or respiratory symptoms.

Typhoid 

[Typhoid](http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/diseases/typhoid) is a bacterial infection spread by contaminated food or water. Travellers going to countries in South Asia should speak to a health care professional about getting vaccinated.

Malaria 

[Malaria](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/malaria.html) is a serious and sometimes fatal disease that is caused by parasites spread through the bites of mosquitoes.  
   
**There is a risk of malaria in certain areas and/or during a certain time of year in this destination.**

[Antimalarial medication may be recommended](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/catmat/appendix-1-malaria-risk-recommended-chemoprophylaxis-geographic-area.html) depending on your itinerary and the time of year you are travelling. Consult a health care professional or visit a travel health clinic before travelling to discuss your options. It is recommended to do this 6 weeks before travel, however, it is still a good idea any time before leaving.   
   
[Protect yourself from mosquito bites](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/insect-bite-prevention.html) at all times:   
• Cover your skin and use an [approved](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/about-pesticides/insect-repellents.html) insect repellent on uncovered skin.   
• Exclude mosquitoes from your living area with screening and/or closed, well-sealed doors and windows.

Rabies 

In this destination, [rabies](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/diseases/rabies) is commonly carried by dogs and some wildlife, including bats. Rabies is a deadly disease that spreads to humans primarily through bites or scratches from an infected animal. While travelling, take [precautions](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/rabies/prevention.html), including keeping your distance from animals (including free-roaming dogs), and closely supervising children.

If you are bitten or scratched by a dog or other animal while travelling, immediately wash the wound with soap and clean water and see a health care professional. **In this destination, rabies treatment may be limited or may not be available, therefore you may need to return to Canada for treatment.**

Before travel, discuss rabies vaccination with a health care professional. It may be recommended for travellers who are at high risk of exposure (e.g., occupational risk such as veterinarians and wildlife workers, children, adventure travellers and spelunkers, and others in close contact with animals).

### Safe food and water precautions

Eating or drinking unsafe food or water, or swimming in contaminated water can make you sick while travelling. Take precautions by following these tips:

* Boil it, cook it, peel it, or leave it (only eat food that is prepared safely)
* Avoid, if possible, getting water in your eyes, mouth, or nose when swimming in freshwater (like streams, lakes, or canals), especially after heavy rain or flooding - the water might look clean but can still be contaminated
* Don’t swallow water when bathing, showering, swimming in pools, or using hot tubs

[Eat and drink safely abroad](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/food-water)

Cholera

**Risk**

[Cholera](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/cholera.html) is a risk in parts of this country. Most travellers are at very low risk.

To protect against cholera, all travellers should practise [safe food and water precautions](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/food-water).

Travellers at higher risk of getting cholera include those:

* visiting, working or living in areas with limited access to safe food, water and proper sanitation
* visiting areas where outbreaks are occurring

Vaccination may be recommended for high-risk travellers, and should be discussed with a health care professional.

Travellers' diarrhea

[Travellers' diarrhea](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/diarrhea.html) is the most common illness affecting travellers. It is spread from eating or drinking contaminated food or water.

Risk of developing travellers' diarrhea increases when travelling in regions with poor standards of hygiene and sanitation. Practise safe food and water precautions.

The most important treatment for travellers' diarrhea is rehydration (drinking lots of fluids). Carry oral rehydration salts when travelling.

Typhoid 

[Typhoid](http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/diseases/typhoid) is a bacterial infection spread by contaminated food or water. Risk is higher among children, travellers going to rural areas, travellers visiting friends and relatives or those travelling for a long period of time.

Travellers visiting regions with a risk of typhoid, especially those exposed to places with poor sanitation, should speak to a health care professional about vaccination.

### Tick and insect bite prevention

Many diseases are spread by bites from infected ticks and insects like mosquitoes, fleas, or flies. Before you travel, find out what types of ticks or insects are in the area, when they’re most active, and what diseases they can spread.

To protect yourself from bites:

* use an approved bug spray (insect repellent) on exposed skin
* wear light-coloured, loose clothing made of tightly woven materials like nylon or polyester
* wear socks and closed-toe shoes
* sleep under mosquito netting if you’re outdoors or staying in places that aren’t fully enclosed
* do a full body tick check on yourself, your children, your gear, and any pets you’re travelling with when you return from outdoor activities

[Personal insect repellents](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/about-pesticides/insect-repellents.html)

Chikungunya

There is a risk of chikungunya in this country. The level of risk may vary by:

* season
* year
* region
* elevation

The virus that causes chikungunya is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. It can cause fever and pain in the joints. In some cases, the joint pain can be severe and last for months or years.

Protect yourself from mosquito bites at all times.

[Insect bite and pest prevention](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/insect-bite-prevention.html)

A vaccine for the prevention of chikungunya is approved in Canada. Talk to your healthcare provider about how best to prevent chikungunya, including the benefits and risks of vaccination based on factors such as your age, itinerary and personal preferences.

Zika virus 

[Zika virus](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/zika-virus.html) is a risk in this country.

Zika virus is primarily spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. It can also be sexually transmitted. Zika virus can cause serious birth defects.

During your trip:

* [Prevent mosquito bites](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/insect-bite-prevention.html) at all times.
* Use condoms correctly or avoid sexual contact, particularly if you are pregnant.

If you are pregnant or planning a pregnancy, you should discuss the potential risks of travelling to this destination with your health care provider. You may choose to avoid or postpone travel.

For more information, see [Zika virus: Pregnant or planning a pregnancy.](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/zika-virus/pregnant-planning-pregnancy.html)

### Animal precautions

Some infections can spread directly from animals to people, like rabies or bird flu (avian influenza). Others don’t spread directly from animals but can infect people who visit areas animals have contaminated with their droppings or body fluids.

Certain activities can increase your chances of coming into contact with animals, their droppings, or their body fluids, like:

* travelling in rural or forested areas
* camping, hiking, or visiting caves
* visiting places where live animals are sold or killed for food, like wet markets

To reduce your risk of getting sick:

* avoid contact with animals like stray dogs, livestock (such as pigs and cows), monkeys, snakes, rodents, birds, and bats.
* stay away from places where animal waste can build up, such as caves
* avoid eating undercooked meat

Make sure to closely watch children; they are more likely to try to touch animals.

Avian Influenza

Human cases of avian influenza have been reported in this destination. [Avian influenza](http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/diseases/avian-influenza) is a viral infection that can spread quickly and easily among birds and in rare cases it can infect mammals, including people. The risk is low for most travellers.

Avoid contact with birds, including wild, farm, and backyard birds (alive or dead) and surfaces that may have bird droppings on them. Ensure all poultry dishes, including eggs and wild game, are properly cooked.

Travellers with a higher risk of exposure include those:

* visiting live bird/animal markets or poultry farms
* working with poultry (such as chickens, turkeys, domestic ducks)
* hunting, de-feathering, field dressing and butchering wild birds and wild mammals
* working with wild birds for activities such as research, conservation, or rehabilitation
* working with wild mammals, especially those that eat wild birds (e.g., foxes)

All eligible people are encouraged to get the seasonal influenza shot, which will protect them against human influenza viruses. While the seasonal influenza shot does not prevent infection with avian influenza, it can reduce the chance of getting sick with human and avian influenza viruses at the same time.

Nipah virus

There is a risk of Nipah virus infection in this country. Nipah virus infections can range from asymptomatic (no symptoms) to severe illness and death.

Nipah virus is spread to people from animals (such as fruit bats) but it can also be spread through contaminated food or close contact with someone who is ill.

Travellers to areas where Nipah virus is found should:

* avoid consuming date palm sap products, including raw date palm juice
* thoroughly wash and peel fruit before consumption
* wash hands regularly with soap and water
* discard fruit with signs of bites or fruit that has been found on the ground
* avoid contact with fruit bats and areas where they are known to roost

For more information on preventing Nipah virus infection, visit [Nipah virus: Prevention and risks](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/nipah/prevention-risks.html).

There is no vaccine or medication that protects against Nipah virus infection.

### Person-to-person infections

When travelling, you can reduce your risk of getting or spreading respiratory infections, like the flu or COVID-19, by:

* staying at your accommodation and limiting contact with others if you’re sick
* wearing a well-fitting mask, especially:   
  + if you’re sick and need to be around others
  + when you’re at large indoor events or in crowded settings, like sporting events, concerts, and airports
* cleaning your hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or using hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol
* covering your coughs and sneezes with a tissue or your elbow, not your hands

Tuberculosis

[Tuberculosis](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/tuberculosis.html) is an infection caused by bacteria and usually affects the lungs.

For most travellers the risk of tuberculosis is low.

Travellers who may be at high risk while travelling in regions with risk of tuberculosis should discuss pre- and post-travel options with a health care professional.

High-risk travellers include those visiting or working in prisons, refugee camps, homeless shelters, or hospitals, or travellers visiting friends and relatives.

### Medical services and facilities

Health care is inadequate. You will likely need medical evacuation to Singapore or Thailand in case of serious illness or injury.

You may have to pay in advance, in cash, to obtain medical services.

Medical evacuation can be very expensive.

Make sure you get travel insurance that includes coverage for medical evacuation and hospital stays.

[Health and safety outside Canada](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety)

### Keep in Mind...

The decision to travel is the sole responsibility of the traveller. The traveller is also responsible for his or her own personal safety.

Be prepared. Do not expect medical services to be the same as in Canada. Pack a [travel health kit](http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/kit), especially if you will be travelling away from major city centres.
