## Safety and security

### Security situation

In July 2024, widespread violence began in Bangladesh, resulting in thousands of deaths. Although the violent clashes have largely ended, the situation remains volatile.

If you are in Bangladesh, expect the following:

* a military presence in major city centres
* traffic delays and increased commuting times

### Chittagong Hill Tracts region

There is a serious risk of politically motivated violence, kidnapping and sporadic ethnic clashes in this region.

Violent clashes occur between indigenous communities that are organized under opposing political groups. The clashes result from their desire to obtain political control over specific geographic areas.

These groups also engage in extortion and drug, money and weapons smuggling.

If you decide to visit the Chittagong Hill Tracts region despite this advisory, you must contact the Chittagong Divisional Commissioner's Office at least 10 days before you arrive.

### Demonstrations and civil unrest

Demonstrations, blockades, nationwide general strikes—known as hartals—and politically motivated violence have occurred.

Sudden, potentially violent demonstrations and clashes can take place any day. Larger crowds usually gather on Friday afternoons following Jumma prayers. Previous violent protests have resulted in thousands of casualties.

Avoid all demonstrations and gatherings. Violence has occurred at rallies in several cities, including:

* Chittagong
* Dhaka
* Khulna
* Sylhet

Certain groups have used explosive devices and firearms during confrontations between rival political factions, demonstrators and police.

Be vigilant in Dhaka around:

* the National Parliament House and the Bangladesh Secretariat
* the Baitul Mukarram National Mosque
* the University of Dhaka
* the following districts:

+ Mirpur
+ Motijheel
+ Naya Paltan
+ Purana Paltan
+ Uttara
+ Dhanmondi
+ Mohammadpur
+ Shahbag

* the commercial district of Kawran Bazar

Attacks using explosive devices have occurred in crowded public places, hotels, movie theatres, public transportation and railway stations. Law enforcement officials have deployed crowd control measures such as tear gas and rubber bullets.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Southern Bangladesh

Bangladeshi authorities regulate access to areas in southern Bangladesh. Many Rohingya refugees have entered these areas, especially in the Ukhia and Teknaf sub-districts, in the south of Cox's Bazar district.

If you provide any humanitarian assistance in this region, make sure to do so through an established humanitarian agency that is registered with Bangladeshi authorities.

Stay informed on the ongoing situation.

#### Cox's Bazar

Public infrastructure in the Cox's Bazar area has severely degraded over the few past years. Resources such as basic food and potable water are limited.

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism throughout the country, especially in Dhaka. Extremists have carried out attacks using improvised explosive devices and suicide bombers. Westerners have been targeted. Although such incidences have been less frequent since 2020, smaller attacks and attempted attacks still occur.

Further attacks are likely. Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners
* police stations

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

Be particularly vigilant during religious holidays. Limit your attendance at events where a large number of people, including foreigners, may gather. These include:

* sporting events
* festivals
* public celebrations
* hotels and conference centres

Terrorists have used such occasions to mount attacks.

### Blockades

During blockades, protesters have set fire to vehicles and damaged railway tracks, leading to derailments and injuries.

* Avoid travelling during blockades, as attacks may occur
* Prepare to have sufficient food, water and fuel available, as there may be shortages

### General strikes

General strikes can effectively shut down all businesses and disrupt transportation, including in the diplomatic/expatriate areas. Passengers at Hazrat Shah Jalal International Airport may be stranded without transportation.

You may also have difficulty finding essential supplies such as fuel.

There is a high incidence of violence during these events.

During a general strike:

* avoid travelling within Dhaka, outside the Baridhara and Banani areas
* avoid all travel outside Dhaka

### Crime

#### Violent crime

Violent crime, such as armed robberies and rapes, occurs. During periods of civil unrest, there is potential for crimes of opportunity to increase.

Kidnappings for ransom have also occurred, though they rarely involve foreigners.

Religious minorities have been the targets of attacks. These minorities include:

* Hindus
* Buddhists
* Christians
* secular writers, including some foreigners

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing, purse snatching and mugging, are common, particularly in tourist areas.

* Avoid walking in public alone or after dark
* Avoid showing signs of affluence
* Do not wear jewellery
* Ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Decline help from anyone who approaches you at the airport with an offer to arrange transportation or assist with luggage

### Women's safety

Women travelling alone may face some forms of harassment and verbal abuse.

* Avoid travelling alone, including on public transportation, especially at night
* Don't go to the police station by yourself

### Forced marriage

Forced marriages affecting foreigners take place. Sometimes, the affected person doesn't know about or consent to the marriage.

Some Canadians could be forced into marital arrangements and detained against their will. They could be subjected to:

* threats
* intimidation
* violence by family members

Once you're abroad, your family members may retain your passport to prevent you from returning to Canada. Keep digital or physical copies of your travel documents in a safe place.

#### If you're in Canada

If you're in Canada and you believe that you're being forced to travel overseas to marry, call your local police for assistance.

#### If you're abroad

If you're abroad and you believe that you're being forced to marry, contact the nearest office of the Government of Canada. You may also contact the [Emergency Watch and Response Centre](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-assistance).

### Essential services and tourist facilities

Planned power cuts occur daily in most parts of the country and can last for many hours.

Water supplies are also inconsistent. Several areas of the country can go for days without any water.

Be aware that tourist facilities are inadequate throughout the country.

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety are poor throughout the country. Road travel is dangerous, particularly after dark. Many vehicles operate without headlights or with full high beams.

Traffic in urban areas is extremely congested and chaotic. Road accidents causing injuries or death are common. Crowds, which can turn hostile, often gather around the scene of such accidents.

In you are involved in a serious accident where you could be deemed at fault:

* immediately make your way to a police station
* lock your doors and windows and call police if you cannot move your vehicle

### Public transportation

Safety standards for public transportation, including buses, trains and ferries, are poor.

Thieves are present on trains, ferries and long-distance buses. They also target rickshaw, CNG (motorized rickshaw) and taxi passengers, particularly around dusk.

Be extremely cautious if using public transportation.

* Avoid travelling alone and after dark
* Use only registered taxis booked through a hotel

#### Buses

Buses are generally in poor condition. They are often involved in accidents.

#### Trains

Rail travel is slow and derailments occur. Trains are often overcrowded. Lock your compartment if you travel by train at night,

#### Ferries

Ferry accidents are common due to poor safety practices or extreme weather conditions.

If you choose to travel by ferry:

* make sure the vessel you are boarding is carrying appropriate safety equipment and that life jackets are provided for all passengers and accessible at all times
* don't board vessels that appear overloaded or unseaworthy
* verify the safety standards of ferries with your tour operator
