## Natural disasters and climate

### Climate change

Climate change is affecting Bangladesh. Extreme and unusual weather events are becoming more frequent. Monitor local news to stay informed on the current situation.

### Earthquakes and tsunamis

Bangladesh is located in an active seismic zone.

Bangladeshi authorities usually issue tsunami warnings immediately following a large earthquake.

A tsunami can occur within minutes of a nearby earthquake. However, the risk of tsunami can remain for several hours following the first tremor. If you're staying on the coast, familiarize yourself with the region's evacuation plans in the event of a tsunami warning.

In the event of an earthquake:

* monitor local media for the latest information
* follow the instructions of local authorities

### Monsoons and cyclones

The rainy (or monsoon) season extends from June to October. Every year during the monsoon season, a third of Bangladesh's territory is seriously affected. Seasonal flooding can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable and bridges damaged.

Bangladesh's coastline is also subject to cyclones. Heavy rain can cause flooding throughout the country, resulting in significant casualties and extensive damage to infrastructure.

If you decide to travel to Bangladesh during the rainy season:

* know that you expose yourself to serious safety risks
* be prepared to change your travel plans on short notice, including cutting short or cancelling your trip
* stay informed of the latest regional weather forecasts
* stay away from disaster areas
* carry emergency contact information for your airline or tour operator
* follow the advice and instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders

### Air pollution

Smoke haze and other types of air pollution can be extremely hazardous in urban areas and cities such as Dhaka. It's typically at its worst in winter. In rural areas, air quality can be affected by agricultural burning.

Monitor air pollution levels, which change quickly, especially if you suffer from respiratory ailments or have pre-existing medical conditions.

During periods of high air pollution:

* limit your activities outdoors
* monitor local media
* follow the instructions of local authorities
