### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Morocco. According to Moroccan law, however, Moroccan citizenship takes precedence over any other citizenship.

Airport authorities regularly ask dual citizens to produce their Moroccan national identification card.

If you’re a citizen of Canada, but also a citizen of Morocco, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited in Morocco. You may also be subject to different entry/exit requirements.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Morocco.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Morocco, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Moroccan court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Morocco to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Dress and behaviour

Islamic practices and beliefs are adhered to in Morocco’s customs, laws and regulations. Dress conservatively, behave discreetly and respect religious and social traditions to avoid offending local sensitivities.

Public displays of affection are frowned upon.

### Ramadan

In 2025, the lunar month of Ramadan is expected to begin on or around February 28.

In public, between sunrise and sunset, refrain from:

* drinking
* eating

### Money

The currency in Morocco is the Moroccan dirham (MAD). The dirham cannot be exchanged outside of the country. Exchange only as much money as needed, as it is illegal to take dirhams out of Morocco.

Unused dirhams can be converted at the airport exchange counter upon departure, with proof of your initial currency purchase.

Credit cards and traveller’s cheques are accepted in certain stores and restaurants in urban centres and in major hotels.
