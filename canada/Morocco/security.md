# Safety and security

## Safety and security

Since the end of September 2025, demonstrations have been occurring in various cities across the country. Violent incidents have also been reported in multiple locations. Avoid large gatherings and protests.

[More information on demonstrations](#demonstrations)

### Border regions

#### The Berm (border regions of Western Sahara)

A militarized boundary, known as the Berm, separates the Moroccan-controlled part of Western Sahara from the rest of the Saharan territory, which borders Algeria and Mauritania. There are fatalities involving unexploded ordnance in this zone each year.

#### Border with Algeria

Morocco’s border with Algeria is closed. Don’t attempt to cross into Algeria by land or water. Avoid boating close to the maritime border in order not to cross it.

#### Western Sahara

Western Sahara is a non-autonomous territory whose political and legal status has yet to be determined through the United Nations. It’s a former area of conflict that’s still littered with unexploded landmines, particularly in remote regions and the militarized zone.

We may be extremely limited in our ability to provide assistance to Canadians in Western Sahara.

#### Travel in remote areas

When you travel to a remote area:

* restrict travel to officially designated tourist areas
* seek local, official tourist advice prior to travelling to the desert areas in the south
* hire only official guides recommended by hotels, travel agencies or local tourist authorities
* use only a four-wheel-drive vehicle for off-road driving in the mountains or desert
* ensure that your vehicle is properly equipped and has appropriate supplies and essentials, including potable water

### Terrorism

There’s a threat of terrorism, and attacks have targeted foreigners. In December 2018, 2 Scandinavian tourists were found dead in a mountainous area of ​​southern Morocco, 10 km from Imlil, a village in the High Atlas. Moroccan authorities have described the killing as a terrorist act. Terrorist attacks could occur at any time.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels (specifically coastal beach resorts), and other sites frequented by foreigners

For your safety:

* always be aware of your surroundings when in public places
* stay at hotels that have robust security measures; keep in mind, however, that even the most secure locations can’t be considered completely free of risk

### Kidnapping

There’s a threat of kidnapping against Westerners in remote regions of Morocco and in areas bordering Algeria and Mauritania.

* Maintain a high level of vigilance at all times, especially when travelling in the southern and border areas of Morocco
* Don’t hike alone in remote mountain regions

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations occur occasionally, mostly near government buildings in Rabat, Casablanca and other major cities.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing, purse and drive-by snatching, scams and other types of thefts occur, especially in:

* medinas
* market areas
* parks
* beaches

During your trip:

* exercise caution
* stay on main roads, especially when in the medinas
* keep your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, in a secure place
* don’t show signs of affluence or wear expensive jewelry, especially after dark

#### Armed robbery

Armed robberies with knives have occurred and have resulted in injuries and in some cases, deaths. Don’t resist robbers.

#### Credit and debit card fraud and thefts from ATMs

Credit and debit card fraud, as well as thefts from ATMs occur frequently.

When using your debit or credit card and ATMs:

* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety vary greatly throughout the country, depending on location and weather (for example, in the mountains or during the rainy season).

* Avoid driving at night
* Have an accident report form (constat à l’amiable), which can be purchased at newsstands, in your vehicle at all times.

#### Risks

Not all drivers respect traffic regulations. Pedestrians, scooters and animals on roadways can also pose risks.

#### National roads

National roads are generally in good condition but are narrow and heavily congested.

#### Highways

Driving is generally easier on the highways.

Be extremely careful when driving on the Rabat-Casablanca highway and on certain national highways because of high traffic volume.

#### Accidents

Accidents causing fatalities are common.

If an accident occurs and only involves material damage, the police won’t usually intervene. The parties involved should complete an accident report (joint report), which can be purchased at newsstands. If the accident involves casualties, avoid moving the vehicles before the police arrive.

#### Checkpoints

Checkpoints are frequent. Carry your identification and vehicle documents at all times.

### Air travel

We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.

### Internet romances

Find out beforehand about the country’s customs and laws on conjugal relations and marriage.

Ensure that you retain possession of your return plane ticket, your money and your passport in case problems arise.

### Public beaches

While swimming conditions in tourist areas are generally safe and problem-free, public beaches in major cities are often polluted and unfit for swimming.

Swimming at some beaches on the Atlantic coast is dangerous due to strong currents and tides. Only swim at designated beaches and exercise caution.

Women and girls can be the subject of harassment when wearing swimsuits. Exercise caution and opt for tourist beaches rather than the public ones.
