You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect heavy fines and lengthy prison sentences, which must be served in Guyana.

### Imports and exports

The importation/exportation of restricted items, including firearms and ammunition, without the proper permits may result in heavy fines and prison sentences.

Many birds are protected species. You may not export an exotic bird unless you have been a legal resident of Guyana for at least a year and received permission from the Ministry of Agriculture.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Guyana law prohibits sexual acts between individuals of the same sex and other related offences include being in a same-sex marriage and promoting homosexuality.

Those convicted can face jail sentences.

2SLGBTQI+ persons should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Guyana.

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Guyana.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Guyana, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Guyana.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Guyana by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Guyana to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Driving

Vehicles drive on the left.

You should carry an international driving permit (IDP). If you cannot obtain an IDP before leaving Canada, you may apply for a local permit based on a valid Canadian driverâ€™s licence.

Penalties for drivers responsible for an accident causing injury or death are severe and may include imprisonment. Ensure you have sufficient insurance coverage to drive in Guyana.

Only major hotels accept credit cards. There are a few ATMs that accept international bank cards.
