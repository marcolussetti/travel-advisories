# Safety and security

## Safety and security

Demonstrations are ongoing in Georgetown and in other locations across Guyana. Violent incidents have occurred.

[Demonstrations](#demonstrations)

### Border with Venezuela

There are no official border crossings with Venezuela. The security environment is volatile along the border between Guyana and Venezuela due to the ongoing discord over the Guyana Essequibo region and gang-related violence.

* Exercise a high degree of caution near the border with Venezuela
* Only use the official border crossings with Brazil and Suriname
* Monitor local media for the latest information
* Follow the instructions of local authorities and security forces

### Crime

#### Petty Crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs. Criminals target foreigners and returning Guyanese citizens.

* Avoid showing signs of affluence.
* Ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times.

#### Violent Crime

Violent crime is prevalent across Guyana. It is often associated with illegal drug trafficking.  Homicides, assaults, break-ins, armed robberies, theft from cars and carjackings are common.

Criminals often travel in groups of two or more and often surveille their target for days prior to any confrontation.

Foreigners have been robbed at gunpoint and attacked after withdrawing money at banks, in shopping districts and in hotels.

* Avoid carrying large amounts of cash
* Do not change money in the street with street changers

Exercise increased caution in Georgetown, particularly in the following neighbourhoods:

* the area 2 km south of Brickdam Street
* Agricola
* Albouystown
* Albertown
* Bourda
* Buxton
* East Ruimveldt
* Sophia
* Stabroek
* Tiger Bay

To minimize the risk of violent crime:

* do not walk alone after dark
* avoid deserted or under-populated areas

### Ecotourism

If you intend to trek:

* never practice this activity alone and always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* ensure that you are properly equipped and well informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary, including when you expect to be back to camp
* know the symptoms of acute altitude sickness, which can be fatal
* obtain detailed information on trekking routes or ski slopes before setting out and do not venture off marked trails or slopes

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety are poor throughout the country. Roads are poorly lit and drivers do not respect traffic laws. Drinking and driving is prevalent. Roaming livestock pose further hazard. Accidents causing fatalities are common.

In the case of an accident, the law requires persons involved in a traffic accident to remain at the scene until the police arrive to take a report. Response time may be slow due to a lack of resources. Injured persons are frequently transported to hospitals or the nearest medical facility by bystanders, unless they are seriously injured. Local authorities are cooperative, but assistance is limited and may only be available during business hours.

Travel to the interior (also known as the hinterlands) is not safe due to low police presence.

* Travel in convoys, particularly when visiting the hinterlands
* Avoid driving at night

### Public transportation

#### Minibuses

Avoid using public minibuses, as they tend to be overloaded, poorly maintained and badly driven. Minibuses are often involved in accidents.

#### Taxis

Taxis are the safest means of transportation, however, robberies and assaults occasionally occur.

* Do not hail taxis from the roadside
* Only use taxis that are connected to major hotels or from a reputable company
* Make note of the vehicle’s licence plate before entering, in order to track down the driver in the event of overcharging or lost luggage

#### Water taxis

Avoid using water taxis to cross international waters. Use the scheduled ferry service, which has a formal border control check point.

### Piracy

Pirate attacks and armed robbery against ships occur in coastal waters. Mariners should take appropriate precautions.
