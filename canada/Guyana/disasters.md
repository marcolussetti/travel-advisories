## Natural disasters and climate

### Rainy seasons

There are two rainy seasons in Guyana: from May to July and from November to January. However, flooding occurs year round and can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services, particularly in coastal areas. Roads may become impassable and bridges damaged.

The coast of Guyana is below sea level and protected by a sea defence and dam system. Infrastructure, including drainage systems, is poorly maintained.

Monitor regional weather forecasts and plan accordingly.
