# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and bag snatching occurs sometimes across the country. Incidents are more frequent in Port Louis, Flic en Flac and Grand-Baie, especially at night.

Theft is frequent in:

* popular tourist areas, including markets and public beaches
* hotel rooms
* at or near street ATMs

During your trip to Mauritius:

* ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and your other travel documents are secure at all times
* avoid walking alone after dark
* pay attention to your surroundings, particularly in crowded and tourist areas
* be extra cautious when withdrawing cash from ATMs
* stay in accommodations that have adequate security measures and are registered with the Mauritius Tourism Authority

#### Violent crime

Although rare, violent crime has occurred, namely:

* assault
* burglary
* sexual assault
* murder

Tourists are usually not targeted; however, you could be at the wrong place at the wrong time.

During your trip:

* always be aware of your surroundings, at all times
* avoid poorly lit and isolated areas
* if you're robbed, hand over cash, electronic devices and valuables without resistance

### Road safety

Road safety can vary considerably across the country.

Accidents are frequent.

#### Road conditions

Road conditions vary across the country. Some roads are narrow, uneven and poorly lit. Many are bordered by deep ditches and lack guardrails.

Driving can also be dangerous due to:

* stray livestock
* lack of traffic signs
* presence of pedestrians on the road
* drivers not using headlights or using high beams

#### Driving habits

Local driving habits may pose risks. Drivers don’t always respect traffic laws and can be reckless.

Emergency and roadside assistance is limited.

If you chose to drive:

* always drive defensively
* plan your trip in advance, especially if you are visiting a rural area
* ask about insurance coverage options for roadside assistance when you rent a vehicle

### Water activities

Certain coastal waters are prone to riptides.

Stonefish stings are unusual but can be fatal.

Aquatic equipment offered at the beach may not meet international safety standards.

* Ensure that your travel insurance covers accidents related to recreational activities
* Respect the areas reserved for swimming
* Always maintain a safe distance from boats and restricted areas
* Always respect warning flags advising of dangerous conditions
* Consult residents and tour operators for information on possible hazards and safe swimming areas
* Ask about the presence of dangerous species
* Wear swimming shoes to protect yourself from reefs, rocks, corals or sea species

### Public transportation

Public transportation is reliable across the country.

The light rail service from Port Louis to Curepipe is safe and convenient.

Buses and taxis are available between cities and remote areas. Ride-sharing apps are also available.

Most taxis don’t have meters.

* Only use registered taxis
* Negotiate the fare in advance and ensure that the amount appearing on the receipt matches the fare

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations occur, and even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation. Authorities may restrict movement without notice. Telecommunication and Internet access may also be disrupted.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations
