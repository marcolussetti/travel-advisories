## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Transfer to a Canadian prison

Canada and The Bahamas are signatories to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in The Bahamas to request a transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both Canadian and Bahamian authorities.

This process can take a long time, and there is no guarantee that the transfer will be approved by either or both sides.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect jail sentences and heavy fines.

* Pack your own luggage and monitor it closely at all times
* Never transport other people’s packages, bags or suitcases

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Bahamian law does not prohibit sexual acts between individuals of the same sex. However, the legal age for sexual relations is 18 years old.

Homosexuality is not widely socially accepted. 2SLGBTQI+ persons could be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or sex characteristics.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in The Bahamas.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of The Bahamas, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and The Bahamas.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in The Bahamas, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Bahamian court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in The Bahamas to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Investments

Disputes related to property acquisition or other investments are costly and take time to resolve.

If you plan to buy property or make other investments in The Bahamas:

* seek legal advice in Canada and in The Bahamas before making commitments
* choose your own lawyer
* avoid hiring a lawyer recommended by a seller

In case of an accident, you must remain at the scene and not move your vehicle until the police arrive.

You should carry an International Driving Permit.
