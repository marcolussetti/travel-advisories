## Safety and security

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and bag snatching, may occur in tourist areas.

Robberies also occur in cruise ship terminals and in and around popular resort areas in Nassau and Freeport, even in daylight hours. Crime increases during the holidays, festivals and regattas.

During your trip:

* keep your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, in a secure place
* do not show signs of affluence or wear expensive jewellery
* do not carry large sums of cash or valuables unnecessarily
* be extra cautious when withdrawing cash from ATMs

#### Violent crime

Violent crime occurs and is often related to gang activity. Most crime occurs on the islands of New Providence and Grand Bahama. The Bahamas has a high murder rate, but incidents mostly occur in downtown Nassau in non-tourist areas after dark. High incidences of violent crime occur in neighbourhoods outside of high tourist areas.

The most common crimes committed against travellers in Nassau and Freeport are:

* armed robberies
* burglaries
* fraud
* sexual assaults
* theft

There is an increase in break-ins and theft. Do not exit your vehicle to remove objects blocking the road, as robberies and carjackings can take place.

During your trip:

* always remain vigilant
* stay in tourist areas
* avoid isolated areas, including beaches, especially at night
* keep your doors and windows locked
* avoid walking alone after dark
* be wary of strangers offering to help you
* if you're threatened by armed criminals, stay calm and do not resist

### Women’s safety

While you’re in The Bahamas:

* exercise caution at all times, especially during jet ski rides
* avoid walking alone after dark
* avoid unattended beaches
* do not accept offers of transportation from strangers
* do not accept drinks or drugs from strangers

* cigarettes

Incidents are most likely to occur:

* on beaches
* in casinos

### Swimming

Across The Bahamas, sharks pose a risk to swimmers. Do not swim in waters where fishermen use bait to attract marine life.

* Consult residents and tour operators for information on possible hazards, the presence of dangerous species and safe swimming areas
* Keep a safe distance from areas reserved for recreational boating

### Water activities

The water sports rental industry is poorly regulated and reputable operators are limited. Boating accidents occur frequently, particularly on jet skis.

* Only rent water sports equipment from reputable registered operators
* Insist on proper training before using the equipment

### Power outages and water shortages

Power outages occur frequently and water shortages occur occasionally, during and after hurricanes.

Local authorities may limit electricity usage and impose water rationing measures.

Power outages and rationing could impact essential services, such as:

* transportation
* power distribution
* water and food supply
* telecommunications networks
* emergency services
* medical care
* banking transactions
* the supply of basic necessities

Not all buildings are equipped with generators and drinking water may be difficult to find.

* Keep a supply of water, food, fuel and an emergency kit on hand
* Monitor local media for the latest information

### Roads

#### Road safety

Fatal accidents are very frequent. Fatal accidents involving pedestrians are common on New Providence Island.

There is severe traffic congestion in Nassau and drivers are often reckless in traffic.

Road construction is not always well marked.

Bicycles, mopeds, four wheelers and pedestrians can be hazards, particularly on the busy streets of Nassau and Freeport.

* Keep your car doors locked and your windows rolled up
* Never get out of your car to remove objects blocking the road, as this could be a ploy by armed assailants to rob you
* Do not leave valuables within reach or in plain sight

#### Road conditions

Roads are generally in good condition in and around major cities, but in rural areas, they are poorly maintained and dangerous due to:

* traffic jams and heavy traffic
* narrow and winding roads
* poorly marked construction sites
* flooding
* various hazards on the road
* insufficient lighting

#### Driving habits

Drivers don’t always respect traffic laws. Drinking and driving is prevalent. Always drive defensively.

### Public transportation

Pickpocketing may occur on public transportation.

#### Minibuses

After dark, avoid travelling on local minibuses on routes outside of the main tourist areas.

#### Taxis

Taxis don’t use meters. There are standard taxi fares based on zones.

* Only use officially marked taxis with “TN” on yellow license plates
* Confirm the fare in advance
* Never share a taxi with strangers
