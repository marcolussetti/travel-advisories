## Safety and security

### Crime

Violent crime is low. Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, is common.

Organized groups of pickpockets often use distraction techniques and are particularly active in:

* main cities, including Prague
* public transportation hubs, including Prague main railway station (Praha hlavní nádraží)
* hotel lobbies
* restaurants, patios and outdoor cafés
* tourist attractions

Car thefts and break-ins are common, particularly in major cities.

Gangs of thieves may use jostling and swarming techniques to rob your belongings. They often target subway stations, particularly:

* Malostranská
* Můstek
* Muzeum
* Staromĕstská

They also target tram routes, such as:

* tram 22, which runs to and from Prague Castle
* the tourist trams 41, 42 and 43

Robberies also occur on overnight trains.

While in Czechia:

* ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* avoid showing signs of affluence and carrying large sums of cash
* carry a photocopy or digital copy of your passport identification page, driver’s license, train or airline tickets and credit cards
* don’t leave luggage unattended at airport check-in or ticket counters, car rental desks or hotel lobbies
* don’t leave luggage or valuables in a vehicle, and always park your vehicle in secure facilities
* be cautious when travelling on public transportation and overnight trains

#### Reporting a crime

If you are a victim of a crime, you should go to the nearest police station to report it. In Prague, a 24-hour police station dedicated to assistance to foreign victims of crime is located at Jungmannovo náměstí 9, near the Můstek metro station.

Keep a copy of your report, as you may need to make a claim to your insurance provider.

### Spiked food and drinks

Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as the items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

### Fraud

#### Scams

Individuals posing as plainclothes police officers may ask to see your foreign currency and passports. Politely decline to cooperate, but offer to go to the nearest police station.

Some bars, restaurants and nightclubs may try to charge exorbitant prices or overcharge you.

* Be cautious of unsolicited requests from strangers
* Always confirm prices before consuming
* Check your bill to make sure it’s exact
* Avoid running a tab or leaving your credit card with bar or restaurant staff

#### Credit card and ATM fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud occurs.

When using debit or credit cards:

* pay careful attention if other people are handling your cards
* use ATMs located in public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transaction on your account statements

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in Europe. Terrorists have carried out attacks in several European cities.

Terrorist attacks could occur at any time.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places. Be particularly vigilant if attending sporting events and during religious holidays and other public celebrations, as terrorists have used such occasions to mount attacks.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations take place regularly. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety can vary greatly throughout the country. Roads in rural or mountainous areas may be uneven, narrow, under construction or poorly marked.

Drivers often drive at excessive speeds.

### Public transportation

#### Tramways

Trams have priority over all types of transport and pedestrians.

Always be alert when walking, driving or cycling near tram rails.

#### Trains

Czechia has an extensive passenger train system. Rail accidents occur.

#### Taxis

In Prague, you can get a taxi at the stands. They are regulated by the city government.

To avoid being overcharged:

* avoid hailing taxis on the street
* negotiate fares in advance, or insist that the driver use the meter
* use only officially marked taxis, reputable taxi companies or a trusted ride-sharing app
