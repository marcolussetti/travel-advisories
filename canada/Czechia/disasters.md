### Flooding and landslides

Heavy rains, particularly during spring and summer, can cause flooding and landslides. Roads may become impassable and infrastructure damaged.

Flooding in September 2024 caused significant damage, particularly in the Moravian-Silesian region. Certain rail lines and roads remain closed.

* Exercise caution, particularly in areas around major rivers
* Stay informed of the latest regional weather forecasts
* Follow the advice of local authorities, including evacuation orders

### Tornadoes

Although rare, tornadoes may occur during summer. In June 2021, a powerful tornado caused widespread damage in South Moravia.

### Wildfires

Forest fires may occur. The air quality in areas near active fires may deteriorate due to heavy smoke.

In case of a significant fire:

* stay away from affected areas, particularly if you suffer from respiratory ailments
* monitor local media for up-to-date information on the situation
* follow the advice of local authorities
