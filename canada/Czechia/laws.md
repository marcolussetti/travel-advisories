## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Transfer to a Canadian prison

Canada and Czechia are signatories to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in Czechia to request a transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both Canadian and Czechia authorities.

This process can take a long time, and there is no guarantee that the transfer will be approved by either or both sides.

### Identification

Local police may ask for your identification at any time.

* Carry your passport at all times
* Keep a photocopy or a digital copy in a safe place, in case it is lost or stolen

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect jail sentences or heavy fines.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Czechia.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Czechia, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Czechia.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Czechia, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Czech court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Czechia to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Pedestrian traffic laws

Local authorities may fine pedestrians for violations such as jaywalking, crossing the street on a red light, or crossing the roadway at a non-designated location, particularly in Prague’s city centre.

Trams have the right of way over pedestrians, including at pedestrian crossings.

### Public transportation

Before using public transportation, you must validate your ticket by using machines located on board or in the station.

You will receive a fine requiring immediate payment if an inspector carries out an inspection and:

* you don’t have a ticket
* your ticket has not been validated
* your ticket has expired

### Money

The currency of Czechia is the Czech koruna (CZK).

Non-official currency exchange is illegal. Plus, you are at risk of receiving counterfeit bills.

* Never exchange money with vendors on the street
* Use official exchange offices or banks only

If you are carrying €10,000 or more, or the equivalent in other currencies or monetary instruments, you must make a declaration to customs when you enter or leave the European Union.

This does not apply if you are travelling within the European Union or in transit to a non-EU country.
