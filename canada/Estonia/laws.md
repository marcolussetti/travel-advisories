## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Transfer to a Canadian prison

Canada and Estonia are signatories to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in Estonia to request a transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both Canadian and Estonian authorities.

This process can take a long time, and there is no guarantee that the transfer will be approved by either or both sides.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect prison sentences or heavy fines.

### Identification

You must always carry photo identification, such as a passport, as local authorities can ask you to prove your identity.

Keep a photocopy of your passport in a safe place in case it’s lost or seized.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Estonia.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of Estonia, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Estonia.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Estonia, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Estonian court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Estonia to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Reflective items

Pedestrians must wear small reflectors from dusk until dawn. You can buy reflectors at most stores. They are usually pinned to coats or bags. Reflective vests, clothing, and accessories are also permitted. Reflectors or reflective items must be visible to drivers.

You could be fined for failure to wear a reflector, particularly if an accident occurs.

### Drones

Estonian and European laws regulate recreational and commercial drone operation.

You must register as a drone operator and apply for authorisation with the Estonian authorities. Depending on the size of your drone and the intended use, you may also need to take a proof of competency exam.

Certain areas are restricted or off limits for personal drones. These include:

* military sites
* certain nature conservation areas
* areas within 5 km of airports

If you don’t comply with these laws, your drone could be confiscated and you could face heavy fines, arrest and detention. You could also be deported and banned from the entire Schengen area.

### Driving

You can drive in Estonia with your valid Canadian driver’s licence for up to 12 months.

Penalties for drinking and driving are severe. Estonia has a zero-tolerance policy for drinking and driving. If a police officer suspects you of drinking and driving, they could confiscate your driver’s license on the spot. If you’re convicted, you can expect heavy fines and possible jail time.

If you are involved in an accident, you must contact the police to file an official report.

Police sometimes set up checkpoints on major roads. Foreign-registered vehicles are subject to strict regulations. When driving, you should always carry your original registration documents.

### Money

The currency of Estonia is the euro (EUR).

If you are carrying €10,000 or more, or the equivalent in other currencies or monetary instruments, you must make a declaration to customs when you enter or leave the European Union.

This does not apply if you are travelling within the European Union or in transit to a non-EU country.
