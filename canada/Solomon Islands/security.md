### Water activities

#### Swimming

Beaches are not usually supervised by lifeguards. Tidal changes can cause powerful currents in the coastal lagoons that surround the islands. Riptides are common. Several drownings occur each year.

Rescue services may not be consistent with international standards.

* Consult residents and tour operators for information on possible hazards and safe swimming areas

Tour operators may not adhere to international standards.

If you undertake adventure sports, such as diving:

If in doubt concerning the safety of the facilities or equipment, don’t use them.
