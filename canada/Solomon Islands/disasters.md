### Monsoons and cyclones

Monsoon rains and cyclones in the South Pacific usually occur from November to May. During this period, even small storms can quickly develop into major cyclones.

These severe storms can put you at risk and hamper the provision of essential services.

* know that you may expose yourself to serious safety risks
* be prepared to change your travel plans on short notice, including cutting short or cancelling your trip
* stay informed of the latest regional weather forecasts
* carry emergency contact information for your airline or tour operator
* follow the advice and instructions of local authorities

### Earthquakes and tsunamis

The Solomon Islands are in an active seismic zone. Earthquakes and tsunamis occur.

A tsunami can occur within minutes of a nearby earthquake. However, the risk of tsunami can remain for several hours following the first tremor. If you’re in the Solomon Islands, familiarize yourself with the region’s evacuation plans in the event of a tsunami warning.
