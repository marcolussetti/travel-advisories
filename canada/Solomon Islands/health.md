### Pre-travel vaccines and medications

When travelling in this destination, you might be at risk for diseases that can be prevented with vaccines or medications. Talk to a travel health care provider about which ones are right for you based on your travel plans.

The highlights below will also tell you if your destination may require that vaccine for entering or exiting.

Yellow Fever - Country Entry Requirements 

[Yellow fever](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/yellow-fever.html) is a disease caused by a flavivirus from the bite of an infected mosquito.

Travellers get vaccinated either because it is required to enter a country or because it is recommended for their protection.

**Risk**

* There is no risk of yellow fever in this country.

**Country Entry Requirement\***

* Proof of vaccination is required if you are coming from a country [where yellow fever occurs.](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission-and-countries-requiring-yellow-fever-vaccination-(november-2022))

**Recommendation**

* Vaccination is not recommended.
* Discuss travel plans, activities, and destinations with a health care professional.
* Contact a designated [Yellow Fever Vaccination Centre](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/travel-health/yellow-fever.html#select-centre) well in advance of your trip to arrange for vaccination.

[About Yellow Fever](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/yellow-fever.html "Link to External Site")

[Yellow Fever Vaccination Centre](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/travel-health/yellow-fever.html#select-centre )

\* It is important to note that [country entry requirements](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/vaccination-requirements-and-recommendations-for-international-travellers-and-malaria-situation-per-country-2022-edition "Link to External Site") may not reflect your risk of yellow fever at your destination. It is recommended that you contact the nearest [diplomatic or consular office](http://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?view=d "Link to External Site") of the destination(s) you will be visiting to verify any additional entry requirements.

Hepatitis A

There is a risk of [hepatitis A](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/hepatitis-a.html) in this destination. It is a disease of the liver. People can get hepatitis A if they ingest contaminated food or water, eat foods prepared by an infectious person, or if they have close physical contact (such as oral-anal sex) with an infectious person, although casual contact among people does not spread the virus.

Practise [safe food and water precautions](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/food-water) and wash your hands often. Vaccination is recommended for all travellers to areas where hepatitis A is present.

Malaria 

[Malaria](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/malaria.html) is a serious and sometimes fatal disease that is caused by parasites spread through the bites of mosquitoes.

**Malaria is a risk to travellers to this destination.**  
   
[Antimalarial medication is recommended](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/catmat/appendix-1-malaria-risk-recommended-chemoprophylaxis-geographic-area.html) for most travellers to this destination and should be taken as recommended. Consult a health care professional or visit a travel health clinic before travelling to discuss your options. It is recommended to do this 6 weeks before travel, however, it is still a good idea any time before leaving. 

* Cover your skin and use an [approved](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/about-pesticides/insect-repellents.html) insect repellent on uncovered skin.
* Exclude mosquitoes from your living area with screening and/or closed, well-sealed doors and windows.
* Use insecticide-treated bed nets if mosquitoes cannot be excluded from your living area.
* Wear permethrin-treated clothing.

 If you develop [symptoms](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/malaria/symptoms-malaria.html) similar to malaria when you are travelling or up to a year after you return home, see a health care professional immediately. Tell them where you have been travelling or living.

Rabies 

In this destination, [rabies](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/diseases/rabies) may be present in some wildlife species, including bats. Rabies is a deadly disease that spreads to humans primarily through bites or scratches from an infected animal.

If you are bitten or scratched by an animal while travelling, immediately wash the wound with soap and clean water and see a health care professional.

Before travel, discuss rabies vaccination with a health care professional. It may be recommended for travellers who will be working directly with wildlife.

Japanese encephalitis

[Japanese encephalitis](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/japanese-encephalitis.html) is a viral infection that can cause swelling of the brain.  It is spread to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito. Risk is very low for most travellers. Travellers at relatively higher risk may want to consider vaccination for JE prior to travelling.

Travellers are at higher risk if they will be:

* travelling long term (e.g. more than 30 days)
* making multiple trips to endemic areas
* staying for extended periods in rural areas
* visiting an area suffering a JE outbreak
* engaging in activities involving high contact with mosquitos (e.g., entomologists)
Measles - Proof of vaccination 

[Measles](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/measles.html) is a highly contagious viral disease. It can spread quickly from person to person by direct contact and through droplets in the air.

Anyone who is not protected against measles is at risk of being infected with it when travelling internationally.

Regardless of where you are going, talk to a health care professional before travelling to make sure you are fully protected against measles.

**Proof of vaccination:**

Travellers arriving to the Solomon Islands from American Samoa, Samoa, Fiji, Tonga, Australia, New Zealand and the Philippines are required to provide certified proof of measles vaccination 3 weeks prior to their arrival date. Failure to produce certified proof of vaccination will result in deportation.

These requirements are not applicable to infants less than 6 months of age, pregnant women, and persons carrying documentary evidence of contraindications for vaccine administration, such as immune-deficiency or allergies (certificate from doctor). Contact information: The Ministry of Health and Medical Services, Solomon Islands Government. Tel: (677) 23650.

To obtain proof of vaccination, contact your health care professional or your local public health authority.

Hepatitis B

[Hepatitis B](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/hepatitis-b.html) is a risk in every destination. It is a viral liver disease that is easily transmitted from one person to another through exposure to blood and body fluids containing the hepatitis B virus.  Travellers who may be exposed to blood or other bodily fluids (e.g., through sexual contact, medical treatment, sharing needles, tattooing, acupuncture or occupational exposure) are at higher risk of getting hepatitis B.

Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all travellers. [Prevent hepatitis B](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/hepatitis-b/prevention-risks.html#a2) infection by practicing safe sex, only using new and sterile drug equipment, and only getting tattoos and piercings in settings that follow public health regulations and standards.

COVID-19

[Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection.html) is an infectious viral disease. It can spread from person to person by direct contact and through droplets in the air.

It is recommended that all eligible travellers complete a COVID-19 vaccine series along with any additional recommended doses in Canada before travelling. Evidence shows that vaccines are very effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19. While vaccination provides better protection against serious illness, you may still be at risk of infection from the virus that causes COVID-19. Anyone who has not completed a vaccine series is at increased risk of being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and is at greater risk for severe disease when travelling internationally.

Before travelling, verify your destination’s COVID-19 vaccination entry/exit requirements. Regardless of where you are going, talk to a health care professional before travelling to make sure you are adequately protected against COVID-19.

Influenza

 The best way to protect yourself from seasonal [influenza](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/flu-influenza.html) (flu) is to get vaccinated every year. [Get the flu shot](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/flu-influenza/get-your-flu-shot.html) at least 2 weeks before travelling.

 The flu occurs worldwide.

* In the Northern Hemisphere, the flu season usually runs from November to   April.
* In the Southern Hemisphere, the flu season usually runs between April and   October.
* In the tropics, there is flu activity year round.

The flu vaccine available in one hemisphere may only offer partial protection against the flu in the other hemisphere.

The flu virus spreads from person to person when they cough or sneeze or by touching objects and surfaces that have been contaminated with the virus. Clean your hands often and wear a mask if you have a fever or respiratory symptoms.

### Safe food and water precautions

Eating or drinking unsafe food or water, or swimming in contaminated water can make you sick while travelling. Take precautions by following these tips:

* Boil it, cook it, peel it, or leave it (only eat food that is prepared safely)
* Avoid, if possible, getting water in your eyes, mouth, or nose when swimming in freshwater (like streams, lakes, or canals), especially after heavy rain or flooding - the water might look clean but can still be contaminated
* Don’t swallow water when bathing, showering, swimming in pools, or using hot tubs

[Eat and drink safely abroad](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/food-water)

Travellers' diarrhea

[Travellers' diarrhea](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/diarrhea.html) is the most common illness affecting travellers. It is spread from eating or drinking contaminated food or water.

Risk of developing travellers' diarrhea increases when travelling in regions with poor standards of hygiene and sanitation. Practise safe food and water precautions.

The most important treatment for travellers' diarrhea is rehydration (drinking lots of fluids). Carry oral rehydration salts when travelling.

### Tick and insect bite prevention

Many diseases are spread by bites from infected ticks and insects like mosquitoes, fleas, or flies. Before you travel, find out what types of ticks or insects are in the area, when they’re most active, and what diseases they can spread.

To protect yourself from bites:

* use an approved bug spray (insect repellent) on exposed skin
* wear light-coloured, loose clothing made of tightly woven materials like nylon or polyester
* wear socks and closed-toe shoes
* sleep under mosquito netting if you’re outdoors or staying in places that aren’t fully enclosed
* do a full body tick check on yourself, your children, your gear, and any pets you’re travelling with when you return from outdoor activities

Chikungunya

There is a risk of chikungunya in this country. The level of risk may vary by:

* season
* year
* region
* elevation

The virus that causes chikungunya is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. It can cause fever and pain in the joints. In some cases, the joint pain can be severe and last for months or years.

Protect yourself from mosquito bites at all times.

[Insect bite and pest prevention](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/insect-bite-prevention.html)

A vaccine for the prevention of chikungunya (IXCHIQ) is approved in Canada. Talk to your healthcare provider about how best to prevent chikungunya, including the benefits and risks of vaccination based on factors such as your age, itinerary and personal preferences.

Zika virus 

[Zika virus](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/zika-virus.html) is a risk in this country.

Zika virus is primarily spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. It can also be sexually transmitted. Zika virus can cause serious birth defects.

During your trip:

* [Prevent mosquito bites](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/insect-bite-prevention.html) at all times.
* Use condoms correctly or avoid sexual contact, particularly if you are pregnant.

If you are pregnant or planning a pregnancy, you should discuss the potential risks of travelling to this destination with your health care provider. You may choose to avoid or postpone travel.

For more information, see [Zika virus: Pregnant or planning a pregnancy.](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/zika-virus/pregnant-planning-pregnancy.html)

### Animal precautions

Some infections, like rabies and bird flu (avian influenza), can be spread from animals to humans. Certain activities can increase your chances of coming into contact with animals, like:

* travelling in rural or forested areas
* camping, hiking, or visiting caves
* visiting places where live animals are sold or killed for food, like wet markets

To reduce your risk of getting sick, avoid contact with animals like stray dogs, livestock (such as pigs and cows), monkeys, snakes, rodents, birds, and bats. Avoid eating undercooked meat.

Make sure to closely watch children; they are more likely to try to touch animals.

### Person-to-person infections

When travelling, you can reduce your risk of getting or spreading respiratory infections, like the flu or COVID-19, by:

* staying at your accommodation and limiting contact with others if you’re sick
* wearing a well-fitting mask, especially:   
  + if you’re sick and need to be around others
  + when you’re at large indoor events or in crowded settings, like sporting events, concerts, and airports
* cleaning your hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or using hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol
* covering your coughs and sneezes with a tissue or your elbow, not your hands

Tuberculosis

[Tuberculosis](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/tuberculosis.html) is an infection caused by bacteria and usually affects the lungs.

For most travellers the risk of tuberculosis is low.

Travellers who may be at high risk while travelling in regions with risk of tuberculosis should discuss pre- and post-travel options with a health care professional.

High-risk travellers include those visiting or working in prisons, refugee camps, homeless shelters, or hospitals, or travellers visiting friends and relatives.

### Medical services and facilities

Healthcare is limited throughout the Solomon Islands. Up front payment may be required.

Medical evacuation can be very expensive and you may need it in case of serious illness or injury.

Make sure you get travel insurance that includes coverage for medical evacuation and hospital stays.

[Health and safety outside Canada](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety)

### Keep in Mind...

The decision to travel is the sole responsibility of the traveller. The traveller is also responsible for his or her own personal safety.

Be prepared. Do not expect medical services to be the same as in Canada. Pack a [travel health kit](http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/kit), especially if you will be travelling away from major city centres.
