# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs in the Northern Mariana Islands.

Residential break-ins and theft from vehicles, hotel rooms and rental units may also take place.

* Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Never leave valuables such as jewellery, cell phones, electronics, wallets or bags unattended on the beach or in your vehicle
* Avoid unpopulated areas and unpatrolled beaches after dark
* Check with local authorities to determine which beaches are safe

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations occur occasionally. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Water activities

Coastal waters can be dangerous, even for excellent swimmers. Coastal ocean currents are powerful and rip currents are common.

Rescue services may not be consistent with Canadian standards. Not all beaches have lifeguards or warning flags to warn of unsafe conditions.

* Don’t swim after hours or outside marked areas
* Consult residents and tour operators for information on possible hazards and safe swimming areas
* Only undertake scuba diving and other water activities with a well-established company
* Avoid participating in any water activities when you are under the influence of alcohol or other substances
* Monitor weather warnings
* Follow the instructions and warnings of local authorities
* Check that your travel insurance covers accidents related to recreational activities
