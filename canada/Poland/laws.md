## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Transfer to a Canadian prison

Canada and Poland are signatories to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in Poland to request a transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both Canadian and Poland authorities.

This process can take a long time, and there is no guarantee that the transfer will be approved by either or both sides.

Poland does not recognize dual citizenship and does not allow its citizens to serve sentences abroad. Dual nationals may, therefore, not receive the agreement of the Polish authorities to be transferred to a prison in Canada.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect lengthy jail sentences.

It is illegal to consume alcohol in public places. If you are found intoxicated in a public area, you may be detained and could be taken to a sobering-up centre, where you may need to spend the night. You will be responsible for paying the cost of the stay.

### Photography

Photography of military installations and some public buildings and monuments may result in a penalty. These installations generally have adequate signage. If in doubt, you should seek permission from local authorities before taking photographs.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Poland.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of Poland, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Poland.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Poland, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Polish court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Poland to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Identification

Local authorities may request to see your ID at any time.

* Carry valid identification or a photocopy of it at all times
* Keep a photocopy of your passport in a safe place in case it’s lost or seized
* Keep a digital copy of your ID and travel documents

### Driving

You must carry an international driving permit. It must be obtained prior to arrival in Poland.

The use of cellular telephones while driving is prohibited, unless they are fitted with a hands-free device.

The use of seatbelts is mandatory for the driver and any passenger in the car. Children below 150 cm may not ride in the front seat without a child car seat. Infants in a rear-facing child car seat may only sit in the front seat of the car if the airbag is deactivated.

Headlights must be on at all times.

Penalties for drinking and driving are severe. The legal blood alcohol limit is 0.02 percent. Convicted offenders face heavy fines and jail sentences.

Foreigners may be required to pay traffic violation fines on the spot.

### Cycling

Riding a bike under the influence of alcohol is illegal and subject to detention and fines.

In rural areas, cyclists and pedestrians must wear reflective clothing (or vest) when on the road between dusk and dawn or risk a fine. A cyclist or pedestrian involved in an accident and not wearing a reflective item could be held liable.

### Public transportation

Transporation tickets must be validated at the start of any trip. You could be fined on the spot if you fail to show a validated ticket to an official upon request.

Always ensure that:

* you have purchased and validated your ticket
* the ticket matches the area and mode of transportation in which you are travelling

### Money

The currency of Poland is the zloty (PLN).

If you are carrying €10,000 or more, or the equivalent in other currencies, you must make a declaration to customs when you enter or leave the European Union. It includes sums in:

* banknotes and coins
* bearer negotiable instruments such as cheques, travellers’ cheques, promissory notes and money orders
* bonds, shares
* gold coins with a gold content of at least 90 %
* gold bars, nuggets or clumps with a gold content of at least 99.5 %
* any other convertible asset

This does not apply if you are travelling within the European Union or in transit to a non-EU country.
