## Safety and security

### Impact of the armed conflict in Ukraine

In February 2022, Russia began a military invasion of Ukraine, which shares a land border with Poland.

Projectiles from the armed conflict in Ukraine have passed through Polish airspace and debris has landed in areas near the Ukrainian border.

If you are currently in Poland or are planning to visit in the future:

* always be aware of your surroundings, especially near the border with Ukraine
* follow the instructions of local authorities
* monitor trustworthy news sources to stay informed on the evolving situation

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs, mostly in larger cities.

Theft is frequent in:

* buses, trains, bus and train stations and airports
* major tourist destinations, including busy markets
* areas near hotels

On the train:

* exercise caution, particularly at night
* be extra cautious while you board and disembark
* store personal belongings in a safe place
* ensure the door to your compartment is locked from the inside

On the road:

* be especially vigilant when stopped at traffic lights, as thieves travelling on scooters or on foot can snatch bags from passenger seats
* keep your windows closed and car doors locked at all times
* keep your bags out of the reach of pedestrians

### Fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud occurs, particularly at bars and nightclubs.

When using debit or credit cards:

* pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others
* use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

Cybercrime occurs in Poland. Perpetrators may compromise public Wi-Fi networks to steal credit card or personal information.

* Avoid using unsecured public Wi-Fi networks
* Avoid making purchases on unencrypted websites
* Be cautious when posting information on social media
* Be particularly vigilant if you decide to meet someone you met online
* Never click a suspicious link in an email or text message asking for your credit card detail

### Spiked food and drinks

Snacks, beverages, gum and cigarettes may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

* Be wary of accepting these items from new acquaintances
* Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers

Exercise caution at bars, nightclubs and adult entertainment venues that lure clients with promises of discounts. Customers have been served spiked drinks and then overcharged on their credit cards while under the influence of intoxicants at such establishments.

* Carry a limited amount of cash
* Verify the price list before ordering and the bill before paying
* Report all crimes to the local police before leaving the country because you cannot complete a police report after leaving Poland

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations and marches occur frequently. They are usually held on days of social or historical significance, such as:

* National Independence Day on November 11
* International Worker’s Day on May 1
* the anniversary of the Smolensk air disaster on April 10

In Warsaw, protests often occur in front of Polish government buildings and foreign diplomatic missions.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations, marches, and large gatherings are taking place
* Expect a heightened security presence
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in Europe. Terrorist attacks have occurred in a number of European cities. There is a potential for other violent incidents.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

### Soccer matches

Confrontations, which at times become violent, may occur between opposing fans at soccer matches. Traffic and public transportation may also be affected. Fan clubs operate similarly to gangs and certain clubs have links to organized crime.

* Exercise caution if you attend a soccer match or if you stay near sporting venues
* Be aware of large groups of supporters during soccer matches

### Adventure tourism

The South of Poland contains two high mountain ranges, the Carpathians and Sudetes. Mountain activities, such as hiking, climbing, and skiing, can be dangerous if unprepared. Weather conditions can change rapidly and can be severe, even in the summer. Lightning strikes are particularly common in the Tatra region of the Carpathians, as well as a risk of sudden storms and avalanches.

If you intend to go hiking, mountaineering, or skiing:

* never do so alone and don’t part with your tour companions
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* ensure that you are properly equipped and well informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary, including when you expect to be back to camp
* know the symptoms of acute altitude sickness, which can be fatal
* obtain detailed information on trekking routes or ski slopes before setting out and do not venture off marked trails or slopes, particularly in early or late winter

### Road safety

Poland continues to improve its highway system, but travel by road can be hazardous outside of major centres. Slow-moving agricultural vehicles are common in rural areas. Drivers often pass slow-moving vehicles by crossing into oncoming traffic.

#### Road conditions

Rural roads are often narrow with no shoulders for pedestrians or cyclists.

Driving can also be dangerous due to:

* the lack of speed limit signs
* poorly maintained secondary roads
* traffic congestion

Avoid travelling after dark in remote areas.

#### Driving habits

Drivers may be aggressive and do not respect traffic laws, especially at pedestrian crossings. Road rage is common.

The country’s role as a major east-west route for transport trucks also poses risks. Vehicles entering Poland from outside the EU may have lower safety or emissions standards and drivers may not respect all traffic laws.

In Warsaw, authorities routinely block major roads for ceremonies, state visits, or national holidays.

### Public transportation

#### Taxis

There have been reports of sexual assault and harassment in unofficial taxis. Officially marked taxis will display the rate per kilometre on the back passenger window, visible from the outside. They are also required to have an operating meter.

* Only use officially marked taxis
* Make sure that the taxi has an operating meter or pre-arrange your fare
* Be wary of taxi drivers who approach you at the airport or whose vehicles do not display telephone numbers or a company name, these drivers usually charge exorbitant rates.
