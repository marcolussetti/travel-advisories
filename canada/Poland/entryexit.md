# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Polish authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Schengen area

Poland is a Schengen area country. Canadian citizens do not need a visa for travel to countries within the Schengen area. However, visa-free travel only applies to stays of up to 90 days in any 180-day period. Stays are cumulative and include visits to any Schengen area country.

If you plan to stay in the Schengen area for a longer period of time, you will need a visa. You must contact the high commission or embassy of the country or countries you are travelling to and obtain the appropriate visa(s) prior to travel.

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 3 months beyond the date you expect to leave the Schengen area.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Land border crossings and prohibited border areas

From July 7 to August 5, 2025, Polish authorities will conduct checks at the borders with Germany and Lithuania due to irregular migration patterns.

If you plan to cross into Poland from Germany or Lithuania:

* follow the instructions of local authorities
* have your travel documents ready

Polish authorities have shut down certain border crossings with Belarus and Russia (Kaliningrad) due to security concerns. If you intend to travel to Poland from Belarus or Russia, you must apply for a humanitarian reasons permit.

If you plan to cross from Poland into Belarus or Russia, only the following border crossings remain open to cars and buses:

* Belarus:
  + Brest/Terespol
* Russia:
  + Grzechotki/Mamonovo
  + Bezledy/Bagrationovsk

Access to border areas with Russia (Kaliningrad), Ukraine and Belarus is prohibited within a range of 15 m to 2 km, depending on the location. Follow these limitations at all times, except at designated border crossings. The prohibited areas are marked with signs in Polish.

For more information, contact the Polish Border Guard:

* Phone: +48 22 500 4068, +48 22 500 4568, or + 48 22 500 43 76

### Vehicles with Russian license plates

Since September 2023, Poland has enforced an entry ban on vehicles registered in Russia with nine or fewer seats. This restriction is currently in place at the border and reflects existing European Union sanctions against the Russian Federation.

Vehicles registered in Russia carrying Russian license plates will be refused entry into Poland regardless of the driver’s nationality.

### Dual citizenship

Canadians who also hold Polish citizenship must enter and exit Poland using their Polish passport.

### Other entry requirements

Customs officials may ask you to show them a return ticket or onward ticket and proof of sufficient funds for your stay.

### Mandatory registration

Foreigners must register their stay in Poland within 48 hours of arrival if the stay is to exceed 14 days. Registration will normally be arranged by your hotel. If you are not staying in a hotel, your host, landlord or holder of the property deed of the residence must register your stay. You should confirm with your host that they have registered you when you arrive at your accommodations.
