## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Transfer to a Canadian prison

Canada and France are signatories to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in France to request a transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both Canadian and France authorities.

This process can take a long time, and there is no guarantee that the transfer will be approved by either or both sides.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect jail sentences or heavy fines.

### Identity checks

You may be subject to identity checks during your stay in France.

Always carry valid identification such as a driver's licence, passport or a copy of it.

Keep photocopies or digital copies of the following documents, in case of loss or seizure:

* the identification page of your passport
* your birth certificate
* your Canadian citizenship card
* your driver’s licence

Keep originals and copies in separate safe locations.

#### Concealing your face in public places

In France, it’s illegal to cover your face in public places, including international airport arrivals areas.

Offenders risk a very high fine. There is no exemption for tourists or for religious reasons.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in France.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of France, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and France.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in France, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the French court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in France to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Driving

You must be at least 18 years old to drive a car in France.

You should carry an International Driving Permit. You can drive with your Canadian licence for up to 1 year. If you stay in France, you will have to exchange your Canadian licence for a French licence.

Numerous roadside cameras have been installed to help enforce traffic regulations. You could receive heavy fines if you do not obey the speed limit or the Highway Code. Local authorities may also confiscate your driver’s licence.

Fines must generally be paid within 3 days. They may be increased in case of delay of payment.

A reflective vest and warning triangle are mandatory in all vehicles.

From November 1 to March 31, winter tires or chains are compulsory in some cities and regions in mountainous areas.

#### Priority to the right

The “priority to the right” system is in effect in France. Drivers must give way to vehicles approaching from the right at intersections, even on secondary roads. This is often a surprise to foreign drivers and results in accidents.

In general, traffic in a roundabout has priority over vehicles trying to enter it. Priority switches to vehicles from the left.

#### Low-emission zones

Some cities and territories have put in place low emission zones to reduce air pollution.

Access to these zones is restricted to vehicles that meet certain environmental standards. You may need to get a permit to drive in these areas.

### Money

The currency of France is the euro (EUR).

If you are carrying €10,000 or more, or the equivalent in other currencies or monetary instruments, you must make a declaration to customs when you enter or leave the European Union.

This does not apply if you are travelling within the European Union or in transit to a non-EU country.
