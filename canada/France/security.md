# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in Europe. Terrorists have carried out attacks in several European cities.

Over the past few years in France, several opportunistic and premeditated attacks have occurred. These have resulted in many deaths and injuries. Further attacks are likely.

#### Vigipirate plan

The Vigipirate plan is a set of measures established by the French government to prepare and protect the French population, infrastructure and institutions in the event of an attack. The aim is also to allow rapid deployment of intervention measures if necessary.

As part of this plan, the government maintains a 3-level public alert system for terrorism. The Vigipirate plan’s security level is currently at level 3, « urgence attentat» (“attack emergency”). Changes in the threat level are communicated online and through local and national media.

#### Operation Sentinelle

Operation Sentinelle allows the deployment of military brigades in public places to patrol and deter terrorist acts. Expect an increased police or military presence in public places.

Enhanced security measures have been deployed in various strategic locations, including:

* transport hubs
* public places
* tourist locations, especially in Paris

Attacks can occur anywhere. Terrorists may target:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* cultural venues, including concert halls, nightclubs, and event centres
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places. Be particularly vigilant if attending sporting events and during religious holidays and other public celebrations, as terrorists have used such occasions to mount attacks.

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crimes, such as pickpocketing and purse and mobile phone snatching, are common. Thieves often target tourists.

Petty crime occurs frequently on public transportation, particularly:

* the Paris metro
* Île-de-France regional express network (RER) lines linking the capital to its surroundings
* international rail routes such as Paris-Brussels-Amsterdam and Paris-London.

Thieves are very skilled. They often act in groups and regularly work with minors. They may use various techniques to divert your attention and steal your belongings.

Thieves are mainly active in large cities and busy places, such as:

* popular tourist sites
* department stores
* restaurants and patios
* hotel lobbies
* parks
* transport hubs

During your trip:

* keep your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, in a secure place
* don't carry large sums of cash or valuables unnecessarily
* avoid walking alone after dark
* be aware of your surroundings, especially in busy tourist areas
* be extra cautious when withdrawing cash from ATMs
* Keep a photocopy of your passport in a safe place in case it's stolen

#### Violent crimes

Violent crimes are rarer, but still occur.

Tourists are sometimes victims of violent attacks by groups of young people who want to rob them. These attacks usually occur :

* around major tourist attractions
* near railway stations
* on trains of the Île-de-France regional express network (RER) connecting the capital to its surroundings

Assaults can also occur outside night-time establishments and in more isolated areas at night.

#### Residential break-ins

Residential break-ins occur, especially in large cities and coastal areas. Burglars sometimes target houses or holiday rental apartments.

While in France:

* be vigilant, particularly when approached by strangers
* ensure that your belongings, including passports and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* avoid showing signs of affluence and carrying large sums of cash
* limit the use of mobile phones on public transportation and in crowded areas to ensure you remain aware of your surroundings and to avoid attracting attention
* don't keep your credit, debit cards and cash in the same place
* never leave your bags unsupervised
* choose well-secured accommodation and make sure you lock doors and windows at night and when you're away

#### Parked vehicles and vehicles on the road

Vehicle break-ins are frequent. Theft of parked cars or their contents is particularly common on beach roads in the south of France and at highway rest stops throughout the country, especially during the summer, when there is a high number of travellers.

* Leave nothing in view in the vehicle
* Use secure parking facilities
* Be particularly vigilant when renting automobiles, as rented vehicles are a target of choice

Drivers are often tricked into stopping their cars by thieves who either obstruct the road or distract the driver by flashing their headlights. They may also pretend that you have a flat tire or even puncture a tire themselves. Once the vehicle is stopped, the thieves seize the opportunity to steal a bag or other valuable objects.

* Beware of any person who waves at you to stop on the highway
* Be especially vigilant when stopped at traffic lights, as bags are often snatched from the front passenger seat by thieves travelling on scooters
* Keep windows closed and doors locked at all times

#### Victims of crime

If you're a victim of theft, go to the nearest police station to report the crime. Keep a copy of your theft report, as you will need it if you wish to make a claim to your insurer. If the incident takes place in the metro, a metro officer can direct you to the nearest police station.

You can complete an online pre-complaint for certain types of minor crime, such as property theft, before going to the police station. This may speed up the process once you get there.

### Bomb threats

Since October 2023, there have been a number of bomb threats sent to public places across France.

Bomb threats and hoaxes can target any location, including:

* tourist areas
* shopping centres
* transportation hubs
* government facilities
* schools
* religious institutions

If you are in an area targeted by a bomb threat, follow the instructions of local authorities including evacuation orders.

### Fraud

#### Credit card and ATM fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud occurs.

When using debit or credit cards:

* pay careful attention if other people are handling your cards
* use ATMs located in public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transaction on your account statements

#### Cybercrime

Cybercrime and online extortion, including phishing scams, occur.

Cybercriminals can compromise public Wi-Fi networks to steal personal data or credit information. They may try to trick you with communications that seem legitimate but are fraudulent. These could include promises of discounted merchandise or accommodations, or free event tickets.

* Use secure public Wi-Fi networks
* Carry your own USB adaptor or carry an extra battery pack instead of using public charging stations
* Make online purchases only from secure and official websites
* Be cautious when posting information or photos on social media
* Beware of people who show a keen interest in you online
* Always meet new acquaintances in a secure and familiar location

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations occur frequently. They are usually planned as permission from the local authorities is required. However, unauthorized and spontaneous demonstrations also take place.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

Radical activists and vandals have a history of using aggressive and violent tactics during demonstrations in order to cause damage and provoke a strong response from the police. They sometimes throw stones, smoke grenades, bottles and other debris at rallies. The police normally respond with tear gas to disperse the crowds.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

[Mass gatherings (large-scale events)](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/mass-gatherings)

### Strikes

Strikes and pressure tactics occur regularly, particularly in key sectors such as transport. These strikes can sometimes complicate travel and disrupt public services.

* Consult local media to be aware of strikes that may affect your stay or travel plans
* In the event of a transport strike, plan extra time to get to your destination

### Swimming, boating and water safety

#### Swimming

Coastal waters can be dangerous. Always obey warning flags at beaches.

The main warning flags used in France are:

* Green: calm waters, swimming is allowed
* Yellow: agitated waters, swim with precautions
* Red: dangerous waters, swimming is prohibited
* Purple: contaminated waters or presence of dangerous aquatic species, swimming is prohibited

In autumn and winter, be cautious when walking on the shore, as waves can be unpredictable, breaking further than expected and causing strong undertows.

* Avoid visiting beaches or coastal areas during periods of severe weather warnings
* Look out for signs warning of cliff erosion and falling rocks
* Don't dive into unknown waters, as hidden rocks or shallow depths can cause serious injury or death
* Exercise caution and follow the advice of the local authorities

#### Recreational boating

If you are planning to go boating:

* know the capacity of your boat (people and weight) and don't exceed it
* know the navigation rules
* follow safe practices for all activities on the water: personal watercraft, water-skiing and towed devices, diving or swimming, fishing, etc.
* equip your boat with a VHF marine radio that will generate your position in case of emergency
* be prepared for emergencies

Search and rescue missions in France are carried out by the Regional Operational Surveillance and Rescue Centres (CROSS). In case of emergency, contact the centre on VHF radio channel 16 or by dialling 196.

### Mountain activities

Mountain activities, such as hiking, can be dangerous, especially if they are not well prepared. Trails are not always marked and weather conditions can change rapidly, even in summer.

In winter, heavy snowfall can make it difficult to reach some villages and ski centres. Roads may become impassable. There is also a risk of avalanches, some of which can be fatal.

If you intend to go hiking, mountaineering or skiing:

* never do so alone and do not part with your hiking companions
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* do not venture off marked trails or slopes
* ensure that you're adequately equipped
* stay informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary
* know the symptoms of acute altitude sickness, which can be fatal
* obtain detailed information on your activity and on the environment in which you will be doing it before setting out

### Road safety

French roads are well maintained.

Drive carefully and respect the Highway Code.

### Public transportation

Urban and intercity public transportation is reliable. When using these types of transport, make sure you validate your ticket and keep it until the end of your journey. The authorities carry out regular random checks and you may be fined if you do not have a validated ticket.

#### Taxis

There is a problem of illegal taxis in Paris airports and train stations. These scammers charge much higher rates than the official ones.

* Ignore direct solicitations when leaving the airport or train station
* Use only official taxis or a trusted ride-sharing app
* Don't share a taxi with strangers
