### Forest and maquis fires

Forest and maquis fires often occur in summer, particularly on the Mediterranean coast and in Corsica.

The air quality in areas near active fires may deteriorate due to heavy smoke.

There is a ban on smoking in woods and forests during high forest fire risk periods as defined by the prefecture. This ban applies equally to areas situated within 200m of wooded areas.

In case of a major fire:

* stay away from affected areas, particularly if you suffer from respiratory ailments
* follow the advice of local authorities
* monitor local media for up-to-date information on the situation
