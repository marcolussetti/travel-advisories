# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Crime

Violent crime is rare in Guadeloupe, despite growing concerns over gang-related violence. Petty crime remains the most significant threat for tourists.

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and bag-snatching, occurs, including by thieves on motorcycle. There is an increased risk of criminal activity at night, especially in the old town centre of Pointe-à-Pitre, which is a port of call for Caribbean cruises.

* Avoid deserted beaches and isolated areas after dark
* Don’t walk alone at night
* Don’t carry large amounts of cash or wear expensive jewellery
* Ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Never leave personal belongings, such as money, credit cards, cell phones and other electronics, unattended, especially on beaches

### Fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud occurs. Be cautious when using debit or credit cards:

* pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others
* use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

### Demonstrations and strikes

Demonstrations and labour strikes occur. They may cause disruptions to services. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety are very good throughout the island.

Roads are well-maintained but they may be narrow and winding. Night driving can be dangerous, especially in the mountains and on rural roads.

### Public transportation

#### Buses

Bus services are safe. Both urban and inter-city bus transportation is available.

#### Taxis

Taxis are safe but expensive. By law, they must be metered.

#### Ferries

Ferry services provide transportation to the islands that make up Guadeloupe as well as to Martinique and Dominica.
