## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are strict. Convicted offenders can expect jail sentences and heavy fines.

### Photography

Photography of security forces, diplomatic sites, government installations, airports and the Owen Falls Dam (at the source of the Nile River, near Jinja) is prohibited. Always ask for permission before photographing individuals.

### Camouflage clothing

Wearing military-style or camouflage clothing is prohibited and may result in a jail sentence.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

The laws of Uganda prohibit sexual acts between individuals of the same sex. In May 2023, the President of Uganda approved the 2023 Anti-Homosexuality Bill. If enforced, it would increase penalties for convicted offenders up to the death penalty for certain cases. It would also impose:

* up to 20 years’ imprisonment for recruitment, promotion and funding of same-sex activities
* 14 years’ imprisonment for those convicted of “attempted aggravated homosexuality”

Societal discrimination based on identity and sexual orientation is widespread. 2SLGBTQI+ persons are routinely harassed by the police. Incidences of blackmail and extortion directed against 2SLGBTQI+ persons and their families are common.

2SLGBTQI+ persons should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Uganda.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Uganda.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Uganda, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Uganda.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Uganda by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Uganda to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Driving

Traffic drives on the left.

An International Driving Permit is recommended.

Drivers must always carry:

* a valid driver’s license in English or with a certified translation
* vehicle registration documents
* proof of valid insurance
* a valid vehicle inspection certificate

These documents must be produced on demand by a police officer.

You must be at least 18 years old to drive a private motor vehicle in Uganda.

If you are over 18, you may drive using a Canadian driver’s licence for up to 90 days from the date of entry into Uganda.

In the event of an accident, Ugandan law requires drivers to stop and exchange information and assistance. There is a possibility of mob anger if the accident has caused serious injury. In such cases, remain in your vehicle and drive to the nearest police station to report the accident.

Penalties for driving under the influence of alcohol include immediate imprisonment.

#### Traffic violations

If you are stopped for a traffic violation, the police officer may ask you to pay an on-the spot fine. Police, however, are not permitted to accept cash on the spot without issuing an official receipt. If you disagree with the traffic ticket, you have the right to ask for due process. The officer should provide you with information on when and where you can go to be properly charged, and then you may pursue that process.

### Money

The currency is the Uganda shilling (UGX).

Credit cards are accepted only by major hotels, airlines and some car rental agencies. You will find a foreign exchange (forex) bureau at most border posts and in all major cities. Most shops, banks and forex bureaus do not accept or exchange U.S. dollars printed before 2007.
