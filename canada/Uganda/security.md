## Safety and security

### Bomb blast in Munyonyo

On June 3, 2025, an attempted terrorist attack occurred outside the Martyrs’ Shrine in Munyonyo, Kampala.

If you’re in Uganda:

* stay away from the affected area
* avoid crowded places and public gatherings
* always be aware of your surroundings
* monitor local media for the lastest information

### Border with the Democratic Republic of Congo

The volatile security situation in the eastern part of neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) could lead to possible incursions into western Uganda by armed rebel groups from the DRC.

At the end of November 2021, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo started a joint military operation against the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) in North Kivu and Ituri provinces of the DRC, near Virunga National Park.

Ugandan military troops are present on both sides of the border. There is also a risk of banditry in this area.

### Border with South Sudan

The border with South Sudan is porous and banditry and criminality are a concern. Inter-communal tensions and clashes are common in this area. Given the security situation in South Sudan, we recommend that you avoid travelling to areas within 50 km from the border.

### Karamoja Province

Clashes between tribal groups occur, especially in districts north of Kate Kyoga. There is also a risk of banditry.

### Western Uganda

Western Uganda has a history of inter-ethnic violence.

Due to political tensions between Uganda and Rwanda, the land border may be closed without notice. Be sure to check that it’s open before trying to cross.

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in Uganda. On October 17, 2023, an attack occurred near the Queen Elizabeth National Park in south-west Uganda and resulted in three casualties. On October 15, 2023, the Ugandan police foiled a bomb attack on churches in the central Butambala district, west of Kampala. The Ugandan police also located and disabled improvised explosive devices (IED) in three locations in Kampala and on its outskirts in September 2023.

Terrorists have previously carried out attacks, including in June 2023 on a school in Mpondwe, near the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo, resulting in several casualties.

Further attacks cannot be ruled out. While the attacks do not appear to have targeted foreigners, exercise increased caution in and around Kampala.

Targets could include:

* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners
* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places. Expect a heightened presence of security forces in Kampala. They may conduct increased security checks in public areas.

### National Parks

There are several national parks in Uganda, including near the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo. Local authorities have enhanced security measures in these areas; however, tourists have been involved in security incidents in the past.

If you are visiting a national park:

* only use reputable and professional guides or tour operators
* don’t take any tours that will bring you into the Democratic Republic of Congo
* closely follow park regulations and rangers’ advice
* stay informed of recent developments in the security situation in the area before travelling as it can change quickly

### Crime

Armed banditry, car thefts, muggings and kidnappings occur throughout Uganda and foreigners have been targeted.

Petty crime, including pickpocketing, purse and jewellery snatching and theft from hotel rooms and vehicles, occurs regularly.

If attacked, don’t resist, as offering resistance may result in violence.

* Maintain a high level of personal security awareness at all times and in all places
* Take appropriate security measures, particularly on roads linking a city centre to residential areas
* Refrain from travelling at night
* Never leave your bags unsupervised at a ticket office or a registration desk
* Ensure that your personal belongings, including passports and other travel documents, are secure at all times, and that your credit and debit cards, cash and any other financial resources are not all kept in the same place
* Don’t show signs of affluence
* Don’t carry large sums of money
* Travel in groups if possible

#### Armed robberies

Armed robberies are perpetrated against pedestrians, even during day time.

Armed robberies also occur along roadways, particularly at night.

Keep your vehicle doors locked at all times, windows closed and personal belongings, including handbags, safely stored.

* Don’t leave items such as laptops and briefcases in unattended vehicles
* Don’t display jewellery or electronics when walking
* Remain vigilant when using public transportation or walking along deserted streets
* Avoid walking and driving at night

Taxi and matatu (minibus) operators have robbed their passengers and stranded them far from their destination. Avoid taking taxis or matatus that have only one or two passengers, and ensure that your personal belongings are secure at all times when using public transportation.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations may occur. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

2SLGBTQI+ persons have been attacked and harassed based on their identity and sexual orientation. Violent incidents have increased since the Parliament passed an “anti-homosexuality” bill in March 2023.

2SLGBTQI+ travellers should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Uganda.

### Women’s safety

Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse.

### Spiked food and drinks

Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

### Identification

Carry a photocopy of your passport’s identification page and the page containing your visa, and keep the original in a secure place.

Tourist facilities and infrastructure are adequate in Kampala, Jinja and larger national parks, but limited elsewhere in the country.

### Wildlife viewing

Wildlife viewing poses risks, particularly on foot or at close range.

* Only visit game parks and reserves with a reputable tour company
* Always maintain a safe distance when observing wildlife
* Only exit a vehicle when a professional guide or warden says it’s safe to do so
* Only use reputable and professional guides or tour operators
* Closely follow park regulations and wardens’ advice

### Road safety

A lack of traffic signs, reckless driving habits, wandering animals, pedestrians and poor road conditions pose risks. Pedestrians should exercise caution when crossing roads. There are many fatal road accidents in Uganda. The Jinja–Kampala and Maska–Kampala roads are of particular concern. Alcohol is often a contributing factor to accidents, particularly at night. Highway travel is dangerous, especially after dark, because of banditry and poor visibility. Avoid driving outside major cities after dark.

If travelling to Uganda by road, you should get information from the appropriate border police station regarding the security situation at your next destination.

### Public transportation

#### Buses

Avoid intercity buses (especially overnight long-distance buses) and vans. Fatal accidents caused by reckless driving, excessive speed and poor vehicle maintenance have occurred in the past.

#### Taxis

Exercise caution when using other forms of public transportation, such as matatus and boda-bodas (moped taxis), and ensure that the vehicle is in good condition before departure. If you opt to travel by boda-boda, wear a helmet at all times.

#### Ferries

Ferry accidents are not uncommon, due to overloading and poor maintenance of some vessels. Do not board vessels that appear overloaded or unseaworthy.

### Air travel

We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.
