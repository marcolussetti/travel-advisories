#### Violent crime

Violent crime is not frequent, but does occur. There have been violent crimes committed in the cities of Colón and David, as well as in some beach communities.

Express kidnappings have also occurred. Criminals abduct victims, usually for a few hours, and force them to withdraw money from ATMs in exchange for their release.

### Curfews for minors

Curfews for minors (under 18 years old) may be in place in Panama.  
Police may arrest minors who are outside alone late at night if they’re perceived to be involved in suspicious activities. They may be detained until the police can contact their parents, who may receive a fine.

If you are travelling with a minor to Panama while a curfew is in effect:

* stay informed of areas where curfews may be in place
* ensure that they carry proper identification
* monitor local media for the latest information
* follow the instructions of local authorities, including curfew orders

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations occasionally occur. They can lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. Police may use tear gas and other methods to disperse crowds.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local and social media for information on ongoing demonstrations
* Check your route before travelling and be prepared to modify your plans in case of disturbances and roadblocks

### Water activities

#### Swimming

Lifeguards don’t usually supervise beaches. Tidal changes can cause powerful currents, and riptides are common. Several drownings occur each year.

Rescue services may not be consistent with international standards.

* Consult residents and tour operators for information on possible hazards and safe swimming areas
* Follow the instructions and warnings of local authorities

#### Diving

Tour operators may not adhere to international standards.

If you undertake adventure sports, such as diving:

* choose a well-established and reputable company that has insurance
* ensure that your travel insurance covers the recreational activities you choose

If in doubt concerning the safety of the facilities or equipment, don’t use them.

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety are poor throughout the country.

Drivers often drive dangerously.

Night construction on the Pan-American Highway is frequent, and the highway is not well-lit.

* Keep car windows closed and doors locked at all times
* Be prepared for possible roadblocks

### Public transportation

Public transportation has improved in the recent years but may be unreliable.

#### Buses

Local buses within Panama City don’t always follow a regular route. Due to the risk of theft, when travelling by bus:

* be aware of your surroundings
* protect your belongings

#### Taxis and ridesharing

Registered yellow taxis are generally safe if located at a taxi stand, which are usually found at malls, hotels and main transport hubs.

They are not metered. Fares are calculated according to the number of zones crossed to get to a destination. It's preferable to have small bills available to pay taxi fares.

When using a taxi:.

* agree to a fare before departure
* tell the driver you don’t want to share a taxi, since they may attempt to pick up additional passengers
* always sit in the back of the vehicle

Rideshare apps are commonly used throughout the country.

If you use a trusted ridesharing app, confirm the driver’s identity and the licence plate before getting in the car.

### Boating

The following areas are known as transportation corridors for narcotics:

* the southeastern coast of Comarca Kuna Yala
* Coiba Island
* the Mosquito Gulf
* the entire length of the Pacific coast

These areas are especially dangerous at night. Boaters should be wary of vessels that may be involved in smuggling.
