## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

Panama’s legal system is complex. Reporting a crime differs greatly from reporting a crime in Canada and may vary among Panama’s provinces. Local authorities generally do not speak English or French. Therefore, you may require a translator or legal representation.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect heavy fines and long jail sentences.

### Identification

Panamanian law requires all individuals to carry official identification documents at all times. Authorities may jail and fine you if you fail to produce identification upon request.

### Photography

Indigenous persons may ask you for a small fee if you take picture of them.

Ask permission before taking photographs of individuals, particularly of children and women.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Panamanian law does not prohibit sexual acts between individuals of the same sex.

However, 2SLGBTQI+ persons could be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression or sex characteristics.

### Driving

You can drive in Panama with your Canadian driver’s licence for a period of up to 90 days.

Although vehicle insurance is mandatory, many Panamanians drive without it. In the event of an accident:

* call the police
* don’t move the vehicle until a police officer tells you to do so

You should carry an international driving permit.

### Investments

If you plan on buying property or making other investments in Panama, seek legal advice in Canada and in Panama. Do so before making commitments. Related disputes could take time and be costly to resolve.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Panama.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Panama, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Panama.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Panama, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Panamanian court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Panama to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

It is used interchangeably with the U.S. dollar (USD).

There have been issues with counterfeit US$50 and US$100 bills. Carry only small bills of U.S. dollars.
