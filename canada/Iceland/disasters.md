## Natural disasters and climate

### Reykjanes Peninsula

On July 16, 2025, a new volcanic eruption began on the Reykjanes Peninsula in Southwest Iceland, near the town of Grindavík and the Blue Lagoon. Further eruptions could happen at any time and without warning.

The Icelandic authorities have closed roads near the eruption site and declared a state of emergency in the area around:

* Grindavík
* the Blue Lagoon
* Svartsengi powerplant

Keflavik International Airport has not been affected by the eruptions. Flights to and from the airport continue to run on schedule.

Iceland is subject to various natural disasters such as:

* violent storms
* glacial floods
* volcanic eruptions
* earthquakes and landslides

The climate can be unpredictable regardless of the time of year. Monitor weather reports closely.

### Climate change

Climate change is affecting Iceland. Extreme and unusual weather events are becoming more frequent and may affect your travel plans. Monitor local media for the latest information.

### Storms

Storms occur regularly in Iceland and are most common during fall and winter months, usually from October to March. These storms bring strong winds, heavy rain or snow, creating hazardous conditions. Travel and driving conditions can be dangerous.

* Monitor local media for the latest updates, including those on road conditions
* Monitor weather reports

### Glacial floods

Glaciers cover about 10% of Iceland, making it prone to "jökulhlaup", glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). GLOFs are frequent, unpredictable, and can last from a few hours to a few weeks.

Flooding can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable, and bridges may be damaged.

* Monitor local news and weather reports
* Follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders

### Seismic activity

#### Volcanoes

There are several active volcanoes in Iceland. The Reykjanes Peninsula in Southwest Iceland, near the town of Grindavík and the Blue Lagoon, has experienced recurring volcanic eruptions since July 2023. Further eruptions could occur at any time and without warning. Following an eruption, winds can blow clouds of poisonous volcanic gas far from the eruption site. This could bring potentially dangerous pollution levels to areas unaffected by the eruption, including Reykjavik.

Volcanic ash fall may:

* damage vehicles
* disrupt domestic and international flights
* cause road and bridge closure
* deteriorate air quality and affect your breathing, especially if you suffer from respiratory ailments.

Dangerous lava flows can also move slowly over land. The Icelandic authorities limit access near active eruption sites by closing roads and issuing evacuation orders.

If you are in an area affected by volcanic eruptions:

* do not approach an active eruption or walk on recently cooled lava
* avoid areas close to mountains and steep slopes due to danger of falling rocks and landslides
* monitor the local air quality, particularly if you suffer from respiratory ailments
* keep your windows closed and turn off ventilation systems
* avoid low-lying ground and valleys

There are several geysers around the country. Boiling water and steam from geysers can result in severe burns.

During your stay in Iceland:

* always obey safety rules and advice in the vicinity of volcanoes and geysers
* follow the instructions of local authorities, including any evacuation orders
* monitor local media sources for up-to-date information on volcanic activity

#### Earthquakes and landslides

Iceland is located in an active seismic zone. Earthquakes commonly occur, especially around volcanoes before and during eruptions.

Landslides can occur with little warning following volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. Roads may become impassable.

* Monitor local media for the latest updates, including those on road conditions
* Stay away from flooded areas
* Monitor weather reports
