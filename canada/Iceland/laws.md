## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Transfer to a Canadian prison

Canada and Iceland are signatories to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in Iceland to request a transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both Canadian and Iceland authorities.

This process can take a long time, and there is no guarantee that the transfer will be approved by either or both sides.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect jail sentences or heavy fines.

### Identification

Local authorities may ask for your identification at any time. Keep a photocopy of your passport in case of loss or seizure. Keep your original passport in a safe, dry place.

### Drones

The recreational and commercial flying of drones is strictly regulated.

You must have permission from the Environment Agency of Iceland to use a drone in several protected areas. If you don’t comply, you may be fined and have your drone confiscated.

### Camping

It’s illegal to camp outside organized campsites or urban areas unless the landowner has explicitly granted permission.

By law, human waste must be properly disposed of when camping in Iceland. This includes travellers using camper vans or cars to visit remote areas. All human waste must be stored and disposed of at designated sites.

### Natural artefacts

It’s illegal to remove and export fossils and certain types of rocks from their natural setting without a permit issued by the Icelandic Institute of Natural History.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Iceland.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Iceland, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Icelandic court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Iceland to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.
