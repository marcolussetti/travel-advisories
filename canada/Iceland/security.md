# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs.

Ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times.

#### Violent crime

Although rare, violent crime has occurred in downtown Reykjavik, particularly inside and near nightlife venues including bars and clubs. Incidents include:

* gang violence
* knife attacks

Tourists are usually not targeted. However, you could be at the wrong place at the wrong time.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations may occur. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in Europe. Terrorists have carried out attacks in several European cities. Terrorist attacks could occur at any time.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places. Be particularly vigilant if attending sporting events and during religious holidays and other public celebrations, as terrorists have used such occasions to mount attacks.

### Swimming and water hazards

Coastal waters can be dangerous. Riptides, large waves, and strong ocean currents can catch even experienced swimmers off guard. Large surges of water or “sneaker waves” have killed people at the Reynisfjara and Kikjufjara black sand beaches in southern Iceland, including one in June 2022.

Inland waters may also be dangerous. Many of Iceland’s rivers have swift currents and waterfalls. Hot springs can be dangerously hot.

* Always check downstream before you swim in a river
* Always check the water before going into a natural hot spring

### Adventure tourism and natural hazards

The weather conditions, rough terrain, and volcanic activity in Iceland can lead to safety concerns if you don’t adequately prepare for your trip.

Trails and natural hazards are not always well-marked or signed. Certain routes cross glaciers that are dangerous to navigate without proper equipment and training. Volcanic and geologically active areas pose a distinct risk to hikers and trekkers. Hazards can be hidden within the landscape.

If you plan on trekking, biking, visiting natural tourist attractions or travelling to remote areas:

* never go alone and stay with companions
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* make sure that you’re well-equipped and informed about weather and any hazardous conditions
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary
* register your itinerary and contact details with the Icelandic authorities and book accommodations, or camp, in authorized campsites
* carry a cell phone, emergency contact information, and bring an emergency position indicating radio beacon (EPIRB) to remote areas

The Icelandic authorities maintain a web portal to inform tourists of good practices and hazards. You can register your itinerary and receive safety alerts through SMS. Icelandic emergency services also offer a location-based emergency assistance app called 112 Iceland App.

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety can vary throughout the country. Most urban roads, as well as Iceland’s national Route 1, the “ring road,” are paved. Many inland roads are unpaved, narrow and lack shoulders.

Most bridges outside of Reykjavik are one-lane. Slow down when approaching bridges to ensure there is no traffic approaching from the other side. If cars are approaching from both sides, the closest car to the bridge has the right of way.

Roads in the highlands and other remote areas are only open during the summer.

Driving can be hazardous, particularly in winter. Wildlife road accidents can occur. Be particularly vigilant if driving at nighttime.

If you plan to drive in a remote area, including the highlands:

* check road conditions
* use a four-wheel-drive vehicle
* share your travel itinerary with a third party
* bring a cell phone and sufficient supplies of fuel , water and food
