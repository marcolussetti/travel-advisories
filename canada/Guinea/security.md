# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Political situation

A coup d’état took place in Guinea on September 5, 2021. Although the situation in Conakry is currently calm, it is evolving and could deteriorate quickly.

If you're in Guinea:

* exercise caution
* monitor local media to stay informed on the evolving situation

### Demonstrations

Since May 2022, the Guinean authorities consistenly ban demonstrations. On several occasions, riot police have used tear gas and warning shots to disperse crowds of protesters.

Demonstrations occur occasionally. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation. Telecommunication and Internet access may be disrupted. Authorities may impose curfews and restrict movement without notice.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Border areas

Instability in neighbouring countries and armed banditry in West Africa pose a risk in Guinea. Exercise a high degree of caution near the borders with Côte d’Ivoire, Liberia, Mali and Sierra Leone, where ongoing cross-border military and rebel activities make these areas unsafe.

### Guinée Forestière

There is a risk of inter-ethnic violence in and around the town of NZérékoré, in Guinée Forestière.

### Industrial cities

There have been confrontations in industrial cities, such as Fria, where access to raw materials and tensions caused by work stoppages can aggravate the security situation.

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse-snatching occurs, particularly in the Madina, Niger and Taouyah markets. These crimes are often perpetrated by children.

* Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Don’t show signs of affluence
* Remain alert to your surroundings, especially at night

#### Violent crime

Violent crime is prevalent, especially in Conakry and in some rural areas, such as Kankan. Armed robbery, carjackings, assaults, muggings and break-ins occur in Conakry and the Kindia Region. These violent crimes are often perpetrated by men wearing military or police uniforms.

The risk of robberies and armed attacks increases after dark.

Foreigners are often the target of crime, especially at airports.

* Be vigilant while driving in Conakry and surrounding areas
* Exercise caution at airports and hotels, where offers of unsolicited assistance may come from persons seeking an opportunity to steal luggage, purses or wallets
* Be vigilant when travelling to and from Conakry International Airport, due to the prevalence of violent and opportunistic crimes against foreigners
* Arrange to arrive at the airport during the day and be met there by reliable contacts
* Drive with doors locked and windows rolled up at all time

### Strikes

In the event of a strike, shops could close for long periods of time with little warning. Ensure that you maintain stores of food, water and emergency supplies, sufficient to last three to four days.

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism. Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

### Shortages

Fuel and water shortages occur regularly in Conakry. These shortages affect transportation as well as the power supply, and have led to civil unrest causing death and injuries.

### Road safety

Local driving habits, the lack of road and traffic signs, poorly maintained vehicles and roads, pedestrians and livestock pose hazards to drivers. In the event of an accident, you should proceed to the nearest police station or medical facility, as roadside assistance and ambulance services are not available.

Overland travel outside major centres should only be undertaken during daylight hours and with a four-wheel-drive vehicle with spare tires. The vehicle should also be equipped with water, means of communication, a reflective hazard triangle, a fire extinguisher and a first aid kit. Drive in convoy. Road travel outside the capital may be difficult during the rainy season.

#### Roadblocks

Improvised roadblocks are often erected by armed groups or military troops, including on the Conakry airport road. Payment or proof of identity may be required at these roadblocks. Carry the following documents at all times:

* copies of identity papers (passport and visa)
* vaccination record
* vehicle registration (grey card)
* valid driver’s licence
* proof of road insurance
* vehicle safety check certificate

### Public transportation

Guinea has no official public transportation system. Although informal means of communal transport exist, such as taxis and buses, they should be used with extreme caution. Airline companies offer regular links from Conakry to the cities of Kankan, Labé, N’Zérékoré and Siguiri.

### Fraud

Cases of attempted fraud are frequently reported in this country.

### Power outages

Power outages are frequent throughout the country and may affect security conditions, especially in large urban centres.

### Tourist facilities

Tourist facilities are limited outside the capital.

### Piracy

Pirate attacks and armed robbery against ships occur in coastal waters. Mariners should take appropriate precautions.
