# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Colombian authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you use for travel.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond the date you expect to leave Colombia.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Entry fee

As of November 14, 2023, you must pay an entry fee equivalent to $85 CAD in Colombian Pesos upon arrival in Colombia. The payment must be made by credit card only upon entering the country during the immigration control process. There could be significant delays in making the payment, which could disrupt your travel plans.

You don't have to pay this entry fee if:

* your destination is the archipelago of San Andres, Providencia and Santa Catalina
* you have a valid Colombian visa
* you are less than 14 years of age or more than 79 years old
* you are a member of the crew of international transport means (conditions apply)

Failure to pay the entry fee could prohibit you from entering the country.

### Entry stamp

You must obtain an entry stamp in your passport when you enter Colombia by land.

You may be fined if you fail to obtain an entry stamp

### Length of stay for tourists

The immigration officer will determine the permitted length of your stay when you enter Colombia. As a tourist, you may be granted a stay up to 90 days.

You will be fined if you overstay the specified period on your entry stamp. You may apply for a stay extension at the nearest Colombian migration office. You may extend your stay up to a maximum of 180 days per calendar year. The final decision remains with the immigration authority.

### Other entry requirements

Customs officials may ask you to show them a return or onward ticket and proof of sufficient funds to cover your stay.

#### Archipelago of San Andrés, Providencia and Santa Catalina

If you plan to visit the Archipelago of San Andrés, Providencia and Santa Catalina, you must purchase a tourist card at the airport prior to  your arrival.

You must also show this card before you depart the island.

### Drug screening

Colombia employs strict screening measures at its international airports to detect narcotics smuggling.

Customs officials may:

* search you and your luggage
* fingerprint you
* require you to undergo an X-ray inspection upon arrival or departure

Most airport customs inspectors speak only Spanish.

### Ecuador entry restrictions

If you enter Ecuador from Colombia through land or river borders, you must present a criminal record check from your country of origin or residence. The original criminal record check and the Spanish translation must be apostilled and cover the past five years. Minors travelling with their family members are generally exempt.

If you cannot provide a criminal record check, the Ecuadorian Migration System will check to verify that you don’t have previous convictions.

### Dual citizenship

Canadian citizens who also hold Colombian citizenship must enter and exit Colombia using the following documents:

* Colombian passport
* Colombian identification card

Although local immigration authorities will allow dual citizens to enter without Colombian documents, they will stamp their foreign passport indicating that they must leave using Colombian documents.

### Children and travel

#### Exit requirements for dual citizen children

Whether travelling to a domestic or international destination, underage Canadian-Colombian dual citizens must present:
