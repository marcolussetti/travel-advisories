## Safety and security

### Land border crossings with Ecuador

Most land border crossings with Ecuador are closed until further notice. Only the Rumichaca International Bridge, near Ipiales-Tulcán, remains open.

### Dating applications

### Online dating applications

There has been an increase in deaths related to online dating applications used by criminals to identify and lure foreigners looking to meet people in Colombia.

Incidents occur most frequently in larger cities, including but not limited to:

* Bogota
* Cartagena
* Medellin

Online dating applications are often used by criminals to identify and lure foreigners travelling alone and looking to meet local people. Victims often build virtual relationships and attend multiple dates with the same person, often in public places. Once trust is established, the victim is drugged with scopolamine or another incapacitating drug and is robbed and/or kidnapped. Drugging of victims has led to overdose and death.

If you are in Colombia:

* be cautious if using online dating apps
* avoid meetings in isolated locations
* don’t bring new acquaintances to your accommodations
* inform a family member or friend of your plans, including details of with whom and where your date is

### Crime

Crime rates are high throughout the country, particularly in the main cities. In some cases, extreme violence leading to death has occurred.

#### Violent crime

Muggings and assaults occur even in the safer areas of Colombia’s cities. These incidents can turn violent. Firearms and other weapons are common in Colombia. Armed robberies are frequent and may occur in:

* streets
* buses
* taxis
* restaurants
* shopping malls

Criminals won’t hesitate to use weapons on victims who refuse to co-operate.

* Avoid walking alone in isolated or deserted areas
* Avoid travelling alone after dark
* Dress down and avoid wearing jewellery or watches
* Keep cell phones, cameras and other electronic equipment out of sight
* Avoid carrying large amounts of cash
* Use ATMs inside banks, shopping malls and other public locations during business hours only
* If you're robbed, hand over cash, electronic devices and valuables without resistance

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse and cell phone snatching, is common in all parts of the country. Drive-by snatching by thieves on motorcycles occurs regularly. They occur in both impoverished and wealthier parts of the country.

* Ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Stay in reputable accommodations with good security
* Keep windows and doors locked at all times

### Scopolamine and other incapacitating drugs

Scopolamine is a drug that temporarily incapacitates victims leaving them disoriented and unable to make clear decisions for 24 hours or more. Once the victim is incapacitated, they are vulnerable to crime, including:

* robbery
* assault
* express-kidnapping
* extortion

Overdoses have also been reported.

Criminals often target those travelling alone and may put drugs into a variety of items, including:

* food and drinks
* hand sanitizer
* women’s make-up

Incidents are most likely to occur:

* in nightclubs
* in bars and restaurants
* on public transportation, including taxis
* on the street

Criminals often work in teams, with women easing the victim into a false sense of security. Incidents occur most frequently in larger cities, including but not limited to:

* Bogota
* Cartagena
* Medellin

If you are in Colombia:

* never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers
* be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum, cigarettes or anything else from new acquaintances or someone in the street

### Vulnerable neighbourhoods

Vulnerable neighbourhoods (commonly known as “comunas”), are characterized by informal housing developments, crowded quarters, poorer conditions, and/or irregular construction.

Gang-related violence and organized crime are prevalent in these areas and police assistance is very limited.

Avoid renting accommodations in vulnerable neighbourhoods, and travelling to these areas, even on a guided tour.

### Kidnapping

There is a risk of kidnapping for ransom in Colombia.

Armed groups may target foreigners in all parts of the country, especially those who work for oil and mining companies. Business travellers and Canadian companies establishing operations in Colombia should take enhanced security measures to protect both personnel and company assets.

Choose living accommodations that have significant security measures in place and modern office facilities.

#### Express kidnappings

Express kidnappings are frequent and often occur in affluent areas, as well as in tourist areas. Criminals kidnap the victim from the street or a taxi and force the person to withdraw funds from an ATM. The victim is sometimes held overnight so that a second withdrawal can be made the next day.

* Avoid hailing taxis on the street
* If you're threatened by armed criminals, stay calm and don’t resist

### Terrorism

There is a threat of domestic terrorism. Terrorist groups are active in some parts of the country, often using explosives during periodic attacks.

Recent attacks include:

* on August 21, 2025, an attack occurred in Cali in front of the Marco Fidel Suarez Air Base, and caused multiple injuries and fatalities
* on July 4, 2025, attacks occurred in several regions, including Catatumbo, south Bolívar, Choco, Arauca, northeast Boyaca, Cauca, Nariño and Antioquia, targeting military and police installations, as well as critical infrastructure
* on June 10, 2025, several attacks occurred using explosives and firearms in the departments of Cauca and Valle del Cauca, including Cali, resulting in several casualties

Further attacks are likely. Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* military and police stations and vehicles
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* infrastructure, including roads and energy facilities
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places. Be particularly vigilant during:

* civic holidays
* public celebrations
* major political events, such as elections

Terrorists may use such occasions to mount attacks.

### Illegal armed groups

Illegal armed groups pose a major risk to travellers. These groups carry out violent attacks, such as bombings, and finance themselves through extortions and kidnappings. Attacks often result in casualties.

* Remain on well-travelled roads and paths when visiting remote locations
* Be aware of your surroundings at all times

### Fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud occurs frequently. Card overcharging also happens, especially in popular tourist areas, where scammers target tourists by charging them elevated prices for services, food and drink. Ask for a printed price list before ordering.

When using debit or credit card:

* don’t accept assistance from strangers
* pay careful attention when others are handling your cards
* use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

#### Fraudulent police officers

Individuals posing as police officers have approached foreigners to verify their documents or foreign currency with the intent to rob them.

If you face this situation:

* don’t hand over your money or documents unless you feel threatened
* request to provide your documents or currency at the nearest police station, your hotel or another public place

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations and strikes take place regularly throughout Colombia, especially in large cities.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Ayahuasca ceremonies

Spiritual cleansing and ayahuasca ceremonies, offered by shamans and other individuals, have led to serious illness, injury, assault and even the deaths of several tourists.

Ceremonies involve consuming substances that can cause medical complications and severely impair cognitive and physical abilities. They often take place in remote areas with no access to medical or mental health facilities or resources. Often, there is no access to communications with local authorities or emergency services. Facilities generally lack basic first aid or emergency plans to help those suffering from physical or psychological illness during these ceremonies.

Ayahuasca ceremonies are not regulated and individuals offering them are not licensed. There is no way to assess the safety of any of the services, the operators or the shamans.

Avoid participating in spiritual cleansing or ayahuasca ceremonies.

### Women’s safety

Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment or verbal abuse.

Incidents of attacks and sexual assault, including rape, have been reported throughout the country, particularly in tourist areas.

* Always remain vigilant
* Avoid walking alone at night
* Keep your hotel doors and windows locked
* Do not accept offers of transportation from strangers

If you are a victim of a sexual assault or other crime, you may report it immediately to the nearest Canadian office.

### Water safety

#### Swimming

Some beaches are unsupervised.  Many beaches do not have warning flags to alert of unsafe conditions. Lifeguard services do not always meet Canadian standards.  Tidal changes can cause powerful currents, and riptides are common.

* Respect the areas reserved for swimming
* Monitor weather conditions
* Avoid beaches and coastal areas if the weather forecast is poor
* Do not dive in unfamiliar waters as hidden rocks or shallow water can cause serious injury or death
* Consult residents and tour operators for information on possible hazards and safe swimming areas
* Follow the instructions of local authorities

#### Recreational boating

Due to unlicensed tour boats not meeting safety standards, boating accidents have occurred, including in:

* Cartagena
* San Andrés
* Santa Marta

If you are planning to go boating:

* choose a reputable boating company
* ensure that your tour operator follows up-to-date safety regulations
* don’t board vessels that appear overloaded or unseaworthy

### Adventure travel

Outdoor activities can be dangerous if unprepared, such as:

* white water rafting
* scuba diving
* snorkelling
* hiking
* mountain biking

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety can vary greatly throughout the country, due to:

* road signs that are difficult to see or non-existent
* lack of lighting and guard rails
* livestock on the roadside in rural areas
* pedestrians walking on the street

#### Road conditions

Driving conditions may be particularly hazardous during the rainy seasons, from April to May and from October to November.

#### Road habits

Drivers are extremely aggressive and reckless. They often speed and are frequently distracted and ignore traffic controls.

Motorcycles are common and are often involved in traffic accidents.

Pedestrians don’t have the right of way, including at stop signs.

When travelling by car in Colombia:

* avoid driving at night
* avoid driving on secondary roads as they are often targeted by criminals
* don’t pick up hitchhikers
* keep your doors locked and windows closed at all times
* always place all belongings under your seat
* carry a cell phone
* park your car in a guarded parking lot when in a city

#### Roadblocks

Local authorities may deny you entry to certain areas due to emerging security threats. Military checkpoints outside cities are common.

Strikes occur often in Colombia and associated roadblocks on major transit routes may cause significant travel disruptions.

Unauthorized roadblocks and bandits also pose a threat.

If you’re planning to travel by land in Colombia:

* dial 767 from your cell phone to receive advice on current road closures from the Colombian Highway Police information line (in Spanish)
* never hitchhike
* consult local media
* follow the instructions of local authorities

### Public transportation

You should avoid public transportation.

#### Buses and coaches

City and rural buses are frequent targets for theft. Incidents of passengers being drugged and robbed have occurred.

* Don’t accept snacks, beverages, gum, or cigarettes from new acquaintances
* Avoid storing bags in the overhead compartment or under your seat

#### Taxis

Express kidnappings and assaults often occur in unlicensed taxis.

* Avoid hailing taxis on the street
* Only use reputable taxi companies through establishments such as hotels or a ride-sharing app

If you have no choice but to hail a taxi on the street:

* avoid taxis without licence plates
* never enter a taxi if it already has a passenger
* note the licence plate number and name of the driver when you travel and immediately communicate this information to family or friends

El Dorado International Airport in Bogota allows only authorized taxis to pick up passengers at its terminals.

Arrange pickup in advance with your travel agency or hotel.
