## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

Penalties for breaking the law in Colombia can be more severe than in Canada, even for similar offences. No transfer of offenders’ treaty exists between Canada and Colombia. If you’re convicted of a serious crime, you must serve your jail sentence in Colombia. You may also have to remain in Colombia for a parole period following your release.

Detention conditions may be below the standards of Canadian prisons.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Colombia.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Colombia, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Colombian court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Colombia to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Identification

Local authorities may ask you to show identification at any time.

* Carry photo identification at all times
* Keep a photocopy of your passport and visa or residence permit in a safe place, in case they’re lost or confiscated

### Driving

You must carry a valid Canadian driver’s license. Your driver’s license will be accepted within your permitted length of stay.

In the event of a car accident:

* remain at the scene
* if there are injuries, don’t move your vehicle until the authorities arrive
* if there are no injuries, move your vehicle to the side of the road to avoid fines

Failure to remain at the site may be considered an admission of guilt under Colombian law.

However, some accidents may attract a crowd that could turn hostile. If you feel unsafe:

* ensure your windows and doors are locked
* leave the area
* report the accident to the police and your insurance company as soon as possible

### Marriage
