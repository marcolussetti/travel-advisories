* earthquakes
* extreme heat
* floods
* hurricanes

* torrential rains

### Climate change

Climate change is affecting Colombia. Extreme and unusual weather events are becoming more frequent and may affect your travel plans. Monitor local news to stay informed on the current situation.

### El Niño

The complex weather phenomenon called El Niño happens at irregular intervals of 2 to 7 years and can last 9 months to 2 years.

### Seismic activity

#### Volcanoes

There are several active and potentially active volcanoes throughout Colombia.

Debris from erupting volcanoes may clog rivers and cause them to overflow, which could in turn cause flash floods and landslides. Ash clouds may also cause disruptions to domestic and international flights.

#### Earthquakes

Colombia is located in an active seismic area. Earthquakes occur frequently. Dangerous landslides can also occur, even after minor earthquakes.

### Rainy seasons

Colombia’s rainy seasons usually occur from March to June and from September to November. Incidents of flooding and mudslides can occur, especially in rural areas.

Seasonal flooding can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable and bridges damaged.

### Hurricane season

The hurricane season is from mid-May to the end of November in the Pacific, and from early June to the end of November in the Atlantic, Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. During this period, even small tropical storms can quickly develop into major hurricanes.

These severe storms can put you at risk and hamper the provision of essential services. You could face serious safety risks during a hurricane. You should carefully consider these risks when planning a trip during the hurricane season.

If you decide to travel to a coastal area during the hurricane season despite the risks:

* be prepared to change your travel plans on short notice, including cutting short or cancelling your trip
* stay informed of the latest regional weather forecasts
* carry emergency contact information for your airline or tour operator
* follow the advice and instructions of local authorities
