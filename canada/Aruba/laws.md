## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Transfer to a Canadian prison

Canada and the Netherlands are signatories to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in Aruba to request a transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both Canadian and Aruban authorities.

This process can take a long time, and there is no guarantee that the transfer will be approved by either or both sides.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect heavy fines and jail time.

The island is used as a drug trafficking hub between South America and North America. Only carry your personal belongings and don’t leave them unattended. Don’t agree to carry packages that are not your own.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in the Netherlands, with some exceptions.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of the Netherlands, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Aruba.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Aruba by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Aruba to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.
