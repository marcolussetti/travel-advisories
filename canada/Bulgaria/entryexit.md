# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Bulgarian authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you use for travel.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid 3 months beyond the date you expect to leave Bulgaria.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Health Insurance

You must present proof of medical insurance (minimum €30,000 coverage) that’s valid in the European Union (EU) and covers the costs of emergency medical care and evacuation.

### Visas

Tourist visa: not required for stays of fewer than 90 days in any 180-day period  
Business visa: not required for stays of fewer than 90 days in any 180-day period  
Student visa: not required for stays of fewer than 90 days in any 180-day period

You must obtain a visa before travelling if you plan to stay in Bulgaria for more than 90 days. Bulgaria doesn’t grant extensions once you’re in the country, except in cases of emergency or marriage to a Bulgarian citizen.

### Schengen area

Bulgaria is a Schengen area country. Canadian citizens do not need a visa for travel to countries within the Schengen area. However, visa-free travel only applies to stays of up to 90 days in any 180-day period. Stays are cumulative and include visits to any Schengen area country.

If you plan to stay in the Schengen area for a longer period of time, you will need a visa. You must contact the high commission or embassy of the country or countries you are travelling to and obtain the appropriate visa(s) prior to travel.

### Other entry requirements

Upon entry, you may have to show proof of sufficient funds to cover your stay, as well as documents verifying your return or onward travel plans.

### Children and travel

Bulgarian authorities may consider a child born to a Bulgarian parent to be a Bulgarian citizen, even if the child was born in Canada and has a Canadian passport.

Accordingly, children under 18 may only leave Bulgaria when accompanied by both parents or with the consent of both parents. The absentee parent(s) must provide a statement of parental consent to travel, notarized by Bulgarian authorities. You or your child must present this consent form to the authorities upon exiting Bulgaria.

Furthermore, if you’re a single parent or the parent of a child travelling alone, you should contact the Embassy of the Republic of Bulgaria in Canada before travelling, to ensure that your child meets current entry and exit requirements. These may change without notice.
