## Safety and security

### Crime

#### Petty crime

* Pay particular attention at train and bus stations, tourist sites and crowded areas
* Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Avoid showing signs of affluence and carrying large sums of cash

#### Overcharging

Some tourists have been victims of overcharging in bars and clubs. Discussions about overcharging may lead to threats of violence by security guards, who may force you to pay.

* Be particularly vigilant at tourist resorts along the Black Sea, where this practice is most common

#### Vehicle theft

Vehicle thefts and break-ins occur frequently.

* Park in a guarded location whenever possible
* Store your valuables safely out of sight

Always be suspicious if someone offers to help you with a flat tire. These individuals may have punctured the tire themselves. They may seize the opportunity to steal your purse or other valuable objects while you’re distracted.

#### Organized crime

Organized criminal groups are active in casinos and nightclubs. Violent crime may occur, and includes bombings and shootouts between rival gangs.

#### Fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud occurs. ATMs fitted with fraudulent card readers are common, particularly in Sofia, Burgas and Varna. Be cautious when using debit or credit cards:

* pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others
* use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

#### Spiked food and drinks

Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in Europe. Terrorist attacks have occurred in a number of European cities. There is a potential for other violent incidents.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

Keep in mind, however, that even the most secure locations aren’t completely free of risk.

In response to terrorist attacks in other European cities, Bulgarian authorities have strengthened their security measures in all cities, particularly where large crowds gather.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations may occur. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety can vary greatly throughout the country. Driving conditions may be hazardous due to aggressive drivers, excessive speeds, poor lighting and a lack of traffic signs and lane markings. Potholes and wandering animals are common on rural roads.

* Avoid confronting aggressive drivers, as they may be armed
* Avoid driving after dark outside of major cities
* Be especially cautious when driving during winter, as roads may not be plowed or salted

#### Pedestrians

Be cautious when crossing streets. Drivers don’t always give pedestrians the right of way.

#### Bribery

Police occasionally solicit bribes. They may delay you if you refuse to pay the bribe, but you’re unlikely to experience additional problems beyond inconvenience.

### Public transportation

#### Taxis

* Use only licensed taxis with meters
* Verify the tariffs on the taxi’s window before entering, as taxi drivers sometime overcharge
* At Sofia Airport, visit the taxi booth in the arrivals terminal to obtain a fair rate

#### Rail services

Rail services are generally poor. It’s preferable to travel via inter-city buses.

#### Public transportation systems

Most cities and larger towns have public transportation systems. Inter-city buses are frequent, comfortable and relatively fast. Regular bus service exists between most of Bulgaria’s major cities and towns.

Disruptions and delays to public transportation services, including at ferry ports, railway stations and border crossings, may occur.
