## Natural disasters and climate

### Earthquakes

Bulgaria is located in an active seismic zone.

### Flooding

Bulgaria is prone to flooding after heavy rains. Flooding is often localized, but widespread flooding has occurred in the past. Consult Bulgaria’s National Institute of Meteorology and Hydrology for information and flooding alerts.

### Avalanches

In winter, there’s a risk of avalanches in mountainous regions. This risk increases when temperatures rise rapidly after a particularly harsh winter. Extreme weather can also cause landslides.

### Wildfires

In the summer and early fall, there’s a risk of wildfires.
