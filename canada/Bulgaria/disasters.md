### Flooding and landslides

Since October 3, 2025, heavy rains have caused severe flooding and landslides in the southeast of the country, particularly along the Black Sea coast. The floods and landslides have caused casualties and significant damage to buildings and infrastructure. A state of emergency was declared in several coastal areas, including the cities of Nesebar and Tsarevo.

More rainfall is expected in the coming days, increasing the risk of additional flooding in areas already affected.

If you are in an affected area:

* stay away from flooded areas
* monitor local news and weather reports
* follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders

### Earthquakes

Bulgaria is located in an active seismic zone.

### Flooding

Bulgaria is prone to flooding after heavy rains. Flooding is often localized, but widespread flooding has occurred in the past. Consult Bulgaria’s National Institute of Meteorology and Hydrology for information and flooding alerts.

### Avalanches

In winter, there’s a risk of avalanches in mountainous regions. This risk increases when temperatures rise rapidly after a particularly harsh winter. Extreme weather can also cause landslides.

### Wildfires

In the summer and early fall, there’s a risk of wildfires.
