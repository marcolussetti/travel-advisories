# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Romanian authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Schengen area

Romania is in the Schengen area. Canadian citizens do not need a visa for travel to countries within the Schengen area. However, visa-free travel only applies to stays of up to 90 days in any 180-day period. Stays are cumulative and include visits to any Schengen area country.

If you plan to stay in the Schengen area for a longer period of time, you will need a visa. You must contact the high commission or embassy of the country or countries you are travelling to and obtain the appropriate visa(s) prior to travel.

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 3 months beyond the date you expect to leave the Schengen area.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Visas

Tourist visa: not required for stays up to 90 days within any 180-day period Business visa: not required for stays up to 90 days within any 180-day period  
Student visa: required

The 90-day, visa-free period begins upon initial entry into Romania.

If you plan to return to Romania within 180 days of your last visit, authorities will only allow you entry for what’s left of your 90-day, visa-free exemption. If you’ve already spent 90 days within any 180 day-period, authorities may refuse you entry.

### Children and travel

Romanian authorities consider a child born to a Romanian parent as a citizen of Romania, even if the child was born in Canada and has a Canadian passport.

When leaving Romania, a Romanian citizen under the age of 18 must:

* travel with one of the following

+ both parents
+ one parent with the written consent of the non-accompanying parent
+ their legal guardian(s)
+ an authorized person over the age of 18 who has passed a criminal record check.

* carry a standard statement of consent to travel from their parent(s) or guardian(s), notarized by Romanian authorities. This does not apply to Romanian children returning to their proven country of legal residence.

Entry and exit requirements for children under the age of 18 may change without notice. Parents of children travelling alone or with one parent should contact the nearest Romanian embassy or consulate before departing for Romania to confirm that each child meets the latest entry and exit requirements.
