## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Transfer to a Canadian prison

Canada and Romania are signatories to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in Romania to request a transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both Canadian and Romania authorities.

This process can take a long time, and there is no guarantee that the transfer will be approved by either or both sides.

### Identification

You must carry photo identification at all times as local authorities can ask you to prove your identity. A photocopy of your passport is acceptable, and will help in case of loss or seizure of the original document.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect prison sentences of up to 15 years and heavy fines.

### Photography

It is illegal to photograph government buildings and military installations, unless prior permission has been obtained from local authorities.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Romania.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Romania, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Romania.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Romania, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Romanian court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Romania to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Driving

You must carry an international driving permit along with a valid Canadian driver’s licence in order to drive or to rent a vehicle in Romania. However, your Canadian driver’s licence is only considered valid for up to 90 days. For stays longer than 90 days, you will need to exchange your driver’s licence for a Romanian one.

Traffic laws are strict and local authorities carry out frequent road checks.

There is zero tolerance for driving under the influence of alcohol and penalties are severe. If a police officer suspects you of drinking and driving, they could confiscate your driver's licence on the spot. If you’re convicted, you can expect heavy fines and jail sentences. It is illegal to refuse a breathalyser test.

You must carry vehicle registration and proof of insurance.

A motorway vignette (locally known as a rovinieta) is required to travel outside major cities. You may purchase these at border points, post offices and large gas stations.

Headlights must be on at all times when driving, regardless of the time of day or weather.

Winter tires are mandatory during winter months.

You must carry a fire extinguisher, a first aid kit and a warning triangle in your car.

The use of a cellular telephone while driving is prohibited, unless it is fitted with a hands-free device.

Children under 12 cannot sit in the front seat of a vehicle.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Although Romanian law does not prohibit sexual acts between individuals of the same sex, homosexuality is not widely accepted.

### Money

The currency of Romania is the leu (RON).

Exchanging money on the street is illegal. You may exchange Euros in recognized establishments, such as exchange shops, banks and hotels. Carry crisp bills, as merchants may not accept well-worn or used banknotes. Traveller’s cheques are not widely accepted. The economy is primarily cash-based, but credit cards are widely accepted in major urban centres.

If you are carrying €10,000 or more, or the equivalent in other currencies or monetary instruments, you must make a declaration to customs when you enter or leave the European Union.

This does not apply if you are travelling within the European Union or in transit to a non-EU country.
