### Flooding and landslides

Heavy rainfall has caused severe flooding and landslides across Sri Lanka, especially in the Uva and Central provinces. The President has declared a nationwide state of emergency.

Torrential rain has caused flash floods, significant infrastructure damage and casualties. Local authorities warn of more landslides and mudslides due to ongoing erosion.

Power has been restored to most of the country but there are still some outages. Potable water is limited in the affected areas of Uva and Central provinces. Telecommunications are also severely affected in these provinces. There have been long queues at gas stations and banks in the capital, Colombo, as well as localized shortages of fresh fruit and vegetables.

Roadways may be blocked by landslides or flood water. This can affect access to emergency services. All trains and many international flights have been cancelled. Some flights have been rerouted. Contact your airline if your travel plans have been affected.

Special measures are in place if you are unable to leave the country due to flood disruptions, including exemptions from overstay fees and visa extensions. If you have been unable to leave, you should extend your visa through the Department of Immigration and Emigration’s online portal.

If you are in Sri Lanka:

* stay away from affected areas
* move to higher ground, away from rivers and low-lying areas
* monitor local news and weather reports
* confirm your flight before going to the airport
* follow the instructions of local authorities

### Monsoon and rainstorms

The rainy season (or monsoon) extends from December to February in the northeast and May to September in the southwest. Between the northeast and southwest monsoons are two inter-monsoon seasons from March to April and from October to November. Scattered but intense rainfall and thunderstorms are common during inter-monsoons.

Severe rainstorms can cause flooding and landslides, which can lead to deaths, injuries and large population displacements.

### Earthquakes and tsunamis

Sri Lanka is located in an active seismic zone. Earthquakes and tsunamis may occur.

A tsunami can occur within minutes of a nearby earthquake. However, the risk of a tsunami can remain for several hours following the first tremor. If you’re staying on the coast, familiarize yourself with the region’s evacuation plans in the event of a tsunami warning.
