### Earthquakes and tsunamis

Sri Lanka is located in an active seismic zone. Earthquakes and tsunamis may occur.

A tsunami can occur within minutes of a nearby earthquake. However, the risk of a tsunami can remain for several hours following the first tremor. If you’re staying on the coast, familiarize yourself with the region’s evacuation plans in the event of a tsunami warning.
