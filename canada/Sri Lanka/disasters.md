## Natural disasters and climate

### Flooding and landslides

Heavy rainfall has caused severe flooding and landslides across Sri Lanka, especially in Badulla, Nuwara Eliya, Kandy and Matale districts.

Rain storms have resulted in flash floods, significant damage to infrastructure and casualties.

Roadways may be blocked by landslides or flood water. Local authorities have stopped train operations in mountainous regions due to landslide debris and flooded tracks.

If you are in an affected area:

* move to higher ground, away from rivers and low-lying areas
* monitor local news and weather reports
* confirm your flight before going to the airport
* follow the instructions of local authorities

### Climate change

Climate change is affecting Sri Lanka. Extreme and unusual weather events are becoming more frequent and may affect your travel plans. Monitor local media for the latest information.

### Monsoon and rainstorms

The rainy season (or monsoon) extends from December to February in the northeast and May to September in the southwest. Between the northeast and southwest monsoons are two inter-monsoon seasons from March to April and from October to November. Scattered but intense rainfall and thunderstorms are common during inter-monsoons.

Severe rainstorms can cause flooding and landslides, which can lead to deaths, injuries and large population displacements.

* Monitor local media for the latest information, including on road conditions
* Stay away from flooded areas
* Monitor weather reports
* Follow instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders

### Earthquakes and tsunamis

Sri Lanka is located in an active seismic zone. Earthquakes and tsunamis may occur.

A tsunami can occur within minutes of a nearby earthquake. However, the risk of a tsunami can remain for several hours following the first tremor. If you’re staying on the coast, familiarize yourself with the region’s evacuation plans in the event of a tsunami warning.
