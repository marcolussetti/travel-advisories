# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Sri Lankan authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond the date you expect to leave Sri Lanka.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

Canadians must apply online for an Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA), the short-term visa required to visit Sri Lanka.

An ETA allows for a short visit of up to 30 days. Carry a copy of your ETA approval when you go through immigration upon arrival.

Visas may be extended at Sri Lanka's Department of Immigration and Emigration in Colombo.

You cannot convert a visa status once in Sri Lanka. Non-compliance with visa restrictions may result in deportation.

You will also need to fill out an online arrival card. You can complete the online form three days before arriving in Sri Lanka.
