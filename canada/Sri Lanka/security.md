# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations occur frequently in Colombo, and occasionally elsewhere in the country. Security forces may use tear gas and water cannons during violent protests.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Security forces

The Sri Lankan military continues to maintain a strong presence in the country’s north and east, including the Jaffna Peninsula. Military and police checkpoints could be established and roads could be closed suddenly.

Security forces have wide-ranging powers, including the authority to:

* impose curfews
* detain individuals without charge for extended periods
* search individuals, vehicles, residences and businesses

Individuals of Sri Lankan heritage, including those who don’t have Sri Lankan citizenship, have been detained on occasion by police or security forces.

* Always carry valid photo identification with you
* Keep an eye out for signage warning of military or demining zones
* Keep to well-travelled roads
* Avoid venturing in forested areas or abandoned properties
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* If you’re detained, ask the authorities to contact the High Commission of Canada

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism. People have been killed in past attacks.

Further attacks can’t be ruled out. Targets could include:

* government buildings
* schools, including universities
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

### Landmines

Despite mine clearance efforts, marked and unmarked minefields may still be present in parts of the Jaffna Peninsula and eastern Sri Lanka.

If you are travelling in the affected areas:

* be especially vigilant in remote areas

* avoid walking in fields
* avoid roadside ditches, shoulders and unmarked trails
* pay attention to signs indicating the possible presence of landmines

To avoid falling victim to an online scam:

### Inter-communal tensions

Inter-communal and religious tensions exist throughout the country and have led to violence. Further violent incidents could occur.

### Shortages and the economic situation

Although Sri Lanka's economic situation has stabilized, there are occasional shortages of certain medicines and food items.

### Spiked food, drinks and other items

Foreigners have been targeted in incidents of drink spiking, followed by sexual assault or theft. Never leave your food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as these items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

### Women’s safety

Women are often the target for unwanted attention and frequently subject to harassment in public. They should exercise caution when travelling alone.

Reports of sexual assault against foreign travellers are increasing. If you’re the victim of a sexual assault, you should report it immediately to the nearest Government of Canada office.

### Swimming

Tidal changes and strong winds can cause dangerous riptides.

Public beaches are generally unsupervised.

* Respect the areas reserved for swimming
* Always maintain a safe distance from boats and restricted areas
* Always respect warning flags advising of dangerous conditions
* Avoid beaches and coastal areas if the weather forecast is poor
* Do not dive in unfamiliar waters, as hidden rocks or shallow waters can cause serious injury or death

Crocodiles are present in some parts of Sri Lanka. Ask locals about safe swimming areas and avoid swimming in rivers.

### Wildlife observation

Wild animals can be dangerous, particularly if you are on foot or at close range.

* Always maintain a safe distance when observing wildlife
* Only exit a vehicle when a professional guide or warden says it’s safe to do so

* Closely follow park regulations and wardens’ advice

Drivers can be aggressive and reckless. Road accidents, often causing death and injuries, are common.

Driving can also be dangerous due to:

If you plan to travel by car in Sri Lanka, consider hiring a driver.

* Avoid hailing taxis on the street
* Only use reputable taxi companies through establishments such as hotels or ride-sharing applications
* Never share a taxi with strangers
* Make sure the driver does not pick up other passengers on the way to your destination
* If there is no meter, confirm the fare in advance
