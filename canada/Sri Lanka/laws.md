### 2SLGBTQI+ travellers

Sri Lankan law criminalizes sexual acts and relationships between persons of the same sex. 2SLGBTQI+ persons could also be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or sex characteristics.

2SLGBTQI+ persons should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Sri Lanka.

### Driving

Traffic drives on the left.

If you plan to rent a car, you must bring your Canadian driver’s licence or an International Driving Permit issued outside Sri Lanka. You will then need to obtain a temporary driver’s licence or a recognition certificate from one of the following:

* the permit counter at Bandaranaike International Airport
* the Automobile Association of Ceylon in Colombo
* the Department of Motor Traffic (DMT) in Werahera

Canadian driver’s licences are accepted only at the DMT. They must be accompanied by a certified translation if not in English.

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Sri Lanka.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Sri Lanka, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Sri Lanka.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Sri Lanka, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Sri Lankan court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Sri Lanka to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.
