## Safety and security

### Demonstrations in Los Angeles and other major cities

Since June 6, 2025, demonstrations have been taking place in Los Angeles and other cities. Additional security forces have been deployed to affected areas. Curfew orders may be imposed on short notice.

If you are in an affected area:

* stay away from demonstrations
* follow the instructions of local authorities, including curfew orders
* monitor local media for the latest information

### Border with Mexico

Criminal incidents associated with drug trafficking are more frequent at the border with Mexico, in the following states:

* California
* Arizona
* New Mexico
* Texas

If crossing the U.S.– Mexico border by car:

* remain extremely vigilant
* only use officially recognized border crossings
* avoid travelling at night

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs, particularly in urban centres and tourist locations.

* Don’t leave bags or valuables unattended in parked cars, especially rental vehicles, even in trunks
* Ensure that your belongings, including passports and other travel documents, are secure at all times

#### Violent crime

Within large urban areas, violent crime more commonly occurs in poor neighbourhoods, particularly from dusk to dawn. It often involves intoxication.  Incidents of violent crime are mainly carried out by gangs or members of organized crime groups but may also be perpetrated by lone individuals. Although violent crime rarely affects tourists:

* be mindful of your surroundings at all time
* verify official neighbourhood crime statistics before planning an outing
* if threatened by robbers, stay calm and don’t resist

#### Gun violence

The rate of firearm possession in the U.S. is high. It’s legal in many states for U.S. citizens to openly carry firearms in public.

Incidences of mass shootings occur, resulting most often in casualties. Although tourists are rarely involved, there is a risk of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

Familiarize yourself on how to respond to an active shooter situation.

#### Home break-ins

Canadians living in holiday homes have been the victims of break-ins and burglary.

Make sure you lock windows and doors securely at night and when you are away.

#### Common criminal strategies

Be on alert for robbery ploys targeting visitors.

Some criminals on highways target travellers leaving airports or other tourist destinations. They signal tourists to stop due to an issue with their vehicle. They then wait for the driver to pull over or exit the car before grabbing exposed valuables. Criminals may also throw items at the windshield, obscuring the view of the road and forcing the driver to pull over.

If you’re the victim of such a ploy:

* avoid pulling over on the side of the road
* put on your hazard lights and slowly drive to a gas station, police station or other safe and populated area

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations may occur. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud occurs, including debit card cloning. Be cautious when using debit or credit cards:

* pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others
* use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism. Terrorist attacks could occur at any time.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, and hotels

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) maintains a public alert system on terrorism to communicate information about terrorist threats.
