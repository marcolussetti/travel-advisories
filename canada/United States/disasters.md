### Climate change

Climate change is affecting the United States. Extreme and unusual weather events are becoming more frequent and may affect your travel plans. Monitor local media for the latest information.

### Hurricane season

Hurricanes usually occur from:

* May to November in the eastern Pacific Ocean, including Hawaii and Guam
* June to November in the Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico

During this period, even small tropical storms can quickly develop into major hurricanes.

These severe storms can put you at risk and hamper the provision of essential services. You could face serious safety risks during a hurricane. You should carefully consider these risks when planning a trip during hurricane season.

If you decide to travel to a coastal area during the hurricane season despite the risks:

* be prepared to change your travel plans on short notice, including cutting short or cancelling your trip
* stay informed of the latest regional weather forecasts
* carry emergency contact information for your airline or tour operator
* follow the advice and instructions of local authorities

* stay away from the affected area, particularly if you suffer from respiratory ailments
* always follow the instructions of local emergency services personnel, including any evacuation order
* monitor local media for up-to-date information on the situation
