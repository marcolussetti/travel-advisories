## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

Laws vary greatly from state to state. Consult the website of the state you wish to visit prior to arrival.

### Proof of status

Authorities may request proof of legal status in the U.S. at any time. Be prepared to show evidence of your legal presence in the U.S.

### Penalties and transfer of offenders

A serious violation of the law may lead to a jail sentence or, in some states, a death sentence. Canadian citizenship confers no immunity, special protection or rights to preferential treatment.

If a jail sentence is imposed, it will be served in a U.S. prison, unless a request for a transfer to a Canadian prison is approved by the United States and Canada. Both countries have signed a treaty that permits a Canadian imprisoned in the United States to request a transfer to complete the sentence in a Canadian prison.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect lengthy jail sentences and heavy fines.

#### Cannabis

Although the possession of cannabis is legal in some U.S. states, it remains illegal under U.S. federal laws in any form and quantity, making it illegal to bring across the Canada-U.S. border.

Don’t attempt to cross the Canada-U.S. border with any amount of cannabis in any form, even if you are traveling to a U.S. state that has legalized possession of cannabis. If you do so, you can expect legal prosecution and fines, and possibly jail time.

#### Prescription medication

Personal medication may be subject to U.S. drug importation laws and regulations.

In general, personal importation of a 90-day supply of medication is allowed. U.S. Customs and Border Protection has absolute discretion to allow or not your Canadian-purchased medication into the United States.

When taking any prescription medication to the United States, it’s important to:

* take only the quantity that you would normally take for the number of days you will be in the United States, plus an additional week’s worth
* pack medicines in their original packaging with the dispensary label intact that shows your name and other pertinent information such as the drug’s name, dosage and DIN (drug identification number)
* keep a duplicate of your original prescription, listing both the generic and trade names of the drug
* have a physician’s note explaining your condition and the reason for you to be legitimately carrying syringes, if applicable

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Federal systems in the U.S. are changing to no longer accept markers of gender identity. Sex assigned at birth may now be requested by federal forms and processes, including:

* visa applications
* NEXUS applications
* passenger manifests
* passport applications
* Social Security applications

Laws also vary by state and municipality. Some states have enacted laws affecting 2SLGBTQI+ persons. Check relevant state and local laws.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in the United States.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of the United States, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and the United States.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in the United States, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the American court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in the United States to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Expedited removal

U.S. Customs and Border Protection can bar non-citizens from the United States for five years if, in their judgment, the individuals presented false documentation or misrepresented themselves. Lying to a customs official is a serious offence.

There is no formal appeal process under expedited removal. However, if you believe the law has been misapplied in your case, you can request a supervisory review by writing to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services district director responsible for the port of entry where the decision was made.

### Imports and exports

Contact the specific U.S. Customs and Border Protection office at the Canada/U.S. border crossing you are planning to use before starting your trip for the latest information on allowances and restrictions on bringing items into the United States. These change frequently.

Declare all items at your point of entry.

### Travel to Cuba from the United States

Existing U.S. sanctions restrict travel between the United States and Cuba. Tourists may not travel between the two countries. However, you may go to Cuba from the United States on other types of travel, if you meet certain requirements.

### Driving

You can drive in the United States if you have a valid Canadian driver’s license.

Traffic laws can vary from state to state.

#### Automobile insurance

Many states have mandatory automobile insurance requirements, and many require motorists to carry appropriate proof of insurance. Each state’s motor vehicles department can give you more specific information.

If you are in the United States and wish to drive to Mexico in your personal vehicle, you may need to purchase liability insurance and additional auto insurance.

#### Hitchhiking

Never cross the border with a hitchhiker or as a hitchhiker. Though you may not be carrying anything illegal, the hitchhiker or driver might be, and you could be implicated.

Be equally careful about who and what you carry in your vehicle. As the driver, you could be held responsible for the misdeeds and belongings of your passengers, even if you were unaware of the problem.

### Money

The currency in the United States is the U.S. dollar (USD).

Canadian currency and personal cheques from Canadian banks are not widely accepted. Most banking transactions require a U.S. bank account.

There’s no limit to the amount of money that you may legally take into or out of the United States. However, you must declare to U.S. Customs and Border Protection:

* if you carry more than US$10,000 (in cash, cheque, money order,      travellers’ cheque or any other convertible asset) into or out of the      United States
* if you will receive more than US$10,000 while in the United States

Failure to comply can result in civil and criminal penalties, including seizure of the currency or monetary instruments.
