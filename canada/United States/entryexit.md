# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders and the Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet entry or exit requirements for the United States.

Individual border agents often have significant discretion in making those determinations. U.S. authorities strictly enforce entry requirements. Expect scrutiny at ports of entry, including of electronic devices. Comply and be forthcoming in all interactions with border authorities. If you are denied entry, you could be detained while awaiting deportation.

We have obtained the information on this page from the U.S. authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

You must provide proof of your Canadian citizenship upon entry to the U.S. There are several documents that can satisfy this requirement.

#### Travel by air

Canadian citizens travelling by air to the United States must present one of the following documents:

* a passport, which must be valid for the duration of their stay
* a valid NEXUS card, used at self-serve kiosks at designated airports

This requirement applies to all Canadian citizens, including children, travelling by air to or even just transiting through the United States.

### Registration

Canadians and other foreign nationals visiting the United States for periods longer than 30 days must be registered with the United States Government. Failure to comply with the registration requirement could result in penalties, fines, and misdemeanor prosecution. You should consult the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website to determine if you need to register with USCIS and how to do so. You can verify if you have been automatically registered on entry to the U.S. by looking up your I-94 admission form on the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) website.

### Additional information at borders

Customs officials may ask you to provide your address while in the United States (including Puerto Rico). Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers may also ask for:

* evidence of residential, employment or educational ties to Canada
* proof that the trip is for a legitimate purpose and is of a reasonable length
* proof of sufficient funds to cover your stay

### Dual citizens

#### Dual Canadian-American citizenship

Although U.S. authorities don’t formally require dual nationals to carry both a U.S. and a Canadian passport, carrying both documents as proof of citizenship may facilitate your entry into the United States and your return to Canada.

#### Canadians with dual citizenship from a third country

As of June 9, 2025, the U.S. is limiting the entry of nationals from specific countries under the proclamation “Restricting the Entry of Foreign Nationals to Protect the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats”. Canadian citizens, including dual citizens, travelling on a Canadian passport are not affected by this proclamation.

### Visas

Canadian visitors can usually stay in the United States for 6 months without a visa. You must declare your intended duration of stay upon entry into the United States.

In most circumstances, Canadian citizens don’t require visitor, business, transit or other visas to enter the United States from Canada but there are some exceptions.

In February 2025, U.S. authorities made changes to some of the instructions on how to fill out visa applications. If you do need a visa, make sure you follow the current instructions carefully when filling out your application.

#### Canadian permanent residents

Canadian permanent residents may need a non-immigrant visa to enter the United States.

You must obtain this visa from the U.S. authorities before entering the country. You must also have a valid passport from your country of citizenship.

As of June 9, 2025, the U.S. proclamation “Restricting the Entry of Foreign Nationals to Protect the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats” is in effect. It may impact your ability to obtain a visa if your country of citizenship is designated in the proclamation.

#### Visa Waiver Program

If you are a citizen of a country that is part of the visa waiver program (VWP), you don’t need a visa to enter the U.S. for stays up to 90 days. Instead, you must obtain pre-travel authorization via the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) prior your departure.

You must also carry proof of Permanent Resident Status in Canada upon re-entry into Canada.

#### U.S. permanent residents

Canadians who are permanent residents of the United States must present a valid U.S. permanent resident card upon entry.

#### Working in the United States

Most Canadian business travellers may apply for admission at a U.S. port of entry without first obtaining a non-immigrant visa. However, travellers entering the United States in certain business-related categories are required to present specific documents to establish eligibility for admission.

If you plan to work in the United States, contact the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate for specific requirements.

#### Studying in the United States

Canadian citizens don’t need visas to study or participate in a student exchange program in the United States. However, they need to be registered with SEVIS, a U.S. student tracking system. Students must present their registration form to CBP officers each time they enter the United States.

* [Canadian students](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/study.html) – U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs

### Length of stay

If you wish to stay longer than 6 months, you must apply for an extension at the nearest U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) office once you are in the United States and before the expiry of your initial authorized stay. Immigration officers may ask you to demonstrate that you are a temporary visitor in the United States.

The U.S. government strictly enforces immigration regulations. Remaining in the United States beyond your authorized period of stay can result in serious consequences such as detention or deportation.

There is no set period that you must wait to re-enter the United States after the end of your authorized stay. However, if a CBP officer suspects you are spending more time in the United States than in Canada, it will be up to you to prove to the officer that you are a temporary visitor, not a U.S. resident.

### Biometrics

Most ports of entry to the United States use facial recognition technology to verify your identity. In addition, digital fingerprints are required for some travellers.

### Electronic devices

U.S. border agents are entitled to search your electronic devices, such as your phones, computers or tablets, when you are entering the United States. They don’t need to provide a reason when requesting a password to open your device.

If you refuse, they may seize your device. The border agent could also delay your travel or deny entry if you are not a U.S. citizen.

Before crossing the border, put your device in airplane mode to ensure remote files don’t get downloaded accidentally.

### Preclearance

The preclearance service provides clearance for entry into the United States for persons and their luggage at a Canadian preclearance airport before departure instead of on arrival in the United States.

When using U.S. preclearance facilities at a Canadian airport, you must meet U.S. entry requirements. You will be interviewed by a U.S. preclearance officer. They are authorized to inspect your luggage and can refuse you entry into the United States.

It’s an offence under Canada’s Preclearance Act to knowingly make a false or deceptive statement to a preclearance officer.  While you are in a preclearance area, you are subject to Canadian law, including:

* the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
* the Canadian Bill of Rights
* the Canadian Human Rights Act
* Canada’s Preclearance Act
* Canadian criminal law

You may withdraw your request to enter the United States and leave the preclearance area at any time unless a U.S. preclearance officer suspects on reasonable grounds that you have made a false or deceptive statement or obstructed an officer. The officer may then detain you for violations of Canadian law.

### Criminal Record

If you have a criminal record, no matter the severity or the date of the offence, you may be refused entry to the United States. You may also experience problems when travelling through U.S. airport facilities. A pardon for an offence issued by Canadian authorities is not recognized under U.S. law to enter the United States.

If you are ineligible to enter the United States, you may apply directly to U.S. Customs and Border Protection for a temporary waiver of inadmissibility via the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate. Canadian citizens may also apply at land borders.

U.S. ports of entry are computerized and connected to a centralized database. Information is readily available on criminal convictions in both Canada and the United States. Even though you may have entered the United States without hindrance in the past, you could run into difficulty if your record shows a criminal conviction or a previous denial of entry. Attempting to gain entry without a waiver could result in several weeks of detention and a permanent ban from entering the United States.

Some exceptions apply, including under Nexus Marine.

### Cruises

You must have a valid Canadian passport to take a cruise from the United States. Some of the countries you visit will not permit entry without a passport. A passport is also important to re-enter the United States at the end of the cruise.

Ship authorities might retain your passport during the cruise, in accordance with their own administrative regulations and to facilitate clearance with U.S. Immigration.

If your passport is kept:

* obtain a receipt
* ensure you recuperate your passport at the end of the cruise
* always keep a photocopy of your passport with you

### Pets

Pets must appear healthy when examined at a port of entry. If there is evidence of poor animal health, your pet may be subject to examination and/or testing at your expense or may be denied entry.

Pets may also need to meet additional requirements, such as having:

* an import permit
* an export certificate or health certificate
* proof of vaccination (for example, rabies vaccination)

Animals may be subject to quarantine requirements.
