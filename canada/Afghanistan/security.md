# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Security situation

Foreigners and individuals associated to Western countries are targets for kidnappings and violence by terrorist groups. They are also at increased risk of being arbitrarily detained by the de facto authorities, especially if they had affiliations with the ousted government and/or contravene Islamic laws in effect since 2021.

The Afghan de facto authorities also frequently suspect foreign nationals, including dual nationals with Afghan nationality, of espionage. This is especially the case for those working or traveling in Afghanistan, such as humanitarian workers and journalists. They will likely monitor your movements and activities while you are in the country.

If you are targeted by the de facto authorities, they may take away your passport and/or arbitrarily detain you until they complete their investigations, which can last for months or longer. If you're found guilty of espionage or working to undermine Afghanistan’s national security, the punishment may be execution.

Canadians have previously been detained and were not allowed to contact Canadian consular officials, their family members, or a lawyer. If you are detained in Afghanistan, you could face months or years in prison without clarity about the charges against you.

Terrorist actors remain active in Afghanistan. Attacks could occur at any time, including in Kabul and other major cities.

The security situation is volatile and additional violent attacks could occur at any time across the country. Criminals are also taking advantage of the unstable security situation to commit violent attacks.

Violence against women is widespread in public and private spheres. Perpetrators are largely accorded impunity, and survivors have little to no recourse.

Travelling throughout the country is dangerous, including in Kabul. There are checkpoints on all roads and throughout cities. Women are not allowed to travel by themselves and often face difficulties at checkpoints. Some borders are closed or may close without notice. Border crossing is risky due to the presence of criminal groups and smugglers.

If you are in Afghanistan:

* exercise caution and be aware of your surroundings
* use your judgment to decide the best time and the safest means of exit if you need to move to a safer location
* monitor international media to stay informed about the latest developments and decrees

Since August 2021, the de facto authorities have issued a series of decrees to regulate acceptable behaviours according to their strict interpretation of Islam.

Freedoms, including of expression, movement and assembly, have been significantly reduced. All forms of dissent and criticism of the de facto authorities, including by journalists and activists from civil society, may result in arbitrary arrest and unlawful detention.

People who protest the restrictions imposed by the de facto authorities risk arrest, detention, physical violence and abuse, as well as being charged with ’moral corruption’.  Security forces use violent methods to disperse protests, including water cannons, tear gas, and live bullets.

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism throughout Afghanistan, including in Kabul and other major cities.

Terrorist actors remain active in Afghanistan. The de facto authorities fail to ensure security adequately, especially in border areas, and to counter frequent terrorist attacks.

Terrorists frequently target the following individuals:

* foreigners, especially from Western countries
* security and defence personnel
* non-governmental organizations (NGOs) personnel
* journalists and media workers
* healthcare workers
* other civilians

Attacks are unpredictable, both targeted and indiscriminate. They often involve the following types of weapons and/or devices:

* suicide vests
* improvised explosive devices (IEDs)
* vehicle-borne IEDs
* rockets and mortars
* assault weapons

Targets could also include:

* Afghan government buildings
* schools
* western interests, including foreign diplomatic representations
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels, medical facilities and other sites frequented by foreigners

Be particularly vigilant during:

* sporting events
* religious holidays
* public celebrations
* major political events,

Terrorists may use such occasions to mount attacks.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

2SLGBTQI+persons are discriminated against based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or sex characteristics. They are at high risk of physical attacks, sexual assault and other types of abuse.

### Kidnapping

There is a very high risk of kidnapping of foreign nationals by terrorist actors. They have kidnapped and sometimes killed Westerners, including tourists, journalists, teachers, doctors and non-government organization workers. Journalists may be lured with offers of interviews when the real purpose is to kidnap them.

These groups will target anyone perceived to have money for kidnapping or extortion purposes. Kidnap-for-ransom groups may also sell their captives to terrorist groups, with victims potentially facing years in captivity.

### Crime

#### Violent crime

Violent crime occurs, including widespread sexual and gender-based violence and harassment, armed robbery and carjacking. Weapons are readily available throughout the country, which increases the likelihood of violent attacks.

Afghanistan is a transit country for weapons and drugs, where several criminal networks operate. There is also a significant local production and consumption of drugs, especially synthetic drugs. Weapon and illicit drug trafficking and use may lead to violent spillovers.

* Avoid showing signs of affluence or carrying large sums of money
* Ensure that your personal belongings, passports and other travel documents are secure at all times

### Demonstrations

Afghan de facto authorities have strongly repressed demonstrations, especially those challenging, criticizing or questioning their authority and/or rules. Protestors have been arrested, detained and physically attacked for their participation in demonstrations. Terrorist groups may also target large gatherings.

* Exercise caution
* Avoid all areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Landmines and unexploded ordnance

Despite clearing efforts, landmines and unexploded ordnance from past wars still pose hazards throughout the country.

* Be extremely vigilant, especially in remote areas
* Stay on paved and main roads
* Cross only at official border crossings
* Pay attention to signs indicating the possible presence of unexploded ordnance

If you encounter unexploded ordnance:

* do not get close to or touch them
* move away immediately
* contact the relevant authorities

### Roads

#### Road safety

Drivers are aggressive, reckless and often drive at excessive speeds. They usually don’t respect traffic laws, and Afghan police do not enforce them.

Fatal accidents are common.

#### Road conditions

Road conditions are poor throughout the country due to:

* poor maintenance
* potholes
* unpaved roads
* pedestrians and bicycles on the road
* poorly maintained vehicles

#### Overland travel and adventure tourism

Overland travel is extremely dangerous, including in Kabul. Terrorist and criminal groups often set up fake checkpoints and roadblocks with the intent of committing robbery, kidnapping or other violent attacks.

You should avoid engaging in adventure tourism in Afghanistan, especially in remote areas, and even if you are on a guided tour with a reputable company. There have been attacks in tourist areas by armed and terrorist groups that have resulted in civilian casualties, including foreigners.

Border crossings may close on short notice and are at high risk of terrorist attacks and armed clashes.

Military and police forces are ineffective.

* Avoid undertaking overland travel unless you’re accompanied by vetted and armed security guards
* Always travel in groups

### Women’s safety

Women are at a particularly higher risk of harassment and abuse, including from the authorities. The de facto authorities enforce specific rules and behaviors for women, including:

* travelling and going to public places only with a male guardian (mahram), such as a brother, father or husband
* covering from head-to-toe
* refraining from having their voices heard

Women will likely face challenges when trying to interact with authorities.

Women are expressly prohibited from many places, including:

* public parks
* amusement parks
* public baths
* Band-e-Amir National Park

Some regions enforce restrictions imposed on women and girls more strictly than others. Kandahar province is particularly strictly.

Afghan de facto authorities have detained women who have reported sexual assaults. Women must prove that the act was not consensual to avoid criminal charges under extramarital laws. Legal and medical services are not widely available for women in the event of sexual assault.
