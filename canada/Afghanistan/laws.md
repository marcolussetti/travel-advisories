## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Illegal or restricted activities

The Afghan de facto authorities strictly enforce their interpretation of Islam. The legal system is run by Sharia law. The severity of its enforcement could vary from one province to another.

#### Extramarital relations

Extramarital relations, including sexual relations are illegal. Convicted offenders face severe punishment, such as:

* arrest and detention
* corporal punishment
* the death penalty

#### Restrictions imposed on women

The Afghan de facto authorities strictly enforce their interpretation of Islam and prohibit women from:

* travelling and going to public places, such as parks and restaurants, without a male guardian (mahram)
* looking at unrelated men’s body and/or face
* accessing higher education
* working outside their home
* working for non-governmental organizations and the United Nations
* having their voices heard in public

Women who don’t cover from head-to-toe are likely to be arrested and face jail sentences.

#### Restrictions imposed on men

Men must also abide by strict rules related to their dress and behaviour, including:

* wearing loose clothing covering their waist down to their knees
* growing a beard at least the width of a fist
* not looking at unrelated women’s body and/or face

If you don’t comply with local laws, you could face fines and imprisonment. Enforcers of the law may also arbitrarily determine a punishment that they consider appropriate.

If you travel to Afghanistan despite the advisory in effect:

* dress conservatively
* behave discreetly
* respect local traditions, customs, laws and religion

#### Activism

Activism is prohibited and all forms of communication are closely scrutinized in Afghanistan. If you discuss, share or publish information critical of the de facto authorities, including on social media, you may face:

* increased surveillance and harassment
* arrest
* lengthy detention

#### Religious proselytism

Religious proselytism is illegal in Afghanistan. This includes preaching, possessing, or distributing religious literature or material. If you convert or try to convert someone from Islam to another religion, you could face harsh punishment, including the death sentence. Individuals practicing a religion other than Islam have been arbitrarily arrested, detained and physically attacked or abused.

#### Blasphemy

You could be accused of blasphemy if you engage in religious activities that contradict or challenge the Afghan de facto authorities’ extreme interpretation of Islamic teachings and values. Such acts are punishable by lengthy jail sentences and even the death sentence.

#### Photography

It’s illegal to take photographs of government buildings, military installations and personnel and palaces. Seek permission before taking photographs.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Afghanistan.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of Afghanistan, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Afghanistan.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Afghanistan by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Afghanistan to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Money

The currency is the Afghan afghani (AFN).

Afghanistan is a cash-based economy. Credit cards are not widely accepted. U.S. dollars are accepted, but carry bills that are in good shape, as worn U.S. bills may not be accepted.

There are ATMs in major cities, but none or very few in rural areas.
