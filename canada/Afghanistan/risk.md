### Afghanistan - AVOID ALL TRAVEL

[Avoid all travel](#levels "Risk Levels") to Afghanistan due to the volatile security situation, terrorist attacks, ongoing armed conflict, the risk of kidnapping, arbitrary arrest and detention, the high crime rate, and widespread violations of human rights by the de facto authorities.

The security situation remains highly volatile and dangerous. If you are in Afghanistan, exercise caution if you need to move to a more secure location and review your personal security plans. Keep in mind that you are responsible for your own safety and that of your family.

The Embassy of Canada in Afghanistan has suspended its operations. Our ability to provide consular assistance and other support in this country is extremely limited.

If you have successfully made your way out of the country and require consular assistance, contact the nearest Canadian government office.

We strongly recommend that you sign up with the [Registration of Canadians Abroad service](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/registration) to receive important information.
