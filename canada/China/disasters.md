## Natural disasters and climate

### Climate change

Climate change is affecting China. Extreme and unusual weather events are becoming more frequent and may affect your travel plans. Monitor local news to stay informed on the current situation.

### Typhoons and monsoons

The typhoon and monsoon (rainy) season extends from April to October. Typhoons usually occur along the southern and eastern coasts. During this period, even small storms can quickly develop into major typhoons.

Flooding is common in central, western and southern China, particularly areas bordering the Yangtze River. Seasonal flooding and landslides can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable and bridges damaged.

If you decide to travel to China during the typhoon and monsoon season:

* know that you expose yourself to serious safety risks
* be prepared to change your travel plans on short notice, including cutting short or cancelling your trip
* stay informed of the latest regional weather forecasts
* carry emergency contact information for your airline or tour operator
* follow the advice and instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders

### Air pollution

Air pollution can be severe across much of China.

Some cities maintain air pollution alert systems. During periods of severe air pollution, expect school closures, outdoor event cancellations, car usage limitations and transportation disruptions.

Monitor air pollution levels, which change quickly.

During periods of high pollution:

* limit your activities outdoors
* monitor local media
* follow the instructions of local authorities.

### Seismic activity

China is located in an active seismic zone and is prone to earthquakes.

Familiarize yourself with the security measures in place at your accommodations while in China. In the event of an earthquake, pay careful attention to all official warnings and follow evacuation orders issued by the Government of China. Aftershocks could occur.

### Avalanches and landslides

In mountainous regions, avalanches and landslides present a risk and have resulted in fatalities.

The Karakoram and Khunjerab Pass routes in Xinjiang can be hazardous due to landslides.

Monitor local media and weather forecasts and follow the advice of local authorities.
