## Safety and security

### Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region

Local authorities have put in place invasive security measures in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Chinese authorities are increasingly detaining ethnic and Muslim minorities in the region without due process. There are reports of extrajudicial internment and forced labour camps. Family members of Canadian citizens with Chinese citizenship have been detained. You may be at risk of arbitrary detention if you have familial or ethnic ties to the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region.

The situation in the region is tense and accurate information is hard to obtain. Authorities may impose curfews and restrictions on short notice.

* Avoid gatherings and demonstrations
* Always carry ID
* Expect a heightened security presence and frequent security checks
* Expect significant travel delays
* Follow the instructions of local authorities.

### Tibet and Tibetan autonomous prefectures

You must obtain a permit and be taking part in an organized tour to travel to Tibet. Chinese authorities occasionally suspend issuing permits to foreigners and can arbitrarily deny tourist entry to certain districts and communes of the Tibetan autonomous prefectures in Sichuan and Qinghai, despite not having proactively published notification of these changes. If you enter a restricted area without the requisite permit, you could be fined, taken into custody, and deported for illegal entry.  Local authorities may also impose curfews and travel restrictions on short notice, even if you have a permit.

Where possible, make full payment for travel conditional upon a travel permit being secured while noting that changes in Tibet's security situation can affect travel and related government policies at any time.

In these regions, expect:

* increased security measures and police presence
* surveillance measures
* that unauthorised gatherings may be dispersed by force
* that some places of worship or cultural sites of interest may be off-limits to foreigners

If you travel to these regions despite the risks:

* contact a reputable travel agency and the Chinese Embassy or a consulate before you leave to learn about entry requirements
* be aware of your surroundings
* exercise caution due to increased scrutiny on foreigners
* follow the instructions of security forces if you are stopped
* if you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the Canadian Embassy or the nearest consulate immediately
* don't film or photograph unauthorised gatherings or outbreaks of violence

Our ability to provide consular support in the Tibet Autonomous Region is limited.

Check with the Embassy of the People's Republic of China to know about the specific entry requirements for Tibet and other restricted areas.

### Crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing, purse snatching and theft of mobile phones and other electronic devices occurs, even during the day. Criminals target foreigners, especially in major cities and tourist areas.

* Be vigilant in all crowded locations
* Don't carry large sums of money
* Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times

Petty crime and sexual harassment can occur on buses and overnight trains.

* Ensure that the train compartment contains packages belonging only to you and other occupants
* Store personal belongings in a safe place, and don't leave the compartment unattended
* You should securely lock the doors

Serious crime against foreigners is relatively rare, but incidents do occur.

There is a risk of armed bandit attacks in remote parts of China.

Police presence may be poor around border areas.

### Fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud occurs. Be cautious when using debit or credit cards:

* pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others
* use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

#### Counterfeit currency

Counterfeit currency is a significant problem in China. Counterfeit bills are widely distributed in local stores, restaurants and taxis. If you use cash, avoid moneychangers on the street and use small bills or exact change.

#### Scams

Exercise caution in popular tourist areas (particularly in Beijing's Tiananmen Square and Shanghai's the Bund, East Nanjing Road and People's Square), where scammers target foreigners.

Scammers may invite you to a nearby establishment for a drink (usually tea or alcohol), a massage or other services. They will then ask you to pay an exorbitant bill (up to thousands of dollars), sometimes under threat of injury. In some cases, foreigners were harmed.

Be cautious of unsolicited requests from strangers to “practice English” or to accompany them to an art gallery, teahouse or an unknown location.

If you've been scammed:

* get to a safe location immediately
* take note, as soon as possible of the name and address of the facility where you were held; this information is required by police to identify the persons involved and issue a report
* notify the police and obtain a report
* call your credit card company to report the scam; they will likely request a copy of the police report to cancel the transaction

#### Telephone scams

Foreigners have received calls from scammers claiming to be the police. The caller says that local authorities are investigating them for identity theft or money-laundering operation and requests a fund transfer to resolve the issue.

Don't send any money in this type of situation.

Since most Chinese use their mobile device as payment method, digital and mobile phone scams are a common issue. You should be vigilant if you use your smartphone to scan, transfer funds or make payments.

### Spiked food and drinks

Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

### Internet censorship and cyber security

China blocks access to several websites, social media, search engines and online services within its territory.

You shouldn't expect internet privacy. Your communications may be monitored at any time, and authorities may review the content stored or consulted on your electronic devices.

### Journalism and research

Foreign journalists and other media workers in China face considerable restrictions in the context of their work. The Chinese government may employ measures such as:

* movement controls
* physical and electronic surveillance
* public smear campaigns
* delaying or refusing renewals of press cards and visas
* intimidation and harassment.

There are cases of foreign journalist arrests on national security violations.

You should be particularly vigilant if researching or reporting on subjects critical of or sensitive to the government and in areas such as Tibet or Xinjiang.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations are illegal without prior approval from the Chinese government. Authorized and unauthorized demonstrations can take place with little or no notice. They can quickly spread to surrounding areas, including those frequented by tourists.

If you participate in or are witness to a demonstration, you may be subject to scrutiny and severe legal action. Foreign journalists have experienced intimidation and detention for reporting on demonstrations.

The security situation around large gatherings could change quickly. Be vigilant about your safety.

You should be particularly vigilant in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and the Tibet Autonomous Region.

* Don't film or take pictures of demonstrations
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations
* Follow the instructions of local authorities

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety can vary greatly throughout the country. Drivers often don't respect the rules of the road, and traffic laws are not consistently enforced.

Be cautious when crossing streets, as drivers don't always give pedestrians and cyclists the right of way.

### Public transportation

China has an extensive passenger train system, including high-speed trains. You must present a passport to purchase a ticket and to board the train.

#### Taxis

Taxis are available in major cities and are easier to obtain at hotels or taxi stands. Self-drive (rental), chauffeur-driven cars and ride-sharing services are also available in major cities.

Most taxi drivers don't speak English nor French and will sometimes avoid picking up foreigners to avoid the inconvenience of clients who don't speak Chinese. You should arrange for a person to write out your destination in Chinese characters before you go.

Taxi, motorcycle and pedicab drivers sometimes overcharge clients, especially at airports. They may also attempt to give you counterfeit currency.

To minimize the risk of being overcharged:

* use only reputable taxis
* avoid unlicensed “black taxis”
* do not agree to multiple passengers
* negotiate fares before entering the taxi, and/or request that the taxi driver use the meter
* request that the driver provides you with a receipt or “fapiao”
* request that the driver removes your luggage from the trunk before paying the fare

#### Marine transportation

Ferry accidents have occurred in China.

* Exercise caution when using marine transportation
* Always use available safety equipment, such as life jackets and seatbelts
* Don't board ferries that appear overloaded or unseaworthy.

### Air travel

We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.

### Trekking

If you intend on engaging in trekking activities:

* never do so alone and always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* ensure that you are properly equipped and well informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary, including when you expect to be back to camp
* know the symptoms of acute altitude sickness, which can be fatal
* obtain detailed information on trekking routes before setting out and do not venture off marked trails or slopes

### Piracy

Pirate attacks and armed robbery against ships occur in coastal waters, and in some cases, farther out at sea. Mariners should take appropriate precautions.

### Tensions on Korean Peninsula

Tensions on the neighbouring Korean Peninsula could escalate with little notice, and the security situation could deteriorate suddenly.

Tensions may increase before, during and after North Korean nuclear and missile tests, military exercises or as the result of incidents or military activities at or near the inter-Korean border.

Monitor developments, remain vigilant and follow the instructions of local authorities. We strongly recommend that you register with the Registration of Canadians Abroad service to receive the latest updates.
