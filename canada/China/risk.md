### China - Exercise a high degree of caution

[Exercise a high degree of caution](#levels "Risk Levels") in China due to the risk of arbitrary enforcement of local laws.

Our ability to provide consular assistance in China is limited due to the level of transparency in Chinaâ€™s judicial system. It may also impact your ability to obtain effective legal assistance.

In China, you may also be subject to:

* severe punishments, even for non-violent acts such as financial crimes. Chinese authorities may also apply the death penalty for crimes deemed serious, including drug offences
* an exit ban, which you may only learn about as you go through customs and immigration controls when trying to leave China. An exit ban may prevent you from leaving the country if you, your family or your employer and/or business associates are involved in any open civil or criminal investigations, including business disputes

If you are a dual citizen, you should always travel using your valid Canadian passport and present yourself as Canadian to Chinese authorities. If you enter China on a Chinese passport or identity card, the Chinese government may consider you a citizen of China, and refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services.
