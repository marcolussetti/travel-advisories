# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

The authorities of a country or territory decide who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Chinese authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country's entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months upon entry into China.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

You should also be aware that current systems used by some countries and travel companies may not recognize the “X” gender identifier. You may still be asked to provide your sex/gender information as either male or female when travelling.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Visas

Tourist visa: not required   
Business visa: not required   
Student visa: required   
Working visa: required

Ensure that you apply for the proper type of visa for the specific purpose of your trip.

Thoroughly review all information available regarding the visa-issuance process.

Pay particular attention to the length of stay permitted after each entry on your Chinese visa. Overstaying can lead to fines and administrative detention.

#### Visa-free entry

From February 17 to December 31, 2026, Canadian passport holders are included in China's visa waiver travel scheme. During this period, you may be eligible for visa‑free entry for up to 30 days for tourism, business, family visits or transit during this period. Always verify your eligibility with the nearest Chinese embassy or consulate. If you don't meet the criteria for visa-free travel, make sure you have the appropriate visa before travelling to mainland China.

#### Entry to Tibet

Unaccompanied private visits to Tibet are still prohibited. Foreigners may visit Tibet through an accredited travel agency, which can obtain the Tibet Travel Permit on their behalf.

Check with the Embassy of the People's Republic of China to know about the specific entry requirements for Tibet and other restricted areas.

#### Visa application outside of Canada

If you apply for a visa outside of Canada, check with the Chinese embassy or consulate nearest you to make sure that it issues visas to Canadians.

If you are already travelling or living in China, contact the Foreigners Entry and Exit Administration Section of the local Public Security Bureau (PSB) for visa information.

### Proof of onward travel

Be prepared to show proof of onward travel, including all of the documents you need to enter your next destination.

### Fingerprints

Chinese immigration officials will take and retain the fingerprints of Canadians between 14 and 70 years old upon their entry into the country. Some exceptions may apply.

### Screening of digital devices

Border officials may review the content stored or consulted on your electronic devices, particularly at border crossings between mainland China and Hong Kong.

### Residency registration

All foreigners (tourists, visitors and long-term residents) must register their place of residence with the local public security bureau within 24 hours of arrival.

If you’re staying in a hotel, registration is normally done as part of the check-in process. Those staying with family or friends in a private home must register themselves. Failure to do so can result in fines and or detention. Carry proof of your registration.

Foreigners holding Z, X or J-1 visas must also apply for a residence permit, within 30 days of entry, from the Exit and Entry Department of the local public security bureau.

### Health entry requirements

Medical tests, including a test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, might be required to register and renew residency permits for stays of more than 6 months. Local authorities may not approve your work/residence permit application if you obtain an HIV-positive test result. You may also be subject to termination of employment and deportation.

### Yellow fever

Learn about [potential entry requirements related to yellow fever](#health) (vaccines section).

### Exit bans

Chinese authorities may place an exit ban on specific individuals. An exit ban may prevent you from leaving the country if you, your family or your employer and/or business associates are involved in any open civil or criminal investigations, including business disputes.

You may only learn that authorities have placed an exit ban on you as you go through customs and immigration controls when trying to leave China. It is difficult to obtain information on bans from Chinese authorities.

If you’re unable to leave the country because of an exit ban, consult a lawyer and contact the closest office of the Government of Canada.
