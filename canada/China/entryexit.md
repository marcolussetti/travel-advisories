# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Chinese authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months upon entry into China.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Visas

Tourist visa: required   
Business visa: required   
Student visa: required   
Working visa: required

Ensure that you apply for the proper type of visa for the specific purpose of your trip.

Thoroughly review all information available regarding the visa-issuance process.

Pay particular attention to the length of stay permitted after each entry on your Chinese visa. Overstaying can lead to fines and administrative detention.

#### Transit without visa and visa-free stays

While you may be eligible for a visa on arrival, there is no guarantee that it will be granted. You should obtain a visa before travelling to China.

You may be eligible for a visa on arrival if you are:

* transiting between two international destinations
* visiting certain areas for short periods
* visiting certain areas as part of an organized tour or travelling in a group

Contact the nearest Chinese diplomatic or consular office for more information on visa exemptions.

#### Visa application outside of Canada

If you apply for a visa outside of Canada, check with the Chinese embassy or consulate nearest you to make sure that it issues visas to Canadians.

If you are already travelling or living in China, contact the Foreigners Entry and Exit Administration Section of the local Public Security Bureau (PSB) for visa information.

#### Visiting Hong Kong and Macao

Obtain a visa allowing multiple entries if you plan to travel between Hong Kong, Macao and mainland China.

### Proof of onward travel

Be prepared to show proof of onward travel, including all of the documents you need to enter your next destination.

### Fingerprints

Chinese immigration officials will take and retain the fingerprints of Canadians between 14 and 70 years old upon their entry into the country. Some exceptions may apply.

### Screening of digital devices

Border officials may review the content stored or consulted on your electronic devices, particularly at border crossings between mainland China and Hong Kong.

### Residency registration

All foreigners (tourists, visitors and long-term residents) must register their place of residence with the local public security bureau within 24 hours of arrival.

If you’re staying in a hotel, registration is normally done as part of the check-in process. Those staying with family or friends in a private home must register themselves. Failure to do so can result in fines and or detention. Carry proof of your registration.

Foreigners holding Z, X or J-1 visas must also apply for a residence permit, within 30 days of entry, from the Exit and Entry Department of the local public security bureau.

### Health entry requirements

Medical tests, including a test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, might be required to register and renew residency permits for stays of more than 6 months. Local authorities may not approve your work/residence permit application if you obtain an HIV-positive test result. You may also be subject to termination of employment and deportation.

### Yellow fever

Learn about [potential entry requirements related to yellow fever](#health) (vaccines section).

### Exit bans

Chinese authorities may place an exit ban on specific individuals to prevent them from leaving the country. An exit ban can relate to investigations into an individual, their family or an employer, and in criminal and civil matters, including business disputes.

You may not be aware that authorities have placed an exit ban on you until you try to leave the country. It is difficult to obtain information on bans from Chinese authorities.

If you’re unable to leave the country because of an exit ban, consult a lawyer and contact the closest office of the Government of Canada.
