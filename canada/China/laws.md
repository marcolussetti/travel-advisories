## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws and there is a risk of arbitrary enforcement.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](https://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Criminal proceedings

If you are suspected of a crime, Chinese authorities can prevent you from leaving China (by withholding your passport or applying an exit ban) or may detain you for up to 37 days without charges.

You may also be subject to severe punishments, including for non-violent acts such as financial crimes. Chinese authorities may also apply the death penalty for crimes deemed serious, including drug offences.

Detention during the investigative period before charges are laid is common and can be lengthy. Some defence lawyers may be reluctant to accept cases involving foreigners.

Our ability to provide consular assistance in China is limited due to China’s judicial system. It may also impact your ability to obtain effective legal assistance.

If you are a dual citizen, you should always travel using your valid Canadian passport and present yourself as Canadian to Chinese authorities. If you enter China on a Chinese passport or identity card, the Chinese government may consider you a citizen of China and refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services.

### Death penalty

Chinese authorities apply, sometimes arbitrarily, the death penalty for both violent and non-violent crimes, including for serious drug offences.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use, production or trafficking of illegal drugs, including cannabis, are severe. Convicted offenders can expect heavy fines, jail sentences or the death penalty. These laws are strictly enforced and apply to persons 14 years and older. Penalties can be assigned arbitrarily.

Local authorities conduct random drug tests (urine or hair). Police have raided nightclubs and bars and subjected patrons to on-the-spot drug testing.

Based on positive drug test results, authorities can prosecute drugs crimes regardless of where or when drugs were consumed. This applies to drugs consumed legally in a foreign country before entering China.

[Drugs, alcohol and travel](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/drugs)

### Identification

Police carry out random checks, and failure to produce proper identification could potentially lead to fines or detention.

* Carry adequate identification, such as a passport and valid visa or residence permit, at all times
* Keep a photocopy of your passport in case of its loss or seizure

If your passport is lost or stolen, visit the nearest police station or Public Security Bureau to report the incident and obtain information on the visa replacement process.

If you renew your passport while you are in China, you must register your new passport with the authorities promptly. If you fail to do so, you may be fined.

### National security, social order, and public interest

Chinese authorities may define certain behaviours and activities as “endangering national security,” upsetting social order, or damaging the public interest, that would not be considered as such in Canada. This could include activities that occurred outside of China. National security, and "state secrets", are broadly defined and interpreted. "State secrets" could be interpreted to include documents, data, materials, or other items. If you are suspected of endangering national security, upsetting social order, or damaging the public interest you will be subject to questioning.

Chinese authorities may detain you for up to 6 months before you are formally arrested. Note that access to legal representation is frequently denied in the initial stages of a national security case, and trials often take place in closed court.

If you are detained, you should immediately request access to a lawyer and request notification of the nearest Canadian diplomatic mission. Canadian diplomatic missions can provide you or your family with a list of lawyers.

If you previously occupied a position that was in any way affiliated with the government of China and left your position without receiving authorization or without following formal procedures, you may be considered a defector by Chinese authorities.

This can be the case regardless of the seniority of the position you occupied, even if you left this position a long time ago and you did not handle sensitive or classified materials. Authorities may detain you even if you have previously travelled to or resided in China without issue.

Consult a Chinese criminal lawyer to understand how this may apply to you.

### Bans and Sanctions

The Chinese government may ban or sanction entities or individuals for actions, including oral or written statements, and associations with entities that are critical of:

* the Communist Party of China
* the Chinese government
* Chinese leaders and policies

The Government of the People's Republic of China does not publicize a list of banned or sanctioned entities or individuals, and the implementation of bans or sanctions remains vague. The effect on individuals associated with banned or sanctioned entities is unknown.

It could include:

* a ban on travel to Mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau
* freezing of assets
* prohibition of business or association with Chinese citizens and organizations

If you believe you may be subject of a ban or sanctions, consult a lawyer and contact the closest office of the Government of Canada.

Consult [entry and exit requirements](https://travel.gc.ca/destinations/china#entryexit) for information on exit bans

### Political activities

China has imposed severe restrictions on political activities, including advocating for causes, participating in public protests or sending private electronic messages critical of the government.

Chinese authorities may detain you if you participate in political activities and restrict your future travel to China.

### Non-Governmental Organization activities

Activities conducted by foreign non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are strictly regulated and scrutinized in China.

If you plan to work or volunteer for an NGO in China, ensure the organization is properly registered and that you possess the right visa for the activities you plan to perform.

### Religious activities

There are restrictions on certain religious activities, such as preaching, distributing literature and associating with unapproved religious groups, including some Christian, Buddhist and Muslim organizations.

Chinese law also prohibits overseas non-governmental organizations from engaging in or sponsoring religious activities.

The Falun Gong movement is banned in China. Participants in Falun Gong activities or Falun Gong-related demonstrations are subject to legal action that may include detention, arrest, imprisonment and deportation.

Be cautious about visiting certain places of worship, which may have been, explicitly or not, declared off-limits to foreigners by local authorities. If you are not prompted to buy a ticket to visit the site, it could be an indication that the site is off-limits to foreigners.

### Facial recognition and use of video surveillance (CCTV)

Law enforcement agencies in China widely rely on facial recognition technology and video surveillance to police, monitor and control illegal or restricted activities, including participation in demonstrations.

Privacy rights may differ substantially from Canadian standards. You should assume that local authorities have access to your biometrics as soon as you enter the country.

### Military installations

Travel near military installations is restricted. Photography of military installations or government buildings is prohibited, and offenders may be detained, arrested and imprisoned.

Seek permission from local authorities before taking photographs.

### Gambling

Gambling and the promotion of gambling activities are illegal in mainland China.

### Surrogacy

Commercial surrogacy is illegal in China, and surrogacy arrangements are not legally recognized.

If you're planning to visit China for the purpose of commissioning surrogacy arrangements, you should consider the potential challenges involved in pursuing international surrogacy and seek specialist legal advice on Chinese and Canadian laws prior to making any arrangements.

The Embassy of Canada to China can't provide recommendations on surrogacy arrangements.

### Prohibited or controlled items

There are absolute prohibitions against the importation of arms, drugs and plant or animal products that could carry disease or pests. There are also restrictions on the entry of printed material, film, photos, videotapes, and CDs considered detrimental to China's interests.

#### Drones

Importation and use of drones are subject to strict regulation. Contact the Civil Aviation Administration of China to consult the rules regarding registration and use of drones.

#### Importing pets

If you intend to reside in China, be advised that you can only import one pet (dog or cat) per person.

A Canadian animal health inspection certificate and vaccination certificate should be stamped by your local Animal Health Office of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.

Animals without the proper documentation will be held in quarantine at the port of arrival and could be euthanized if the proper documentation is not provided.

### Getting married in China

Marriages that are legally performed in China are usually valid in Canada. Chinese civil authorities don't perform marriages between two foreigners. If you plan to get married in China, you should contact the nearest Chinese diplomatic representative in Canada to confirm the requirements.

[Marriage overseas](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/documents/marriage-overseas)

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Chinese law does not prohibit sexual acts between individuals of the same sex.

However, some prejudice still exists against 2SLGBTQI+ communities, and authorities sometimes censor social media content on 2SLGBTQI+ related topics.

### Driving

Canadian and international driving licences are not recognized in China. You must hold a foreigner residence permit and meet local requirements to obtain a Chinese driver's licence.

Penalties for drinking and driving are severe. The legal blood alcohol limit is 0.02%. If a police officer suspects you of drinking and driving, they could confiscate your driver's licence on the spot. If you're convicted, you can expect heavy fines and jail.

Foreign drivers involved in an accident face harsh penalties. If you're suspected of being responsible for road accidents, police officers can detain you until their case is closed, which can take years.

Carefully consider the implications of driving in China.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in China.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of China, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

You should always travel using your valid Canadian passport and present yourself as Canadian to foreign authorities at all times to minimize this risk. If you enter China on a Chinese passport or identity card, the Chinese government will usually not permit the Embassy of Canada to provide you with consular assistance.

If you're a Canadian of Chinese origin travelling to China, you may be asked to provide your Chinese name by border authorities. Ensure that you are well informed about Chinese law and practices relating to the determination and loss of Chinese citizenship, including cancelling a household register (hukou) and applying to renounce Chinese citizenship. Contact the nearest Chinese diplomatic or consular office for more details.

Canadian children born to at least one parent who is a Chinese citizen may be deemed Chinese citizens under China's Nationality Law. Chinese authorities may not recognize the child's Canadian citizenship, and the family may be subject to family planning regulations.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and China.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in China by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in China to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Doing business in China

Canadian business travellers have been detained and had their passport confiscated as a result of business disputes with their Chinese counterparts.

Seek legal advice from professionals in China, as well as in Canada, before proceeding with business agreements or arrangements. Ensure that all documents are translated so that conditions, terms and limitations are understood. Disputes are often costly and prolonged, and you may be subject to a travel ban restricting you from leaving the country until the matter is resolved.

There have been incidents involving foreigners being held against their will at their workplace. These incidents, which can be accompanied by threats of violence, are often the result of other companies or disgruntled employees attempting to resolve business and employment disputes.

### Teaching

There are many teaching opportunities in China. However, make sure you are well informed before signing a contract. Ensure that the contract specifies the maximum number of classroom hours per day and per week, maximum workdays per week, and vacation periods.

Canadians teaching in China, particularly at newly established private secondary schools and private English training centres, have often found their employers unable or unwilling to honour contract terms or assist in obtaining Chinese employment visas and other permits required for foreigners to teach lawfully in China.

If you're travelling to China to work or study, you may be required to possess medical insurance (coverage of 400,000 renminbi). Verify this stipulation with the school or employer before arriving in China.

It is illegal to work on a tourist (L) visa or a working (Z) visa linked to a company other than your employer. Canadian citizens have been detained and forced to leave the country for working illegally.

### Studying

Learn about studying abroad if you plan to study or conduct research in China.

[Studying abroad](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/living-abroad/studying)

### Money

The currency is the renminbi (RMB). The basic unit of currency is the yuan.

It is illegal to use foreign currency for everyday transactions. Exchange foreign currency at officially approved facilities only.

Mobile payments are widely used in China. Major Chinese platforms allow foreign travellers to link an international credit card and pay by scanning QR codes in shops, restaurants, taxis and on public transport.

If using these services:

* follow the platform’s official setup instructions
* be cautious when scanning QR codes from unofficial or unfamiliar sources
* verify the charge on your screen before authorizing payment

Cash is now used less frequently in large cities. A small number of counterfeit notes still circulate, but they are most often encountered only in low-volume cash transactions. If you pay in cash:

* use small denominations
* avoid accepting damaged or poor-quality notes
* be particularly attentive when paying or receiving change in taxis or small informal businesses

International credit cards are accepted in many hotels and larger establishments but not universally. ATMs that accept foreign cards are widely available in major cities but may be limited in remote areas. When using ATMs:

* choose machines located inside banks or reputable businesses
* shield the keypad when entering your PIN
* monitor your statements for unauthorized transactions

When entering or leaving China, you must declare to customs if you are carrying USD 5,000 or more, 20 000 RMB or more, or the equivalent in other currencies. The limit applies to cash, cheques, money orders, traveller's cheques or any other convertible assets.

A permit issued by a local bank may be required to leave China with sums superior to USD 5,000 or its equivalent. Make sure you comply with cash control regulations.
