# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and bag snatching, occurs. Thieves target tourists, particularly in crowded public areas such as:

* popular tourist areas, including lookouts
* buses, trains, bus and train stations, and airports
* hotel lobbies
* restaurants, including outdoor seating areas

In Vienna, petty crime is common in the city centre, near St. Stephen's Cathedral, and in and around the major rail stations, the Hauptbahnhof and Westbahnhof, as well as on international trains travelling to and from Austria.

Criminals may try to distract you and take your attention away from your valuables or belongings. Be cautious of distraction tactics, including people who:

* spill drinks on you or your belongings
* engage you in lengthy conversations
* persistently offer to assist you
* attempt to distance you from your personal belongings

During your trip:

* keep your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, in a secure place
* do not carry large sums of cash or valuables unnecessarily
* avoid walking alone after dark
* be aware of your surroundings, especially in busy tourist areas

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in Europe. Terrorists have carried out attacks in several European cities and further attacks are likely.

Targets could include:

* government buildings
* schools, including universities
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners
* cultural venues

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

Be particularly vigilant during:

* sporting events
* religious holidays
* public celebrations

Terrorists may use such occasions to mount attacks.

The Austrian Interior Ministry maintains a public alert system on terrorism. Austria's current threat level is 4, “high”, on a 5-step scale.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations may occur. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

Credit and debit card as well as ATM fraud occurs, particularly in Vienna.

When using your credit or debit card:

* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* pay careful attention when others are handling your cards
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* use ATMs located in public areas or inside a bank or business
* review your account statements for any unauthorized transactions

#### Cybercrime

* Be cautious when posting information or photos on social media
* Use your own USB adaptor or carry an extra battery pack
* Use secure public Wi-Fi networks
* Beware of people who show a keen interest in you online
* Always meet new acquaintances in a secure and familiar location

### Spiked food, drinks and other items

Never leave your food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Avoid accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as these items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

### Adventure tourism

Outdoor activities, such as mountaineering, hiking, mountain biking, skiing, or other alpine and extreme sports, can be dangerous.

If you intend to participate in adventure tourism activities:

* share your itinerary with a friend or family member if you're alone
* buy travel insurance that covers incidents related to this type of recreational activity
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to tackle the challenges of your activity
* know the symptoms of acute altitude sickness, dehydration and heatstroke, which can be fatal
* ensure that you have proper equipment and bring sufficient water
* monitor weather conditions and other possible hazards, including avalanches
* refrain from using equipment if you are unsure of its condition or safety

Avalanches can occur in mountainous areas, especially in early and late winter. Pay careful attention to warning signs and consider carrying an avalanche beacon.

### Roads

Mountain roads are often narrow and covered with snow and ice during winter. Roads may close due to avalanches. Carry tire chains in the car if you intend to use mountain roads.
