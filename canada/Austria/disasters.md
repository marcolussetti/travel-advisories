### Avalanches

There is a risk of avalanches in mountain environments. They can damage buildings and roads. This is especially a concern following heavy snowfalls. Some have resulted in deaths.

Be particularly careful in the alpine areas of Salzburg, Styria, Tyrol and Vorarlberg.

There are seven regional avalanche warning services in Austria. The University of Vienna provides LAWIS, a public tool combining data from all seven regional systems into one platform available to the public.

Always carefully follow the advice of local authorities.
