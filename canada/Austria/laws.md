## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Transfer to a Canadian prison

Canada and Austria are signatories to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in Austria to request a transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both Canadian and Austrian authorities.

This process can take a long time, and there is no guarantee that the transfer will be approved by either or both sides.

### Identification checks

You must carry identification, such as your passport, at all times. Keep a photocopy or digital copy of your passport in a secure location in case of loss or seizure.

### Face covering

It is illegal to wear clothing or masks that partially or completely cover the face in public places. Failure to comply can result in arrest and a fine. Certain exemptions apply, see the Austrian government’s website for more information.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect a jail sentence and a heavy fine.

### Dual citizenship

Austria only recognizes dual citizenship in certain cases.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Austria, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you’re there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](https://travel.gc.ca/destinations/austria#entryexit).

Canadians with dual citizenship or who are eligible for Austrian citizenship may be subject to compulsory military service and other requirements under Austrian law.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Austria.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Austria, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Austrian court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Austria to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Driving

You can drive for up to 12 months with your valid Canadian driver’s licence, accompanied by an international driving permit or an official German translation of your licence.

You must be 18 years old to drive in Austria.

Penalties for drinking and driving are severe. The legal blood alcohol limit is 0.05 percent. If convicted, you can expect heavy fines, and local authorities can confiscate your driver’s licence immediately.

You cannot turn right on a red light. A blinking green light is equivalent to an amber light in Canada: it doesn’t mean that you have the right-of-way to advance.

#### Mandatory equipment

Winter tires are mandatory from November 1 to April 15.

All vehicles must have the following in case of a breakdown:

* a first-aid kit
* a warning triangle
* high-visibility vests (to be carried in the passenger compartment, not the trunk) which must be worn by the driver and any passenger who leaves the vehicle

#### Vignette

You must purchase an autobahn vignette (similar to a toll) sticker to drive on highways. You must affix the sticker to the car’s windshield. You can purchase a vignette at all major border crossings, gas stations and convenience stores across Austria.

You can also purchase a digital vignette online from ASFiNAG, the state-owned highways corporation.

If you do not purchase and display a vignette, you will be fined on the spot.

### Drones

Austrian and EU laws regulate recreational and commercial drone operation. Certain areas are restricted or off-limits for personal drones.

You must register as a drone operator with the Austrian authorities. Depending on the size of your drone and the intended use, you may also need to take a proof of competency exam.

If you don’t comply, you may be fined and your drone confiscated.

### Money

The currency of Austria is the euro (EUR).

Credit cards are widely accepted at main hotels, shops and restaurants. Smaller establishments may only accept cash.

If you are carrying €10,000 or more, or the equivalent in other currencies or monetary instruments, you must make a declaration to customs when you enter or leave the European Union.

This does not apply if you are travelling within the European Union or in transit to a non-EU country.
