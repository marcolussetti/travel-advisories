# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Ongoing hostilities in the Middle East

Missiles, drones and other projectiles have struck targets in the region. Military debris has fallen in various locations.

You should be particularly vigilant near military installations.

There have been disruptions to movement and transportation, including:

* border closures or restrictions
* flight cancellations
* airspace closures

The security situation could deteriorate significantly without notice.

You should:

* monitor local and international media to stay informed of the rapidly evolving situation
* be vigilant and follow the instructions of local authorities at all times, including any orders to shelter in place
* sign up with the [Registration of Canadians Abroad](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/registration "https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/registration") service to receive important information about the crisis
* ensure that your travel documents and those of your family are up to date

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism. Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners
* Western interests in and around Manama

Increased security measures are currently in place and may be reinforced upon short notice. Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

### Crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching occurs. Violent crime is rare.

* Ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Exercise caution in the old market areas (souks), villages and poorer districts, especially after dark

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations take place regularly, particularly on evenings and weekends. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. Participants have been known to throw rocks, Molotov cocktails and use makeshift explosive devices during protests. Police have historically used tear gas and stun grenades to disperse crowds.

Areas prone to demonstrations include:

* Sitra
* Bani Jamra
* Karbabad
* Saar
* Karzakan
* the Budaiya Highway and surrounding villages.

Demonstrations can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Women’s safety

Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse.

Women have been detained when reporting sexual assault, as they must prove that the sex was not consensual to avoid being charged under extramarital sex statutes.

### Telecommunications

Cellular phone coverage may not be available in some parts of the country.

### Road safety

Road conditions are very good throughout the country. Drivers, however, are often aggressive. Drifting sands and roaming animals can pose hazards.

Off-road driving can be hazardous.

* Only go off-road driving in a convoy of four-wheel-drive vehicles and with an experienced guide
* Leave your itinerary with a family member or friend
* Be well prepared, and carry extra gasoline, water, food and a cellular phone

In the event of an accident resulting in injuries, do not move your vehicle until a report has been filed, even if the vehicle impedes traffic. If there are injuries, call 999; if there are no injuries, call 199.

### Taxis

Taxis are generally safe.

* Use only officially marked taxis
* Negotiate fares in advance, or insist that the driver use the meter, as you may be overcharged

### Air travel

We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.

### Sea travel

There is a curfew in effect on the waterways around Bahrain from 6 p.m. to 4 a.m. Vessels operating in these waters may be detained and inspected, even outside curfew hours.

Regional tension may affect your travel. Exercise caution in the following areas, as vessels have been subject to detention, inspection and attacks:

* Gulf of Oman
* Northern Arabian Sea
* Gulf of Aden
* Bab El Mandeb

Exercise increased caution when travelling by dhow (small sailboat), as they may not be up to Canadian safety standards.
