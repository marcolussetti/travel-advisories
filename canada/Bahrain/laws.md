## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect lengthy jail sentences, heavy fines, as well as the death penalty. The possession of even a very small amount of drugs can result in arrest and, if convicted, a four-year minimum prison term.

Alcohol is available for purchase by non-Muslims at special stores. However, Bahraini attitudes regarding alcohol are not favourable. Observe restrictions concerning the consumption of alcohol. Excessive drinking while in transit through a Bahraini airport could lead to detention and a fine.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Bahraini law does not prohibit sexual acts between individuals of the same sex. However, the Bahraini government does not recognize same-sex marriage, and homosexuality is not widely socially accepted. 2SLGBTQI+ persons could face arrest under other charges, such as morality or public decency laws.

2SLGBTQI+ persons should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Bahrain.

### Social Media

In June 2017, when Bahrain cut diplomatic ties with Qatar, it also announced that any expression of sympathy for Qatar on social media or by any other means of communication is an offence. Transgression could result in imprisonment or a fine.

### Identification

You must carry photo identification. Under Bahraini law, failure to produce photo identification to an authority when asked is considered an offence and you may be fined. Keep a photocopy of your passport in a safe place, in case it’s lost or confiscated.

### Photography

Do not take photographs of buildings or individuals without prior authorization.

### Marriage

Common-law unions are tolerated but not recognized. Extramarital relations are illegal.

### Customs

Bahraini customs authorities may enforce strict regulations concerning the temporary import or export of certain items, including firearms, ammunition and other weapons, seditious literature and habit-forming drugs.

### Legal process

If you are involved in Bahraini court proceedings due to indebtedness, labour disagreement or other legal dispute, you may be prevented from leaving the country until your case is resolved.

### Dress and behaviour

Bahrain’s customs, laws and regulations adhere closely to Islamic practices and beliefs. The work week is from Sunday to Thursday.

Religious proselytizing is not permitted.

You may be subject to heavy fines if you show disrespect toward officials by making verbal insults and obscene gestures.

* Avoid physical contact, such as holding hands with another adult, in public
* Dress conservatively
* Behave discreetly
* Respect religious and social traditions to avoid offending local sensitivities. For example, women should cover their arms and legs, and men should not wear shorts in public

### Ramadan

In 2025, the lunar month of Ramadan is expected to begin on or around February 28.

In public, between sunrise and sunset, be discreet when:

* drinking
* eating
* smoking

### Pornography

Possession of pornographic material is forbidden.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Bahrain.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of Bahrain, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

### Family law

Child custody decisions are based on Islamic law. It is extremely difficult for a Canadian woman, even if she is Muslim, to obtain custody of her children through a Bahraini court decision. Regardless of their parents’ marital status, minor children of a Bahraini father may not leave Bahrain without their father’s permission.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Bahrain.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Bahrain by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Bahrain to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.
