## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are strict. Convicted offenders can expect lengthy jail sentences and heavy fines.

### Smoking

It is against the law to smoke outside in Turkmenistan, except in designated smoking areas.

### Prostitution

Prostitution is illegal.

Authorities will generally consider any Turkmen woman leaving a club with a foreign man late at night to be a prostitute. On that basis, the foreigner may be detained.

### Lèse-majesté

Avoid publicly discussing politics or criticizing the country’s current and previous leaders.

### Photography

Photography of military installations, police stations, airports, government buildings and other sensitive sites may result in a penalty.

Seek permission from local authorities before taking photographs.

### Communications

Satellite phones and other forms of communication are illegal. 

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

The laws of Turkmenistan prohibit sexual acts between individuals of the same sex.

2SLGBTQI+ persons should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Turkmenistan.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Turkmenistan.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of Turkmenistan, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

Canadians with Turkmen citizenship may be subject to national obligations, such as taxes. Check your status with the Embassy of the Republic of Turkmenistan in Washington, D.C., prior to departure.

Dual Turkmen–Canadian citizens are likely to have a difficult time returning to Canada after visiting Turkmenistan, and it might be necessary for them to renounce Turkmen citizenship in order to be allowed to depart. The renunciation process can take six months or longer.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Turkmenistan.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Turkmenistan, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Turkmen court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Turkmenistan to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Ramadan

In 2026, the lunar month of Ramadan is expected to begin on or around February 17.

In public, between sunrise and sunset, be discreet when:

* drinking
* eating
* smoking

### Exports

Cultural objects, such as woven carpets and artefacts, must be authenticated by the Ministry of Culture prior to departure.

Failure to do so will result in confiscation and/or a fine that may be greater than the value of the item in question.

### Driving

Drinking and driving is strictly forbidden. Drivers may be fined or jailed if any amount of alcohol is detected.

You should carry an international driving permit.

Foreigners residing in Turkmenistan must apply for a local driver’s licence with the Road Police Department.

### Money

The currency is the new Turkmenistan manat (TMT).

The economy is primarily cash-based. A few hotels and restaurants in Ashgabat accept credit cards (specifically American Express and Visa) and traveller’s cheques in U.S. dollars. U.S. currency and euros can be exchanged into the local currency at banks and exchange bureaus. Since there are few international ATMs in the country, you may find it difficult to obtain cash.

You must declare all foreign currency you bring into the country.
