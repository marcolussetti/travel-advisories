## Natural disasters and climate

Armeniaâ€™s climate is continental, and temperatures vary geographically. In Yerevan, summers are hot and winters are mild.

A vast portion of the territory is at an altitude of 1000m above sea level where temperatures are lower than in the capital and rainfall more frequent.

### Earthquakes

Armenia is located in an active seismic zone. Although no major events have occurred in recent years, an earthquake could strike at any time.

### Flood

The rainy season generally extends from March to June and from October to November.

Seasonal flooding can affect overland travel and the provision of essential services, especially in the Ararat and Shirak valleys. Landslides could occur, roads may become impassable and bridges damaged.

* Monitor local media for updates, including road conditions
* Stay away from flooded areas
* Monitor weather reports
* Follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders
