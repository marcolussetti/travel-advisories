# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Border areas

The Government of Canada’s ability to provide consular services in areas along the international borders with Azerbaijan is extremely limited.

#### Azerbaijan

The security environment remains highly volatile at the eastern border between Armenia and Azerbaijan.

There have been periodic outbreaks of violence in these areas for several decades and, while there have been no major incidents since Azerbaijan’s military operations in September 2023, tensions remain heightened. As part of the ongoing tensions between Azerbaijan and Armenia, there are also occasional ceasefire violations and clashes on the Nakhchivan border.

All border crossings into Azerbaijan are closed and the border is heavily militarized.

Armed clashes occur occasionally at multiple points along the international border, including near the following Armenian cities:

* Sotk
* Tegh
* Goris
* Jermuk
* Kapan

Border areas with Azerbaijan are subject to extremely dangerous military activities, such as:

* mortar and artillery shelling
* rocket fire
* drone attacks
* heavy gunfire
* landmines

If you choose to travel near the border with Azerbaijan despite this advisory:

* exercise caution at all times
* avoid travelling at night
* monitor local and international media to stay informed on current clashes
* follow instructions from local authorities and security forces

#### Türkiye

The land border between Türkiye and Armenia is closed.

#### Iran

The border crossing near the Armenian town of Meghri is the only official access to Iran from Armenia.

Russian border guards are present along the border and have set up several checkpoints to deter smuggling and other illegal activities into Armenia from Iran.

Iran’s military occasionally conducts operations in the area.

* Only cross at official border crossings
* Follow the instructions of security forces
* Avoid travelling at night
* Avoid travelling alone

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Pickpocketing, mugging, purse snatching and theft from cars and homes occur.

During your stay:

* keep your car and home doors locked and windows closed at all times
* don’t leave personal items and documents in plain sight in a vehicle
* make sure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents are secure at all times
* don’t show signs of affluence

Police officers don’t regularly patrol streets and response may take longer than expected.

### Terrorism

There is a low threat of terrorism in Armenia, but attacks could occur at any time.

In 2022, there have been bomb alerts in Yerevan targeting:

* Zvartnots International Airport
* metro stations
* shopping malls
* the city hall
* the national assembly

Targets could also include:

* schools
* places of worship
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

In the event of a bomb alert:

* expect heightened presence of security forces and disruptions to air traffic and public transportation
* monitor local media to stay informed on the evolving situation
* follow instructions of local authorities and security forces, including evacuation orders
* don’t go near the targeted areas

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places. Be particularly vigilant if attending:

* sporting events
* religious holidays
* other public celebrations

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations take place regularly, particularly in Yerevan and the vicinity of institutional buildings, and are mostly peaceful.

In 2022, large-scale demonstrations took place in several cities across Armenia over the government’s posture toward Azerbaijan after the Nagorno-Karabakh war. They have led to acts of vandalism and violent clashes amongst demonstrators and with security forces in certain places.

Further demonstrations are likely.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Road safety

#### Road conditions

Road conditions have improved in recent years in Yerevan and on main roads. Roads in rural areas are poorly maintained and dangerous due to:

* insufficient lighting
* bad road markings and signage
* large potholes
* unpaved sections
* lack of road shoulders
* poor snow clearing during winter

Emergency services may take a long time to reach you if you’re involved in an accident outside of urban areas. You must have a warning triangle in your car at all times in case of an emergency.

#### Driving habits

Drivers are often distracted, frequently break traffic regulations, drive at excessive speeds and lack driving skills.

Pedestrians often cross in the middle of the road and drivers don’t always give pedestrians the right of way.

Driving under the influence of alcohol is common, especially on weekends.

U-turns and lane changes without warning occur frequently.

If you’re driving in Armenia:

* always drive defensively
* avoid driving at night
* use main roads and highways as much as possible
* don’t stop in isolated areas
* always carry a cellphone and a charger

### Women’s safety

Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse.

### Fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud occurs.

Be careful when using debit or credit cards:

* pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others
* use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN

#### Tourist scams

There have been reports of foreigners being pickpocketed or forced to pay the bill by friendly strangers who:

* offer to help, especially near ATMs
* ask you to take a photo
* invite you for drinks at a bar

While travelling:

* avoid showing signs of affluence, carrying large sums of cash or unnecessary valuables
* pay attention to your surroundings, particularly in crowded and tourist areas
* be extra cautious when withdrawing cash from ATMs

### Adventure tourism

Adventure tourism, such as zip-lining, kayaking, rock climbing or trekking, can be dangerous, especially if they are not well-organized. Trails are not always marked and weather conditions can change rapidly.

Tour operators may not meet international standards.

If you are participating in adventure tourism:

* never do so alone, and do not part with your tour companions  consider hiring an experienced guide from a reputable company
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to tackle the challenges of your activity
* avoid venturing off marked trails
* refrain from using equipment if you have doubts on their safety
* always wear a lifejacket during water activities.

### Public transportation

#### Taxi

Taxis are widely available in Yerevan, but vehicles are often in poor condition and don't always have standard security features like seatbelts.

Most taxi drivers:

* smoke and talk on the phone while driving
* don’t accept credit cards
* can’t make change for large bills

There are several mobile applications on which you can order taxis with safer vehicles and fixed fares.

If you choose to take a taxi:

* confirm the driver's identity and license plate before getting into the car
* never share a cab with strangers
* make sure the driver does not pick up other passengers on the way to your destination
* negotiate the fare in advance
* have small bills available for payment.

#### Train

Trains operate in Armenia, but mainly serve destinations in the north of the country. Be careful when travelling by train as wagons are often overcrowded and not always well-maintained.

* Make sure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Don’t leave the compartment unattended
* Keep the door locked from the inside

#### Buses

When travelling outside of Yerevan, avoid using minibuses called "Marshrutka".

Drivers are reckless and are often involved in accidents. The vehicles are overcrowded and not always equipped with seatbelts.

Petty crimes such as theft occur, and drivers may overcharge you.
