## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Transfer to a Canadian prison

Canada and Armenia are signatories to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in Armenia to request a transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both Canadian and Armenia authorities.

This process can take a long time, and there is no guarantee that the transfer will be approved by either or both sides.

You could face:

### National obligations

Canadian-Armenian citizens may also be subject to national obligations, such as taxes and military service. Check your status with the Embassy of the Republic of Armenia in Canada. Authorities may detain dual nationals who try to avoid military service and face large fines or imprisonment.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Armenia.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Armenia by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Armenia to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.
