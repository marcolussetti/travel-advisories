### Monsoon

The rainy season, or monsoon, extends from June to September. Landslides occur frequently. Mountain roads can be hazardous, even in good weather.

Seasonal flooding can make overland travel difficult and reduce the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable and bridges can be damaged.
