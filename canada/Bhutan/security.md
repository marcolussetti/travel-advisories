# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing, theft and purse snatching, occurs on occasion, particularly in the capital Thimphu.

Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport, are secure at all times.

Violent crime is not common.

### Trekking

Bhutan is located in the eastern Himalayas. Several trekking trails are situated at altitudes exceeding 5,000 metres. High-altitude illnesses may occur at high altitudes.

If you intend on trekking:

* know the symptoms of high-altitude illnesses, which can be fatal
* never do so alone and always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* ensure that you are properly equipped and well informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary, including when you expect to be back to camp
* obtain detailed information on trekking routes before setting out and do not venture off marked trails or slopes

### Tourism

You must buy a travel package from an authorized travel agent in advance. Travel agents and tour operators will arrange your visit and apply for your visa. A daily rate covers most services in the package, including accommodation, meals, internal transportation except flights, guides and cultural programs. You must travel in groups with authorized drivers when visiting Bhutan.

Tourist facilities are very limited.

You may find it difficult to travel in Bhutan if you have physical disabilities.

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety can vary greatly throughout the country. The road network is extremely limited.

The main highway, referred to as the Lateral Road, is paved and connects the east and west, linking main cities. It runs from Phuentsholing on the border with India in the southwest to Trashigang in the east. Construction is currently underway on the eastern portion of the Lateral Road. Expect closures along this section of the highway.

In the mountains, sharp curves, limited visibility and narrow roads create dangerous road conditions, particularly in the winter and during the rainy season.

Because of driving and road conditions, traffic moves slowly. You may need several hours to reach your destination.

Plan your travel accordingly.

### Public transportation

Public transportation in Bhutan is limited. It’s preferable to travel with the transportation arranged by your tour operator.

#### Taxis

Taxis are available in the major cities. They are unreliable and poorly maintained. Drivers tend to hike up the fares as they are unregulated and often not metered.

Negotiate your fare with the driver at the start of the trip.

### Stray dogs

Stray dogs can be loud and disruptive at night and can carry rabies. Always be cautious around wandering dogs. If you are bit, head to the nearest hospital to receive an anti-rabies treatment.

### Air travel

We don't make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.
