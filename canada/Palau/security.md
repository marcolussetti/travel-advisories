### Water activities

#### Swimming

Beaches are not usually supervised by lifeguards. Tidal changes can cause powerful currents in the coastal lagoons that surround the islands. Riptides are common. Several drownings occur each year.

Rescue services may not be consistent with international standards.

* Consult local residents and tour operators for information on possible hazards and safe swimming areas
* Follow the instructions and warnings of local authorities

#### Diving

Tour operators may not adhere to international standards.

If you undertake adventure sports, such as diving:

* choose a well-established and reputable company that has insurance
* ensure that your travel insurance covers the recreational activities you choose.

In doubt concerning the safety of the installation or equipment, don’t use them.
