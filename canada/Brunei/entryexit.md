# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Bruneian authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond the date you expect to leave Brunei.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Other entry requirements

#### Health insurance

When entering Brunei, you must be able to show sufficient proof of medical insurance to customs officials, which must cover the entire length of your stay. If you do not have proof of insurance coverage, your visa will only be valid for two weeks.

#### E-Arrival Card

You must register and get approved for an E-Arrival Card before arriving in Brunei by air, land or sea. If you arrived in Brunei before February 9, 2023, and didn't get an E-Arrival Card, you will need to get one before leaving Brunei. The E-Arrival Card is separate from any visa requirements.

You are exempt from this requirement if you are transiting through Brunei.

#### Arrival Declaration Form

To enter Brunei, you must fill out the Arrival Declaration Form through the BruHealth application up to 72 hours before arrival. The BruHealth app can be downloaded from the Google Playstore and Apple App Store.

#### Health screening

You will not be allowed entry into Brunei if you have HIV/AIDS or any other communicable disease. You will be asked to complete a health declaration form upon entry.
