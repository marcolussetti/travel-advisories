## Safety and security

### Crime

Violent crime is rare.

Petty crime, such as break-ins and theft, occurs. Crime increases in July when school is out of session, and during the December holidays.

Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times. Do not leave possessions in unattended vehicles.

### Trekking

If you intend on trekking in the rainforest:

* use recognized and well-known guides
* stay on the footpaths
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* ensure that you’re properly equipped and well informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* inform a family member or friend of your trekking area, including when you expect to return from your activity
* obtain detailed information on trekking routes before setting out and do not venture off marked paths

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety are good throughout the country.

Speeding, running red lights and distracted driving are common traffic infractions. In case of an accident, remain at the scene and do not move your vehicle until police arrive.

You can get a self-drive rental or chauffeur-driven car from major hotels and the airport. You should make arrangements for this before you arrive.

### Public transportation

#### Buses

Buses operate between 6 a.m. and 8 p.m. but are infrequent.

#### Taxis

You can usually get a metered taxi at hotels, shopping centres and the airport. Your hotel can arrange for a taxi or provide a taxi driver’s cell-phone number. Some drivers will negotiate a fare.

Water taxis are the most common form of transport to and from Kampong Ayer. Fares are negotiable.
