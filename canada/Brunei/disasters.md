## Natural disasters and climate

### Earthquakes

Brunei is located in an active seismic zone. However, earthquakes and volcano activity are not common.

### Rainy/monsoon seasons

The rainy (or monsoon) seasons occur from September to January and from May to July. During these periods, even small storms can quickly develop into major ones. These severe rainstorms can put you at risk and hamper the provision of essential services. They may also cause flooding and landslides.

If you decide to travel to Brunei during the monsoon seasons:

* know that you expose yourself to serious safety risks
* be prepared to change your travel plans on short notice, including cutting short or cancelling your trip
* stay informed of the latest regional weather forecasts
* carry emergency contact information for your airline or tour operator
* follow the advice and instructions of local authorities

### Pollution

Unrestricted burning in neighbouring Indonesia periodically causes atmospheric pollution to rise to unhealthy levels. Pollutant standard index levels (PSI reading) change quickly and you should closely monitor them by consulting local news and weather reports.
