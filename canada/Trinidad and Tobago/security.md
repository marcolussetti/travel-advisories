Coastal waters can be dangerous.

### Adventure tourism

Outdoor activities can be dangerous.

Tour operators may not meet Canadian safety standards.

If you intend to participate in adventure tourism activities:

* share your itinerary with a friend or family member
* stay on marked trails and consider hiring an experienced guide from a reputable company
* obtain detailed information on your activity and the environment in which you will be setting out
* buy travel insurance that covers incidents related to these types of recreational activities
* monitor weather conditions and other possible hazards
* ensure that you have proper equipment and bring sufficient water

### Water shortages

Water shortages occur regularly in Trinidad and Tobago. They are more frequent during the dry season, from January to May, and can occur for extended periods of time.

* Keep a sufficient supply of water on hand
* Monitor local media for the latest information

### Roads

#### Road safety

Major roadways are generally reliable. However, robberies and carjackings along the East-West Corridor to and from Piarco Airport and Port of Spain continue to be reported despite an increased police presence.

If travelling along this route:

* exercise extreme caution
* do not leave valuables within reach or in plain sight
* avoid stopping for minor mechanical issues, including flat tires

#### Road conditions

Road conditions are good on highways on both islands.

Rural roads are generally narrow, poorly maintained and congested.

At night, many roads are unlit and shoulders are unmarked.

When driving after dark:

* familiarize yourself with your itinerary before you leave
* be extra cautious

#### Driving habits

Drivers may not necessarily respect traffic laws and are known to stop abruptly. Drinking and driving is a concern, especially during festivities.

### Public transportation

Private taxis and mini-buses called maxi-taxis are shared transportation and cash-based. Drivers stop frequently along their routes to pick up and drop off passengers. They should be avoided.

Ride-sharing apps are not always reliable. You should plan for an alternative transportation method.

You should reserve transportation services through official taxi companies such as those associated with major hotels or the airport. Confirm the fare in advance.

### Piracy

Pirates commit attacks, kidnappings and armed robberies against ships in coastal waters. Travellers should take appropriate precautions.
