## Natural disasters and climate

### Climate change

Climate change is affecting Trinidad and Tobago. Extreme and unusual weather events are becoming more frequent and may affect your travel plans. Monitor local media for the latest information.

### Hurricane season

Hurricanes usually occur from mid-May to the end of November. During this period, even small tropical storms can quickly develop into major hurricanes.

These severe storms can put you at risk and hamper the provision of essential services. You could face serious safety risks during a hurricane.

While hurricanes rarely hit Trinidad and Tobago directly, tropical storms, and hurricanes passing to the north of the country, can cause heavy rains leading to severe flooding and landslides.

If you decide to travel to a coastal area during the hurricane season:

* be prepared to change your travel plans on short notice, including cutting short or cancelling your trip
* stay informed of the latest regional weather forecasts
* carry emergency contact information for your airline or tour operator
* follow the advice and instructions of local authorities
