## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Transfer to a Canadian prison

Canada and Trinidad and Tobago are signatories to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in Trinidad and Tobago to request a transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both Canadian and Trinidadian and Tobagonian authorities.

This process can take a long time, and there is no guarantee that the transfer will be approved by either or both sides.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect jail sentences and heavy fines.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

2SLGBTQI+ persons have been harassed and verbally and/or physically abused. Be cautious and avoid public displays of affection with someone of the same sex.

The law in Trinidad and Tobago prohibits sexual acts between men. Those convicted can face sentences of up to 5 years in prison.

It’s illegal for 2SLGBTQI+ foreign nationals to enter the country, but this law is rarely enforced.

### Dual citizenship

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Trinidad and Tobago, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Trinidad and Tobago.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Trinidad and Tobago, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Trinidadian and Tobagonian court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Trinidad and Tobago to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

All children below the age of 5 must be buckled into a car seat or a booster seat in the back seat of a vehicle.
