## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

A serious violation may lead to a jail or death sentence. The sentence will be served in local prisons.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Belarus.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of Belarus, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Belarus.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Belarus, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Belarusian court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Belarus to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Identification

Always carry originals of your passport, visa and migration card, as you may be asked to prove your identity and date of entry into the country. Failure to provide internationally recognized identification could result in detention.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect lengthy jail sentences.

### Photography

Photography of military installations, public buildings and monuments may result in a penalty. Seek permission from local authorities before taking photographs.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Belarusian law does not prohibit sexual acts between individuals of the same sex. Homosexuality, however, is not widely accepted in Belarus.

### Driving

You must carry an international driving permit.

Checkpoints are common on roads and border crossings in Belarus.

Traffic safety in Belarus is controlled by uniformed police officers known as DAI in Belarusian and GAI in Russian. If a traffic police officer waves a striped wand or points a red retro-reflector at you, you must pull over and stop, and be ready to present driving and insurance documents.

Drivers of foreign vehicles must pay a fee to use Belarusian highways.

There is a [digital road toll system](http://www.belarus.by/rel_image/4581), BelToll, to collect tolls along motorways.

You must drive with the vehicle lights on at all times from November 1 to March 31.

The use of hand-held devices while driving is prohibited.

Drivers may not have any alcohol in their blood system: the alcohol limit for drivers is 0.00%.

The speed limit in urban areas is 60 km/h, unless specified otherwise. Outside urban areas the speed limit is 90 km/h and on highways, 110 km/h. Speed limits are strictly enforced.

Most traffic signs are in Cyrillic script only (not Latin).

The Belarusian government may enforce a requirement for special permits to travel in “protected border zones.” Be alert for warning signs, road barriers or border-guard posts. Do not cross into such areas without permission. For more information, contact the embassy of Belarus.

at a bank for rubles.

You must pay for goods and services in Belarusian rubles. The use of foreign currency in cash transactions is prohibited. You can face arrest if you attempt to buy an item with currency other than Belarusian rubles. Exchange foreign currency at government-licensed booths only. A valid passport must be presented to purchase foreign currency.
