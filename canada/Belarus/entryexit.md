# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Belarusian authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you use for travel.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 3 months beyond the date you expect to leave from Belarus.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Visas

Tourist visa: not required for stays of up to 30 days  
Private visa: not required for stays of up to 30 days  
Business visa: not required for stays of up to 30 days  
Student visa: required

You can enter Belarus without a visa for a period of up to 30 days, which cannot be extended, at the following conditions:

* You must arrive at Minsk National Airport
* You must  have a regular passport valid for at least 90 days beyond the date you expect to leave Belarus
* You must  show a proof of sufficient funds to cover your stay in Belarus (Br 49,000 (approx. CAD$30) for each day of stay)
* You must  have a medical insurance coverage of at least €10,000

Those conditions don’t apply if you are flying in from or to Russia as these flights are considered internal flights with no border control.

There are reports of foreigners being denied entry into Belarus. Even if you meet entry requirements, local authorities may deny you entry to Belarus if they consider your travel as non-essential.

Before you travel:

* confirm the entry and exit requirements with the regional migration office
* confirm the status of the border checkpoints
* monitor local media for the latest information

### Land border crossings

Local authorities in Poland and Lithuania have shut down certain border crossings with Belarus due to security concerns. Polish, Lithuanian and Latvian authorities may close additional border crossings with little or no warning.

### Entering Belarus by car

When entering Belarus by private vehicle, you must fill out a customs card and show proof of ownership documents or a power of attorney letter at the border crossing.

These documents must be translated into Belarusian and certified at a Belarusian embassy. Third-party car insurance is mandatory and can only be purchased upon entry into Belarus.

### Registration

If staying in Belarus for more than 10 business days, you must register with the Citizenship and Migration Department of the Ministry of Interior (formerly OVIR) office in the district in which you are staying. Registration must be done no later than 3 working days after arriving in Belarus.

Registration will normally be arranged by your hotel. If you are not staying in a hotel, registration must be organized by your host.

Failure to register can result in fines and difficulties when departing.

### Health insurance

You must present proof of valid medical insurance translated into Belarussian or Russian to enter Belarus. In addition, you will be required to purchase mandatory state insurance at the port of entry.
