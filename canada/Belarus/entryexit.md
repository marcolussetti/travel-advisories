# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Belarusian authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Heightened scrutiny

You may face added scrutiny at the border or be denied entry to Belarus with no reason provided. Even if you meet entry requirements, local authorities may deny you entry to Belarus if they consider your travel to be non-essential.

Before you travel:

* confirm the entry and exit requirements with the regional migration office
* confirm the status of the border checkpoints
* monitor local media for the latest information

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 90 days beyond the date you expect to leave from Belarus.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Visa-free entry

You can enter Belarus without a visa for a period of up to 30 days if you enter the country by flying into certain airports, including Minsk National Airport. This visa-free period cannot be extended. You must also meet the following conditions:

* You must have a regular passport valid for at least 90 days beyond the date you expect to leave Belarus
* You must show a proof of sufficient funds to cover your stay in Belarus (Br 49,000 (approx. CAD$30) for each day of stay)
* You must  have a medical insurance coverage of at least €10,000

Those conditions don’t apply if you are flying in from or to Russia as these flights are considered internal flights with no border control.

### Land border crossings

Local authorities in Poland, Latvia and Lithuania have shut down certain border crossings with Belarus and may close additional border crossings with little or no warning. If you intend to travel to Poland from Belarus, you must apply for a humanitarian reasons permit.

If you plan to cross from Belarus into Poland, Lithuania or Latvia, only the following border crossings remain open to cars and buses:

* Poland:

+ Brest/Terespol

* Lithuania:

+ Medininkai/Kamienny
+ Šalčininkai /Beniakoni

* Latvia:

+ Paternieki/Grigorovshchina

Other entry requirements and EU sanctions may apply at the border with these countries. You should consider travelling by bus instead of in a personal vehicle to avoid certain restrictions.

### Entering Belarus by car

If you enter Belarus with a private vehicle, you must fill out a customs card and show proof of ownership documents or a power of attorney letter at the border crossing.

These documents must be translated into Belarusian and certified at a Belarusian embassy. You must also have third-party car insurance that can only be purchased in Belarus.

### Registration

If you’re staying in Belarus for more than 10 business days, you must register with the Citizenship and Migration Department of the Ministry of Interior (formerly OVIR) office in the district in which you are staying. You must register within three working days after arriving in Belarus.

Your hotel usually arranges your registration on your behalf. If you are not staying in a hotel, contact your host to ensure that they register your stay.

You could be fined or face difficulty at the border when you leave if you are not registered.

### Health insurance

You must present proof of valid medical insurance translated into Belarussian or Russian to enter Belarus. In addition, you will be required to purchase mandatory state insurance at the port of entry.
