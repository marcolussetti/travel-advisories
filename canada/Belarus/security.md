## Safety and security

### Impacts of the armed conflict in Ukraine

In February 2022, Russia launched a military invasion of Ukraine. Russian forces conduct military operations from Belarus. Security conditions are unpredictable and could deteriorate without notice.

Projectiles from the armed conflict in Ukraine have landed in the Brest region near the Ukrainian border. Be aware of your surroundings.

The ability of the Embassy of Canada to Poland to provide consular services in Belarus is extremely limited. If you are in Belarus, you should leave by commercial means.

If you decide to remain in Belarus despite this advisory, be aware that:

* you may have to stay in Belarus longer than expected
* you may not be able to access your funds in Canadian or most international financial institutions
* you should not depend on the Government of Canada to help you leave the country

If you plan to leave Belarus:

* ensure that your [travel documents](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadian-passports.html) and those of your family are up-to-date and secure at all times

* communicate your travel plans to family and friends
* register and update your contact information through the [Registration of Canadians Abroad](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/registration) service and encourage other Canadian citizens in Belarus to do so

### Political situation

Belarusian authorities may enforce local laws in an arbitrary manner. The Belarusian government and security forces actively target political opposition, journalists, and individuals perceived to be critical of the government. This includes activities that have taken place in the past or outside of Belarus.

Journalists face considerable risks. Local and foreign journalists could face intimidation, harassment and violence. Some have been detained or had their equipment confiscated. The political situation remains fluid and unpredictable. Authorities could enforce security restrictions without notice.

If you are in Belarus:

* expect a heightened security presence and security checks

* avoid expressions of dissent or making statements critical of or sensitive to the government
* monitor local media for the latest information

### Surveillance

You could experience surveillance by the authorities simply because you are a foreigner. They may:

* monitor your telecommunications and your location at all times
* review the content stored on your electronic devices
* search your personal possessions or accommodations without your knowledge or consent
* subject you to intense scrutiny at the airport or border crossings, including searches of your personal possessions and telecommunications devices.

Local authorities in Belarus block access to several:

* websites
* social networks
* search engines
* online services

Don’t assume that your internet connection or past internet activity is private. Foreigners have been expelled from the country for working with Belarusian civil-society groups.

### Crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs, particularly in particularly in crowded public areas and places frequented by foreigners, such as:

* popular tourist areas, including lookouts
* buses, trains, bus and train stations, and airports
* hotel lobbies
* restaurants, including outdoor seating areas
* beaches

During your trip:

* keep your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, in a secure place and out of sight
* do not show signs of affluence or wear expensive jewellery
* avoid deserted streets at night
* avoid isolated areas

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in Europe. Terrorist attacks have occurred in several European cities. There is a potential for other violent incidents.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including police stations
* schools, including universities
* places of worship
* airports and transportation hubs
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners
* cultural venues

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

Be particularly vigilant during:

* sporting events
* religious holidays
* public celebrations
* major political events, such as elections

Terrorists may use such occasions to mount attacks.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations can occur. Local authorities have used force and arrested demonstrators in the past. If you are close to a demonstration, you may be detained by the Belarusian authorities for questioning. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Fraud

#### Credit card, debit card and ATM fraud

Credit and debit card as well as ATM fraud occurs.

When using your debit or credit card:

* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* pay careful attention when others are handling your cards
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* use ATMs located in public areas or inside a bank or business
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

### Spiked food, drinks and other items.

Never leave your food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Avoid accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as these items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

2SLGBTQI+ persons, as well as their allies, have been harassed, and verbally and physically abused.

Belarusian law does not prohibit sexual acts between individuals of the same sex. Homosexuality, however, is not widely accepted in Belarus.

Media and artistic depictions of same-sex relationships and transgender people are considered “pornography” under Belarusian law. You could face arrest and detention for public displays of 2SLGBTQI+ relationships, themes, or identities.

2SLGBTQI+ travellers should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Belarus.

### Roads

#### Road conditions

Road conditions vary considerably across the country. Many roads are impassable in winter. In rural areas, horse-drawn carts are a common road hazard.

 Roads may be poorly maintained and dangerous due to:

* large potholes
* malfunctioning or absence of traffic lights
* insufficient lighting
* uneven surfaces
* bad road markings and signage

#### Driving habits

Drivers don’t always respect traffic laws. Speeding is common, and drivers can be aggressive and reckless.

### Public transportation

#### Taxis

Only use officially marked taxis from reputable taxi companies. Never share a taxi with strangers.

Arrange your pickup with your hotel before arrival when travelling by air.

#### Trains

Thieves are active on trains. Store valuables in a safe place and do not leave your compartment unattended. Lock the door from the inside.

### Air travel

We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.
