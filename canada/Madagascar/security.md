# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Political situation in Madagascar

On October 14, 2025, following large-scale demonstrations, the military took over and announced a 2-year transition period followed by new elections.

The situation remains volatile and violent demonstrations can occur at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

Antananarivo-Ivato International Airport remains open, but you should confirm your flight status before heading to the airport.

Curfews remain in place in Antananarivo and in most major cities. Further curfews and restrictions on movement could be imposed without notice.

If you are in Madagascar:

* contact your airline before going to the airport to confirm your travel plans, and only proceed if it is safe to do so
* stay away from demonstrations
* expect heavy security measures and increased security presence
* monitor local media for the latest information
* follow the instructions of local authorities, including curfew orders

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, is common throughout the country. Be particularly vigilant in areas frequented by tourists in Antananarivo, specifically:

* the steps leading to the Rova
* the Avenue de l’Indépendance
* the Analakely market
* the road leading to the Soarano train station
* 67 Hectares
* Itaosy
* Antaninarenina
* Tsaralalana

During your stay:

* be aware of your surroundings at all times

* avoid showing signs of affluence or wearing expensive jewelry
* do not leave valuables or bags unattended
* avoid carrying large sums of cash
* only use a reputable tour operator
* avoid walking after dark

#### Violent crime

There are reports of violent crime across all regions of Madagascar. Armed gangs are known to commit home invasions, carjackings, robberies, and kidnappings. Foreigners have been targeted in urban areas as well as in rural and isolated areas. Theft from vehicles occurs frequently. Thieves target cars stuck in traffic for smash-and-grab robberies.

During your stay:

* do not travel after dark
* choose a well secured accommodation
* make sure you lock doors and windows at night and when you’re away
* always lock your car doors and windows
* keep valuables out of sight and reach
* avoid confrontation
* if attacked, don’t resist

#### Assaults

There have been reports of attacks and robberies by persons representing themselves as “guides”, particularly on beaches and in coastal tourist areas.

Violent assaults have been reported in:

* the island of Sainte Marie (also known as Nosy Boraha)
* Ihosy
* Pic Saint Louis in Tôlanaro (formerly Fort Dauphin)
* Toliara, especially in Batterie Beach
* Nosy Be
* Ankify port
* Ambanja
* Anosy region
* Isalo

Avoid visiting these areas alone and seek local advice on the security situation prior to visiting

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations are frequent in Madagascar. Violent clashes between demonstrators and police have occurred. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. There is an increased risk of civil unrest during election periods. Demonstrations can also lead to significant disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### National parks and beaches

Armed gangs are known to assault tourists in isolated areas, such as beaches and national parks.

* Be extremely vigilant when visiting such areas
* Do not visit parks and beaches alone
* Seek advice from your tour operator
* Only enlist the services of a national guide accredited by the Ministry of Tourism
* Ask to see the accredited guide’s badge

Coastal waters can be dangerous. Riptides are common. Several drownings occur each year.

Sharks are present, particularly in the Tamatave and Manakara areas.

### Road safety

Road safety is a major security risk in Madagascar. Fatal accidents are common, and they often involve pedestrians. Police assistance and emergency rescue services are limited in rural areas.

#### Road conditions

Road conditions vary thorough the country and are often in poor condition, especially in rural areas.

Driving can be dangerous due to:

* poorly maintained road and potholes
* stray livestock
* lack of signage
* pedestrian walking on main roads
* insufficient or non-existent lighting and vehicles not using their headlights
* poorly maintained vehicles

Driving conditions, especially in the northern provinces, may be hazardous during the rainy season from November to April.

If you choose to drive in Madagascar:

* avoid driving after dark
* only undertake land travel outside major cities in a four-wheel-drive vehicle
* rent a car with a hired driver as overland travel can be hazardous
* during rainy season, confirm with local authorities that the chosen route is passable

#### Driving habits

Drivers do not always respect traffic laws. They often drive at excessive speeds and have little consideration for pedestrians and other drivers’ right of way. Drinking and driving may occur at any time of the day or night.Traffic accidents can quickly draw large and sometimes violent crowds. Remain calm if there is a dispute, particularly in a public place. If threatened by a large crowd, seek direct intervention of local police.

#### Ambushes

Armed attacks occur on main highways, especially at night and particularly:

* on Route nationale 13 (RN13)
* between Fianarantsoa and Toliara on Route nationale 7 (RN7)
* bewteen Ihosy and Fort Dauphin on Route nationale 13 (RN13)

For some itineraries, flying can be a safer option.

#### Roadblocks

Local authorities occasionally set up roadblocks throughout the country. These checkpoints are routine and could result in vehicle and/or person searches.

* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Remain calm and courteous
* Carry your passport with you at all times

### Public transportation

Public transport services are limited and not all are safe.

#### Taxis

Official taxis can be used for short distances in Antananarivo but are scarce outside of the capital.

Multi-passenger taxis, known as “taxis brousse”, should be avoided as they are often involved in traffic accidents, pose a risk of robbery and are poorly maintained.

* Avoid hailing taxis on the street
* Use airport and hotel taxis
* Never share a taxi with strangers
* Make sure the driver doesn’t pick up other passengers along the way to your destination
* Note driver’s name and plate number
* Ask the driver to start the meter or negotiate the fare in advance
* Have small bills ready for payment

#### Bus

You should avoid buses, locally known as “taxi be”. They are unsafe, overcrowded and frequently involved in accidents

#### Trains

Rail services are extremely limited, slow, often overcrowded and unreliable.

#### Marine transportation

Armed robberies occurred against tourist boats on the Tsiribihina River. You should avoid this area and seek alternative routes.

Ferry accidents occurred due to poor maintenance, overcrowding, lack of security equipment and measures.

If you choose to travel by ferry:

* make sure the vessel you are boarding is carrying appropriate safety equipment and that life jackets are provided for all passengers and accessible at all times
* don’t board vessels that appear overloaded or unseaworthy
* verify the safety standards of ferries with your tour operator
* avoid using water transportation during bad weather conditions

### Piracy

Pirate attacks and armed robbery against ships occur in coastal waters. Mariners should take appropriate precautions.
