## Safety and security

### Crime

#### Petty crime

The crime rate is low. Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs, particularly during the tourist season from May to September.

Thieves are particularly active on public transportation and other crowded public areas.

While you’re in Montenegro:

* ensure that your belongings, including your passport, are secure at all times
* don’t keep your passport and other types of ID in the same place and carry a photocopy rather than the original
* avoid showing signs of affluence or wearing expensive jewellery
* avoid carrying large sums of cash or unnecessary valuables
* avoid deserted streets at night
* pay attention to your surroundings, particularly in crowded and tourist areas and when withdrawing cash from ATM

#### Vehicles

Car theft and break-ins may occur. Rental and luxury vehicles are a target of choice.

* Familiarize yourself with your route before starting a trip
* Keep your windows and doors locked at all times
* Keep your belongings out of reach
* Use secure parking facilities, especially overnight
* Never leave your belongings unattended in a vehicle, even in the trunk

#### Violent crime

Organized crime-related violence occurs.

While violent incidents don’t typically involve foreigners or tourists, there’s a risk of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

Always be vigilant and aware of your surroundings, particularly in border areas.

### Fraud

#### Credit card and ATM fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud occurs. When using debit or credit cards:

* pay careful attention if other people are handling your cards
* use ATMs located in public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

#### Cybercrime

Cybercrime occurs in Montenegro. Perpetrators may compromise public Wi-Fi networks to steal credit card or personal information.

* Avoid using public Wi-Fi networks
* Avoid making purchases on unsecured websites
* Use judgment when posting information on social media
* Be especially careful if you are meeting people you have met online
* Never click a suspicious link in an email or text message asking for your credit card details

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in Europe. Terrorist attacks have occurred in a number of European cities. Terrorist attacks could occur at any time.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places. Be particularly vigilant during:

* sporting events
* religious holidays
* public celebrations
* major political events, such as elections

Terrorists may use such occasions to mount attacks.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations take place from time to time, especially in the vicinity of official buildings.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Soccer matches and sports events

Sports events sometimes lead to rowdy behaviour and violent incidents.

Be vigilant if you attend soccer matches and sports rallies.

### Celebratory gunfire

Firing weapons to celebrate is common in Montenegro. It sometimes coincides with fireworks displays and may take place:

* on weddings
* on certain holidays and days of national observance
* following elections
* after soccer matches and sporting events

Injuries and deaths due to stray bullets do occur.

Avoid areas where celebratory fire is taking place.

### Water activities

#### Swimming

Coastal waters can be dangerous.

In the fall and winter months, waves can be unpredictable, breaking further than expected and causing strong undertows.

* Be cautious when walking on the shore
* Avoid visiting beaches or coastal areas during periods of severe weather warnings
* Always take into account warning flags at beaches
* Don’t dive into unknown water, as hidden rocks or shallow depths can cause serious injury or death
* Exercise caution and follow the advice of local authorities

#### Recreational boating

If you are planning to go boating:

* know the navigation rules
* follow safe practices for all water activities such as jet-skiing, water-skiing, diving, swimming or fishing
* don’t overload your boat capacity
* carry a VHF marine radio that will generate your position in case of emergency
* be prepared for emergencies

### Mountain activities

Mountain activities, such as hiking, can be dangerous, especially if they are not well-organized. Trails are not always marked and weather conditions can change rapidly, even in summer.

If you intend to go hiking or climbing:

* never do so alone
* consider hiring an experienced guide from a reputable company
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* ensure that you’re properly equipped
* stay informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary
* obtain detailed information on trekking routes before setting out
* avoid venturing off marked trails

### Road safety

Most roads are poorly maintained and secondary roads are narrow. Heavy snow and icy roads may constitute a hazard during winter.

The Morača Canyon road is particularly dangerous due to poor road conditions and traffic congestion. Heavy traffic on major routes may also cause delays, particularly during the summer tourist season.

Drivers don’t always respect traffic law. They may be reckless.

### Public transportation

Public transportation systems are available in most cities and larger towns.

#### Buses and trains

Buses and trains are not always well-maintained.

A number of companies offer domestic and international bus services.

Train service is also available; however, it is slow and often subject to delays.

#### Ferries

There are ferries connecting Montenegro with Italy. Weather conditions and strong winds may lead to cancellations or delays.

* Pay attention to pre-departure notices from your carrier
* Always reconfirm departure schedule before heading to the port

#### Taxis

Taxis are widely available. There are fixed prices to and from certain destination, such as the airports of Tivat and Podgorica.

* Use only officially marked taxis
* Confirm the fares in advance, or insist that the driver use the meter, as you may be overcharged
