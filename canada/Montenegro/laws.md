## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Transfer to a Canadian prison

Canada and Montenegro are signatories to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in Montenegro to request a transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both Canadian and Montenegro authorities.

This process can take a long time, and there is no guarantee that the transfer will be approved by either or both sides.

### Identification

Authorities may request to see your ID at any time.

* Carry valid identification or a photocopy of it at all times
* Keep a photocopy of your passport in case it’s lost or seized
* Keep a digital copy of your ID and travel documents

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect long prison sentences and heavy fines.

### Photography

There are restrictions on photographing military or police installations, vehicles, and personnel.

* Do not photograph military installations or personnel even if no prohibition signs are visible
* Comply with all requests from local authorities

### Drones

The recreational and commercial flying of drones is strictly regulated.

You must seek the permission from the Civil Aviation Agency to use a drone in Montenegro.

If you don’t comply, you may be fined and your drone confiscated.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Montenegrin law does not criminalize sexual acts or relationships between persons of the same sex.

However, 2SLGBTQI+ persons could be discriminated against or harassed based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or sex characteristics.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Montenegro.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of Montenegro, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Montenegro.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Montenegro, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Montenegrin court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Montenegro to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Driving

You must carry an international driving permit

#### Vehicle insurance and damage

Drivers of vehicles bearing foreign licence plates must also be in possession of vehicle insurance.

If your vehicle is visibly damaged when entering Montenegro, you must obtain a certificate from the authorities at the frontier. You must show this certificate when leaving the country.

#### Mandatory safety features

All vehicles must have:

* high-visibility vests (to be carried in the passenger compartment, not in the trunk) for the driver and any passenger who leaves the vehicle in case of breakdown
* an European car incident report form
* a spare bulb set
* a first aid kit
* a warning triangle
* snow tires and snow chains between November 15 and March 31

#### Drinking and driving

Penalties for drinking and driving are severe. The legal blood alcohol limit is 0.03 percent.

A person visibly under the influence of alcohol may not travel on the front passenger seat.

#### Priority to the right

The “priority to the right” system is in effect in Montenegro.

Drivers must give way to vehicles approaching from the right at intersections, even on secondary roads. This is often a surprise to foreign drivers and results in accidents.

Familiarize yourself with the “priority to the right” system.

### Money

The currency of Montenegro is the euro (EUR).

If you are carrying €10,000 or more, or the equivalent in other currencies or monetary instruments, you must make a declaration to customs when you enter or leave the European Union.

This does not apply if you are travelling within the European Union or in transit to a non-EU country.
