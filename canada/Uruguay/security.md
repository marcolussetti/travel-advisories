## Safety and security

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs. It’s more common in Montevideo and towns on the border with Brazil. However, during the summer (December to March) tourism season, criminals tend to move to tourist destinations such as:

* Punta del Este
* Rocha
* Colonia del Sacramento

Criminals may be on foot or on motorcycle. Those using motorcycles often work in pairs. The driver will approach the target at a traffic light, parking lot, ATM or hotel, while the other thief steals their wallet, purse or cell phone and escapes quickly.

* Ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Carry a photocopy of your passport with you at all times and ensure that the original is stored in a safe location
* Keep bags and valuables out of sight in your vehicle
* Avoid showing signs of affluence
* Carry only small amounts of cash
* Use ATMs located inside a bank or business

#### Montevideo

Be cautious when walking at night in downtown Montevideo, including in well-travelled areas. Petty crime, muggings and armed robbery are more common in:

* 18 de Julio Avenue
* La Ciudad Vieja (the Old City)
* Plaza Independencia
* Puerto de Montevideo (the port area)

Always exercise a high degree of caution in the following critical neighbourhoods:

* 40 Semanas
* Barrio Borro
* Bella Italia
* Casabó
* Casavalle
* Hipódromo
* La Teja
* Malvín Norte
* Marconi
* Tres Ombúes
* Villa del Cerro
* Villa Española

During the summer months, the tourist police patrol the following Montevideo neighbourhoods, where most hotels are located:

* El Centro
* La Ciudad Vieja
* El Cordón and El Parque Rodó
* Pocitos
* Punta Carretas

There is an increased presence of uniformed police officers on foot in areas where tourists are concentrated. Authorities have also increased the number of patrol cars in residential areas.

#### Burglaries

Burglaries occur in both occupied and unoccupied residences, even during the day. Houses are more vulnerable than apartments.

* Keep doors and windows locked
* Don’t open your door to people you don’t know

#### ATMs

* Be particularly cautious when using ATMs
* Use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business

### Women’s safety

Women travelling alone should be cautious, particularly in the critical neighbourhoods of Montevideo mentioned above.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations occur regularly in Montevideo and are generally peaceful.

However, even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Swimming

Coastal waters can be dangerous. Riptides occur.

Some beaches have lifeguards and warning flags during the summer. However, rescue services may not be consistent with international standards.

* Consult residents and tour operators for information on possible hazards and safe swimming areas
* Follow the instructions and warnings of local authorities

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety vary greatly throughout the country.

Accidents causing fatalities are common due to:

* hilly terrain and winding roads
* poor lighting, lane markings and paving
* lack of stop signs and traffic lights at many intersections
* poorly maintained cars

The main toll road to Punta del Este is in good condition and well-marked. However, accidents increase on this and other main highways in the summer, during Carnaval in mid-February and during Easter week.

Drivers often don’t respect traffic laws.

Gas stations may be scarce in rural areas. If you’re driving long distances:

* plan accordingly
* fill up in cities and make sure to have enough fuel to reach your destination

### Public transportation

#### Taxis and ridesharing services

Taxis are equipped with a thick glass partition installed to protect drivers against crime. Injuries may occur as people are thrown against the partition when the driver brakes suddenly or is involved in an accident. Injuries can be severe even in minor collisions.

Several ridesharing services are available. They are monitored to ensure that they meet safety standards equivalent to those applied to taxis.

If you use a trusted ridesharing app, confirm the driver’s identity and the licence plate before getting in the car.

#### Buses

Bus travel in Montevideo and around the country is safe and reliable.
