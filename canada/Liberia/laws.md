### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Liberia.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Liberia by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Liberia to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Driving

You should carry an international driving permit.

The use of a seatbelt is mandatory.

Convoys carrying government officials travel at high speeds, and you must pull over and turn off your headlights if you see one approaching. You should wait a few minutes after the convoy passes before continuing on.

### Money

The currency is the Liberian dollar (LRD).

The economy is cash-based. Many merchants accept U.S. dollars for payment. Visa and MasterCard are accepted at some of the larger hotels.

ATMs are scarcely available and only in Monrovia. You can only use a Visa card to withdraw cash from an ATM. Bring sufficient funds in U.S. dollars to cover expenses.
