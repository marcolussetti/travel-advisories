# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Security situation

The security situation remains volatile and unpredictable.

Political tensions are high following recent leadership changes and clashes between rival factions earlier this year.

Although conditions in Juba appear calm, the situation can deteriorate quickly. Outbreaks of violence remain possible.

Violent clashes between security forces and opposition groups continue in several states and the risk of further escalation cannot be ruled out.

* Avoid demonstrations and large gatherings
* Monitor local and international media to stay informed of the latest developments
* Keep a supply of water, food, medication and other essential supplies
* Keep your communication devices charged and secure backup power sources

There is a heightened military presence in Juba due to ongoing tensions in the north of the country.

Many security checkpoints have been set up throughout the country. Vehicles are regularly stopped and searched, sometimes resulting in violence.

Violent clashes usually increase during the dry season, from December to April.

Urban crime rates and the potential for civil unrest are high due to poor economic conditions.

Inter-tribal clashes occur without warning throughout the country, and there is frequent fighting between the army and armed militia groups.

### Political situation

Political tensions have worsened since the 2018 peace agreement was extended for another two years, pushing the end of the transitional period to February 2027. General elections are scheduled for December 2026.

### Northern states

Fighting between government forces and armed opposition groups has intensified in Upper Nile state, particularly around Nasir County. The situation in Unity state remains tense and sporadic clashes occur.

The ongoing war in Sudan contributes to instability along the border, leading to the displacement of thousands of people into South Sudan.

Security threats remain in the oil-producing regions, particularly around Paloich in Upper Nile state. The military and rebel groups may target infrastructure.

The is frequent fighting in the Abyei region due to a territorial dispute between Sudan and South Sudan, which has led to mass displacements. Intercommunal tensions and cattle rustling frequently lead to violent clashes in South Sudan’s northern states.

### Jonglei state

The situation is extremely volatile in Jonglei state, more specifically in Bor and Pibor due to inter-communal fighting.

Anti-government forces control of much of the countryside, while the government retains control within Bor and the Greater Pibor Administrative Area.

### Southern states

There is increased militia activity in Central Equatoria and some parts of Western Equatoria states, particularly in Mundri.

Travel on the three main roads has become extremely dangerous as armed attacks on these roads are frequent between:

* Juba–Nimule
* Juba–Kajo Keji
* Juba–Yei

The border area between South Sudan and Kenya remains volatile due to clashes between heavily armed youths on both sides of the borders.

There is an increase of attacks by non-state armed groups near the border crossing with Uganda at Nimule, Eastern Equatoria. South Sudanese authorities will close the border crossing for short periods when incidents occur.

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and handbag snatching, occurs regularly and mainly in Juba.

During your stay in South Sudan:

* ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and your other travel documents are secure at all times
* avoid showing signs of affluence or wearing expensive jewellery
* avoid carrying large sums of cash or valuables

#### Violent crime

There is widespread violent crime throughout South Sudan. Incidents include:

* kidnappings
* armed robbery
* carjackings
* compound invasions

The current economic crisis has led to a significant increase in the number of crimes involving guns. The economic crisis will likely deepen in the short to medium term.

There are frequent armed invasions of the compounds housing international non-governmental organizations.

Incidences are especially high in Juba, which has seen regular outbreaks of violence and lawlessness and increasing numbers of carjackings.

Crime usually rises in the run-up to Christmas, New Year and Easter seasons. Foreigners have been victims of many crimes, including rape and robbery.

Law enforcement personnel have limited capacity to deter crime.

### Kidnappings

Several kidnappings have occurred primarily in the oil producing areas of Unity and Upper Nile states.

Kidnappers mainly target workers in the oil and aid sectors working in remote and contested areas.

If you plan to go to these areas despite the risk:

* exercise caution at all times
* use varied and unpredictable routes and itineraries

### Restrictions on movement

Roadblocks are common and are frequently erected after dark.

Increasingly frequent fuel shortages may impede your ability to move freely at short notice and could lead to unexpected shortages of basic foodstuffs.

* Have your identity and vehicle documents readily available
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Take adequate precautions

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations may occur. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Communications

Telecommunications are unreliable.

There are no fixed telephone lines. Mobile devices don't have full functionality.

There is no international postal service.

### Road safety

Landmines pose a threat, especially outside of Juba.

Road conditions are extremely poor. Many roads are unpaved and poorly maintained. A four-wheel-drive vehicle is required, except in some urban areas such as Juba and Malakal, especially during the rainy season from March to November.

You should only undertake desert travel if you are experienced and fully equipped. Basic equipment should include:

* a shovel
* metal ramps for heavy sand
* a GPS device
* spare fuel
* water and food supplies

Unpredictable local driving habits, pedestrians and roaming animals pose risks.

### Public transportation

A few taxis are available in urban centres but are generally old and uncomfortable.

Public transportation is limited outside of major urban areas.

Most other buses are irregularly scheduled, poorly maintained and very badly driven. Fatal accidents involving buses are routine and increasing.

Only use top-of-the-line buses.

### Air travel

We don't make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.
