### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

South Sudanese law prohibits sexual acts between individuals of the same sex. Public displays of affection between members of the opposite sex are frowned upon.

2SLGBTQI+ persons have experienced harassment and verbal abuse.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in South Sudan.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of South Sudan, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and South Sudan.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in South Sudan by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in South Sudan to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Dress and behaviour

South Sudan is a traditional, conservative society. Women should dress conservatively and should avoid:

* mini skirts
* bare arms
* low necklines

### Money

The currency is the South Sudan pound (SSP). The Sudanese pound (SDG) is not recognized as legal tender.

Transferring U.S. or Canadian dollars to the country is difficult. Currency exchange houses and merchants do not accept U.S. currency dated before 2006 and will reject notes with any marks.

Credit cards are only accepted in South Sudan in limited locations such as:

* major hotels
* some restaurants
* shopping centers
* supermarkets

There are automated teller machines (ATMs), but they are not reliable, and only dispense South Sudanese pounds. You must pay in cash for larger expenses, such as hotel bills.

There is currently a vast and growing disparity between the official exchange and black-market rates for South Sudanese pounds. It is illegal to exchange currency except in authorized locations, such as banks and exchange bureaus.

* Carry sufficient funds in U.S. dollars to cover your expenses for the duration of your stay
* Expect to pay for all international flights booked in South Sudan in U.S. dollars
