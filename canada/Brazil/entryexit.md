# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

The authorities of a country or territory decide who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Brazilian authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for the duration of your stay in Brazil.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Dual citizenship

If you’re both a Canadian and a Brazilian citizen, you must enter and exit Brazil using your Brazilian passport.

### Children and travel

Brazil has strict requirements for the exit of its citizens under the age of 18, including those with dual citizenship.

A travel authorization is mandatory for all Brazilian children leaving Brazil unaccompanied, with one parent, or with a third party.

The parent or legal guardian authorizing the trip must present the following documents:

* an original identification document of the person authorizing the trip
* an original or photocopy of the minor’s Brazilian or foreign passport, which will be used for the trip
* an original or certified photocopy of the minor’s Brazilian birth certificate
