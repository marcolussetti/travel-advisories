# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Border areas

Criminal activity related to drug trafficking and arms smuggling poses a threat to your personal security.

If you choose to travel near border areas

* exercise caution at all times
* monitor local media for the latest information
* follow the instructions of local authorities and security forces

### Major urban centres

#### Vulnerable neighbourhoods

Vulnerable neighbourhoods, commonly referred to as “favelas” or “comunidades,” are characterized by informal housing developments, crowded quarters, poorer conditions and/or irregular construction. They are located throughout major cities.

Gang-related violence and organized crime is prevalent in these neighbourhoods. Armed clashes and shootouts between security forces and alleged criminals occur regularly. There is a risk of violence spilling over to neighbouring areas, including affluent neighbourhoods and tourist destinations.

Gangs strictly control access to these neighbourhoods. Tourists have been killed after accidentally entering on foot or when following GPS directions while driving. These neighbourhoods are not safe for outsiders, even if they are accompanied by a local guide. Access and assistance from emergency service providers is very limited.

In Rio de Janeiro, Complexo da Maré and Complexo da Penha are especially dangerous.

* Ask your hotel, travel agency, or trusted locals for assistance in identifying the favelas in the area where you are travelling
* Ensure your GPS or navigation application does not direct you through a favela

#### Other high-crime areas

Crime rates are high throughout the country, particularly in:

* Belém
* Fortaleza
* Manaus
* Recife
* Rio de Janeiro
* Salvador
* São Paulo

Tourists are mostly affected by theft, but could also become victims of violent crime, which often occurs in the following areas:

* São Paulo:

+ around São Paulo Cathedral
+ Avenida Paulista
+ historical downtown area
+ Municipal Market
+ Pinacoteca (Pina) do Estado de São Paulo
+ Princess Isabel Square
+ Luz station

* Satellite cities of Brasília:

+ Ceilândia
+ Estrutural
+ Paranoá
+ Santa Maria
+ São Sebastião

* Rio de Janeiro:

+ Cidade de Deus to Gardênia Azul and surrounding area
+ Complexo do Alemão
+ Complexo do Turano
+ Jacarezinho
+ Morro do Borel to Morro do Andaraí and surrounding area
+ Morro do Juramento and surrounding area
+ Morro do Urubu and surrounding area
+ Vila Kennedy to Vila Aliança and surrounding area

Armed criminal groups operate in multiple parts of Rio de Janeiro, and armed confrontations with security forces occur regularly. Security conditions can deteriorate rapidly and without warning, particularly during police or military operations.

If you decide to travel to these areas:

* always be aware of your surroundings
* avoid going out after dark
* travel in groups
* avoid isolated areas
* do not resist an attack

### Crime

#### Violent crime

Violent crime occurs, including:

* armed robberies
* carjackings
* burglaries
* sexual assaults

Violent crime, often involving weapons, is common. Mass shootings occur, often resulting in casualties.

Although tourists are rarely involved, you could be in the wrong place at the wrong time.

#### Theft

Robberies occur regularly and often involve weapons such as guns and knives. Thieves generally target people who appear wealthy, such as those using cell phones and laptops.

Robberies can occur anywhere, including in all touristic areas in Rio de Janiero (such as Lapa, Santa Teresa and Copacabana beach). Exercise caution in crowded areas.

Drive-by snatching by armed thieves on motorcycles occurs regularly, particularly in São Paulo and Porto Alegre.

* Always keep car doors and windows closed and locked
* If you feel threatened while driving, do not stop

Mass robberies “arrastões” involve a group of criminals that swarm public places and snatch valuable items such as cash, jewellery and cell phones. This type of crime can occur day and night at:

* beaches
* traffic jams
* shopping centres
* restaurants

Criminals sometimes attempt to rob you by pretending to sell you something or by offering to help if you appear lost. If you’re lost, go into a nearby business or hotel to ask for directions.

Victims have been seriously injured or killed when resisting perpetrators, who were armed or under the influence of drugs.

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing, purse and cell phone snatching, and car theft, is common in Brazil’s large cities. This includes all touristic areas of Rio de Janiero and São Paulo. Exercise caution in crowded areas.

Theft commonly occurs at or near:

* beaches
* outdoor markets
* hotels
* bars and nightclubs
* airports and bus stations
* parking lots

Petty crime increases around big events and festivities, such as:

* parades and street festivals
* large-scale sporting events
* international conferences
* Carnival
* Christmas

During your trip:

* keep your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, in a secure place
* be aware of your surroundings, especially in busy tourist areas
* do not carry large sums of cash or valuables unnecessarily
* do not show signs of affluence or wear expensive jewellery
* avoid using your cell phone in public
* do not resist an attack

### Spiked food and drinks

Spiked food and drink incidents are increasing in Brazil, particularly in Rio de Janeiro.

Incidents of spiked food and drinks to force victims to use their debit or credit card to withdraw money from ATMs have been reported, including on beaches in Rio de Janeiro and in crowded restaurants and bars in São Paulo. Be cautious when meeting new acquaintances, such as people met on dating websites or who approach you in a nightlife setting.

The use of drugs to facilitate sexual assault and robbery against foreigners has also been reported. Assaults frequently occur in unofficial taxis.

Incidents are most likely to occur:

* in bars and restaurants
* in hotels
* in nightclubs
* at public beaches

While you’re in Brazil:

* be wary of accepting items from new acquaintances
* never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers
* order drinks in sealed bottles or cans instead of in plastic cups

### Adulterated alcohol

People have died in Brazil after drinking methanol-adulterated alcohol. Poisoning incidents have been reported in various locations across the states of São Paulo and Pernambuco, and in Brasília. Adulterated drinks include gin, whiskey and vodka sold in bars and liquor stores.

Brazil’s Ministry of Health advises not to consume these beverages until further notice and to seek medical assistance immediately if you begin to feel sick within 12 to 24 hours after consuming an alcoholic beverage.

Be cautious if you choose to drink alcohol.

### Express kidnappings

Express kidnappings occur in the Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Region.

Criminals may kidnap a victim for a few hours and force them to withdraw funds from an ATM or make bank transfers using their mobile applications in exchange for their release. Thieves may put drugs into food and drinks, temporarily incapacitating victims, who become quickly disoriented and are vulnerable to kidnapping.

* Always exercise caution
* Only use reputable taxi companies or ride-sharing applications
* Do not accept rides from new acquaintances or strangers
* Avoid showing signs of affluence, such as using a cell phone, headphones or wearing jewelry
* Never leave food or drinks unattended
* Avoid isolates areas, especially alone or at night

### Carjackings

Carjackings are common in cities, especially at night in remote areas. They often occur at intersections and in tunnels. Perpetrators usually carry weapons.

* Keep doors and windows closed and locked at all times
* Pay attention to your surroundings while waiting at traffic lights
* Avoid poorly lit areas
* Avoid stopping on the side of roads
* Be wary of strangers offering to help you

### Women’s safety

Sexual assault has been committed, including against foreign women.

Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment or verbal abuse.

* Avoid walking alone at night, including on public beaches
* Keep your hotel doors and windows closed and locked
* Do not accept offers of transportation from strangers

If you’re the victim of a sexual assault or other crime, you should report it immediately to the police and the nearest Government of Canada office.

### Home invasions

Home invasions by armed gangs occur, especially in December and January, when many people leave for summer or Christmas holidays. Affluent neighbourhoods and foreigners’ homes have been targeted by criminals due to perceived wealth.

Be aware that police response often takes time.

### Organized crime

Organized crime associated with international drug trafficking occurs in Brazil, as it is situated along transit routes. This is most common in the north and northeastern regions.

### Scams

Common tourist scams include:

* carrying unsuspected drug packages
* online romance scams

Brazil is a drug trafficking hub. An increasing number of travellers have fallen victim to scams in which illegal drugs are hidden inside luggage that an acquaintance asked them to take with them when departing Brazil. Websites targeting senior citizens are reportedly a source of such scams.

Romance scams on dating sites or through social media have occurred. Victims of these scams have been:

* tricked into carrying unsuspected drug packages
* kidnapped
* forced to transfer and withdraw money

Before travelling to Brazil to visit someone you met online:

* be wary of individuals who ask you to carry a package from Brazil on their behalf
* beware of people who show a keen interest in you online

### Fraud

#### Credit card, debit card and ATM fraud

Credit and debit card as well as ATM fraud occurs frequently. Criminals have used proximity card readers to charge the cards of unsuspecting persons. Vendors have also pretended card readers weren’t working or didn’t have signal to charge the client multiple times.

When using your debit or credit card:

* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* pay careful attention when others are handling your cards
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* use ATMs located in public areas or inside a bank or business
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements
* consider disabling the tap function of your card
* carefully check the amount being charged on the card reader’s screen

#### Cybercrime

Cybercrime, malware attacks and online extortion occur in Brazil. Criminals can compromise public Wi-Fi networks to steal personal data or credit information.

* Be cautious when posting information or photos on social media
* Use your own USB adaptor or carry an extra battery pack
* Use secure public Wi-Fi networks
* Beware of people who show a keen interest in you online

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations occur frequently. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

[Mass gatherings (large-scale events)](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/mass-gatherings)

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Brazilian law doesn't criminalize sexual acts or relationships between persons of the same sex.

However, 2SLGBTQI+ persons in Brazil have been victims of violence based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or sex characteristics. Violent incidents include physical assault resulting in severe injury.

Public displays of affection are more socially acceptable in larger cities, but they are not generally acceptable in most of the country.

### Soccer matches and sports events

Sports events sometimes lead to rowdy behaviour and violent incidents.

* Avoid wearing team colours during soccer game days
* Be vigilant if you attend soccer matches and sports rallies
* Leave as soon as possible if violence breaks out

### Swimming

Some beaches are unsupervised. Coastal waters can be dangerous as riptides are common. Public beaches in major cities are often polluted and unfit for swimming.

* Respect the areas reserved for swimming
* Always respect warning flags advising of dangerous conditions
* Be wary of sharks, especially in Brazil’s northeast near Recife
* Follow the instructions of local authorities

### Adventure travel

Outdoor activities, such as hiking, can be dangerous in remote areas as trails may become impassable due to flash floods.

Mobile phone coverage may be limited in remote areas.

Extreme sports, such as skydiving and bungee jumping, are dangerous and tour operators may not meet Canadian safety standards. Certain adventure activities, such as hot air ballooning, are both dangerous and illegal.

If you intend to participate in adventure travel activities:

* share your itinerary with a friend or family member if hiking alone
* stay on marked trails and consider hiring an experienced guide from a reputable company
* obtain detailed information on your activity and the environment in which you will be setting out
* refrain from using equipment if you are unsure of its condition or safety

### Power outages

Power outages occur regularly in major cities. Transport and business services can be disrupted. Most large hotels are equipped with a generator.

### Roads

#### Road safety

Fatal accidents are frequent.

Roadside assistance is not widely available. If you need it, call your vehicle insurance provider, or choose a commercial service available in your area.

#### Road conditions

Road conditions are generally good in large cities and on federal highways, especially those linking large cities. Regional highways are generally adequate but state and municipal roads in rural areas are often poorly maintained.

Driving can also be dangerous due to:

* lack of traffic signs
* potholes
* unpaved roads
* insufficient lighting
* landslides

#### Driving habits

Drivers often disregard traffic laws, and Brazilian police do not strictly enforce them.

Drivers often speed and they can be aggressive and reckless. Motorcyclists often ride between lanes. Be careful when crossing the street, as drivers do not always give pedestrians the right of way.

Drinking and driving is common.

At night and in large cities, drivers commonly treat red lights as stop signs to protect against hold-ups at intersections.

If you choose to drive in Brazil:

* always keep doors and windows closed and locked
* be careful with motorcycles when changing lanes
* if you feel threatened, do not stop
* if you are in a traffic accident, call the police immediately
* never confront the driver of another vehicle

### Transportation

Public transportation can be very crowded at peak transit times, and pickpocketing is common at bus and subway stations. Be extremely cautious when using public transportation at night.

When travelling to and from Rio de Janeiro’s international airport:

* only use authorized taxis, reputable ride-sharing services or transfers arranged by hotels or trusted organizations
* do not make unnecessary stops en route
* avoid public transportation, particularly buses
* follow routes recommended by accommodation staff and remain alert throughout the journey

#### Subway

Petty theft is common in the subway system, especially when crowded.

There are subway cars reserved for women and children in Rio de Janeiro and Brasília.

#### Buses and coaches

There have been reports of theft and violence on city buses in Rio de Janeiro and near vulnerable neighbourhoods across the country, especially during rush hour.

Inter-city buses are generally reliable. Ensure that you use a reputable company before you book your travel.

Bus accidents occur regularly.

Major bus services charge fixed, pre-paid rates.

Do not use public vans.

#### Taxis

Assaults, thefts, and scams often occur in unofficial taxis.

Registered taxis are identifiable by their red licence plates and have a taxi meter to determine the legal fare.

In Brasília, most registered taxis are white with a green sign on the doors. In Rio de Janeiro, most registered taxis are yellow with a blue stripe and have a company’s name labelled near the blue stripe at the back. Malls and the airport often have their own registered taxis.

* Only use officially marked taxis
* Arrange your pickup with your hotel before arrival when travelling by air, or use authorized taxis at the airport
* Avoid paying with cards

#### Ride-sharing applications

Ride-sharing applications are available in Brazil. If you use one, confirm the driver’s identity and the licence plate before getting in the car.

### Piracy

Pirate attacks and armed robberies against ships occur in coastal waters in the north-east. Pirates have also attacked lodges along the Amazon River. Travellers should take appropriate precautions.
