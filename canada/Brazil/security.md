#### Theft

Robberies occur regularly and often involve weapons such as guns and knives. Thieves generally target people who appear wealthy, such as those using cell phones and laptops.

Robberies can occur anywhere.

Drive-by snatching by armed thieves on motorcycles occurs regularly, particularly in São Paulo and Porto Alegre.

* Keep car windows and doors locked at all times
* If you feel threatened while driving, do not stop

Mass robberies (*arrastões*) involve a group of criminals that swarm public places and snatch valuable items such as cash, jewellery and cell phones. This type of crime can occur day and night at:

* beaches
* traffic jams
* shopping centres
* restaurants

Criminals sometimes attempt to rob you by offering to help you if you appear lost. If you’re lost, go into a nearby business or hotel to ask for directions.

Victims have been seriously injured or killed when resisting perpetrators, who were armed or under the influence of drugs.

#### Petty crime

Petty crime increases around big events and festivities, such as:

* large-scale sporting events
* international conferences
* Carnival
* Christmas

Foreign tourists are most affected by theft. Petty theft, including pickpocketing, purse snatching and car theft, is common in Brazil’s large cities.

Thefts commonly occur at or near:

* beaches
* outdoor markets
* hotels
* bars and nightclubs
* airports and bus stations
* parking lots

During your trip:

* keep your personal belongings, including your passport and your other travel documents in a secure place

### Spiked food and drinks

Spiked food and drink incidents are increasing in Brazil, particularly in Rio de Janeiro.

Incidents of spiked food and drinks to force victims to use their debit or credit card to withdraw money from ATMs have been reported, including on beaches in Rio de Janeiro and crowded restaurants in São Paulo.

The use of drugs to facilitate sexual assault and robbery against foreigners has also been reported. Assaults frequently occur in unofficial taxis.

Incidents are most likely to occur:

* in bars and restaurants
* in hotels
* in nightclubs
* at public beaches

While you’re in Brazil:

* be wary of accepting items from new acquaintances
* never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers
* ask for drinks coming from sealed bottles or cans instead of in plastic cups

### Express kidnappings

The number of kidnappings in the Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan area has significantly increased since 2022.

Criminals may kidnap a victim for a few hours and force them to withdraw funds at an ATM for their release. Thieves may put drugs into food and drinks, temporarily incapacitating victims, who become quickly disoriented and are vulnerable to kidnapping.

* Only use reputable cab companies or ride-sharing apps
* Avoid showing signs of affluence, such as using cell phones, headphones and wearing jewelry

### Carjackings

Carjacking is common in cities, especially at night in remote areas. Theft often occurs at intersections and in tunnels. Perpetrators usually carry weapons.

* Keep doors and windows locked at all times
* Pay attention to your surroundings while waiting at traffic lights
* Avoid poorly lit areas
* Avoid stopping on the side of highways
* Be wary of strangers offering to help you

### Home invasions

Home invasions by armed gangs occur, especially in December and January, when many people take summer or Christmas holidays. Affluent neighbourhoods and foreigners’ homes have been targeted by criminals due to perceived wealth.

Be aware that police response often takes time.

### Organized crime

Organized crime associated with international drug trafficking occurs in Brazil, as it is situated along transit routes. This is most common in the north and northeastern regions.

#### Drug trafficking

An increasing number of travellers, particularly senior citizens, report having been used as unwitting drug couriers.

Penalties for drug-related criminal activities are severe. Even unsuspecting individuals transporting packages containing narcotics can be criminally charged and face long jail sentences.

Be wary of individuals, even those you know, who ask you to carry a suitcase from Brazil on their behalf.

### Vulnerable neighbourhoods

Vulnerable neighbourhoods, commonly referred to as “favelas” or “comunidades”, are characterized by informal housing developments, crowded quarters, poorer conditions, and/or irregular construction.

Gang-related violence and organized crime is prevalent in these areas.  Access and assistance from emergency services is very limited.

Avoid renting accommodations in vulnerable neighbourhoods, and travelling to these areas, even on a guided tour.

#### Police operations

Armed clashes and shootouts between security forces and alleged criminals regularly occur in vulnerable neighbourhoods. Police operations have led to retaliation by criminal gangs. Vulnerable neighbourhoods are located across major cities. As a result, there is risk of violence spilling over to neighbouring areas, including affluent neighbourhoods and tourist destinations. There have been casualties as a result of stray bullets in and near vulnerable neighbourhoods.

### Scams

Common tourist scams include:

* carrying unsuspected drug packages
* online romance scams

Brazil is a drug trafficking hub. An increasing number of travellers have fallen victim to scams in which illegal drugs are hidden inside luggage that an acquaintance asked them to take with them when departing Brazil. Websites targeting senior citizens are reportedly a source of such scams.

Romance scams on dating sites or through social media have occurred. If you fall victim to a scam, you may be:

* a drug courier
* kidnapped
* forced to transfer and withdraw money

Before travelling to Brazil to visit someone you met online:

* be wary of individuals who ask you to carry a package from Brazil on their behalf
* beware of people who show a keen interest in you online

### Fraud

#### Credit card and ATM fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud occur frequently. Criminals have used proximity card readers to charge the credit cards of unsuspecting persons.

When using your debit or credit card:

* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* pay careful attention when others are handling your cards
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* use ATMs located in public areas or inside a bank or business
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements
* consider disabling the tap function of your credit card

#### Cybercrime

Cybercrime, malware attacks and online extortion occur in Brazil. Criminals can compromise public Wi-Fi networks to steal personal data or credit information.

* Be cautious when posting information or photos on social media
* Use your own USB adaptor or carry an extra battery pack
* Use secure public Wi-Fi networks
* Beware of people who show a keen interest in you online

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations occur frequently. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

2SLGBTQI+ persons in Brazil have been victims of violence based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or sex characteristics. Violent incidents include physical assault resulting in severe injury. Public displays of affection are more socially acceptable in larger cities, but they are not normally acceptable in most of the country.

### Soccer matches and sports events

Sports events sometimes lead to rowdy behaviour and violent incidents.

* Avoid wearing team colours during soccer game days
* Be vigilant if you attend soccer matches and sports rallies
* Leave as soon as possible if violence breaks out

### Swimming

Coastal waters can be dangerous as riptides are common. Public beaches in major cities are often polluted and unfit for swimming.

* Respect the areas reserved for swimming
* Always respect warning flags advising of dangerous conditions
* Be wary of sharks, especially in Brazil’s northeast near Recife
* Follow the instructions of local authorities

### Adventure tourism

Outdoor activities, such as hiking, can be dangerous in remote areas as trails may become impassable due to flash floods.

Extreme sports, such as skydiving and bungee jumping, are dangerous and tour operators may not meet Canadian safety standards. Certain adventure activities, such as hot air ballooning, are both dangerous and illegal.

If you intend to participate in adventure tourism activities:

* share your itinerary with a friend or family member if hiking alone
* stay on marked trails and consider hiring an experienced guide from a reputable company
* obtain detailed information on your activity and on the environment in which you will be setting out
* refrain from using equipment if you are unsure of its condition or safety

### Electricity outages

Power shortages occur regularly in major cities. Transport and business services can be disrupted. Most large hotels are equipped with a generator.

### Road safety

Fatal accidents are frequent.

Roadside assistance is not widely available. If you need roadside assistance, call your vehicle insurance provider, or choose a commercial service available in your area.

#### Road conditions

Road conditions are generally good in large cities and on federal highways, especially those linking large cities. Regional highways are generally adequate but state and municipal roads in rural areas are often poorly maintained.

Driving can also be dangerous due to:

* lack of traffic signs
* potholes
* unpaved roads
* insufficient lighting
* landslides
* driving under the influence of alcohol

#### Driving habits

Drivers often disregard traffic laws, and Brazilian police do not strictly enforce them.

Drivers often speed and they can be aggressive and reckless. Motorcyclists often ride between lanes. Be careful when crossing the street, as drivers do not always give pedestrians the right of way.

Drinking and driving is common.

At night and in large cities, drivers commonly treat red lights as stop signs to protect against hold-ups at intersections.

If you choose to drive:

* be careful of motorbikes when changing lanes
* if you feel threatened at any time, do not stop
* if you are in a traffic accident, call the police immediately
* never confront the driver of another vehicle

### Public transportation

Public transportation can be very crowded at peak transit times, and pickpocketing is common at bus and subway stations. Be extremely cautious when using public transportation at night.

#### Subway

Petty theft is common in the subway system, especially when crowded.

There are subway cars reserved for women and children in Rio de Janeiro and Brasilia.

#### Buses and coaches

There have been reports of theft and violence on city buses in Rio de Janeiro and near vulnerable neighbourhoods across the country, especially during rush hour.

Inter-city buses are generally reliable. Ensure that you use a reputable company before you book your travel.

Bus accidents occur regularly.

Major bus services charge fixed, pre-paid rates.

Do not use public vans.

#### Taxis

Assaults, thefts, and scams often occur in unofficial taxis.

Registered taxis are identifiable and have a taxi meter to determine the legal fare. In Brasilia, most registered taxis are white with a green sign on the doors. In Rio de Janeiro, most registered taxis are yellow with a blue stripe and have a company’s name labelled near the blue stripe at the back. Malls and the airport often have their own registered taxis.

* Only use officially marked taxis
* Arrange your pickup with your hotel before arrival when travelling by air, or use authorized cabs at the airport
* Avoid paying with credit cards

#### Ridesharing apps

Ridesharing apps are available in Brazil. If you use a ridesharing app, confirm the driver’s identity and the licence plate before getting in the car.

### Piracy

Pirate attacks and armed robbery against ships occur in coastal waters in the north-east. Pirates have also attacked lodges along the Amazon River.
