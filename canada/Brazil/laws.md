## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Transfer to a Canadian prison

Canada and Brazil are signatories to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in Brazil to request a transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both Canadian and Brazilian authorities.

This process can take a long time, and there is no guarantee that the transfer will be approved by either or both sides.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect a jail sentence and a heavy fine.

Travellers have fallen victim to scams in which illegal drugs are hidden inside luggage that an acquaintance has asked them to take away from Brazil.

* Pack your own luggage and monitor it closely at all times
* Never transport other people’s packages, bags, or suitcases

### Child sex tourism

Brazil is actively seeking to prevent child sex tourism. Several tourists have been convicted of offences relating to the exploitation of minors.

The legal age of sexual consent in Brazil is 18. Prison sentences are severe.

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Brazil.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Brazil, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### Driving

The legal blood alcohol limit is 0.00% in Brazil. If the police suspect you of drinking and driving, they could confiscate your driver’s licence on the spot. If convicted, you can expect heavy fines and jail sentences. Brazilian police may conduct periodic controls during the day and night, often to check for drunk driving. If you approach a police control, slow down and co-operate with the officers.

You can drive in Brazil for up to 180 days with a valid Canadian driver’s licence.

You should carry an international driving permit. This official Portuguese translation of your Canadian driver’s licence will help when dealing with local authorities.

### Smoking and vaping

Smoking and vaping are prohibited in all enclosed public spaces.

It’s illegal to bring these items into Brazil:

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Brazil.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Brazil, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Brazilian court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Brazil to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Money

The currency of Brazil is the Brazilian real (BRL).

Canadian bank cards usually work in ATMs. Credit and debit cards are widely accepted.

ATMs are scarcely available in rural areas.

Carry cash for small transactions and when visiting remote areas.

It’s difficult to exchange Canadian dollars in Brazil.
