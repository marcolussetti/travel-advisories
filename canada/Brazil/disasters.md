## Natural disasters and climate

### Wildfires

Wildfires are common during the dry season, between May and September, particularly in:

* Amazonas
* Brasília
* Cerrado region
* Pantanal region

Heavy smoke may deteriorate the air quality in areas near active fires.

In case of a major fire:

* stay away from the affected area, particularly if you suffer from respiratory ailments
* monitor local media for the latest information
* follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders

### El Niño

The complex weather phenomenon called El Niño happens at irregular intervals of 2 to 7 years. El Niño generally generates droughts and heavy rainfalls for 6 to 9 months, which could cause flooding, landslides, and mudslides, and severely disrupt travel. Extreme droughts and heavy rains could limit access to food, drinking water, hygiene products, and medication. Severe weather could occur, such as:

* below-average rainfall and droughts in the north and northeast
* excessive rains in the south and southeast
* above-average temperatures in all regions

Stay informed of regional weather forecasts before and during your travels, and plan accordingly. Ensure you have adequate insurance to cover the consequences of such events, including the disruption of travel plans.

### Rainy seasons

The rainy seasons extend from:

* January to July in the north
* October to April in the south and southeast
* April to July in the northeast

Flash floods can occur outside of the rainy season.

They can hamper overland travel, especially in rural areas. Roads may become impassable and bridges damaged. Travel conditions on mountain roads and on highways leading to beaches can be dangerous. Seasonal flooding can also reduce the provision of essential services. Power outages are frequent during the rainy season.

* Avoid the affected areas
* Stay informed of the latest regional weather forecasts
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
