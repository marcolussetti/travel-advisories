## Natural disasters and climate

Kazakhstan experiences severe weather conditions, especially in the winter when temperatures can fall below -30°C and strong winds can result in wind chills that make it feel below -50°C.

If you’re travelling outside of urban areas in the winter:

* keep informed of local and regional weather forecasts
* ensure you have emergency supplies and equipment in your vehicle, including:
  + warm clothing
  + a first aid kit
  + food and water

### Seismic activity

Kazakhstan is located in an active seismic zone. Earthquakes occur regularly, particularly in the Almaty region. Landslides are possible in affected areas, and strong aftershocks may occur after the initial quake. Earthquakes may also trigger avalanches in mountainous areas, especially in the spring.

Avalanches and landslides can make roads impassable, cause power disruptions and disturb other essential services.

If an earthquake occurs:

* avoid the affected areas
* monitor local media to stay informed on the evolving situation
* follow the instructions of local authorities

### Wildfires

Wildfires are common throughout the country between July and August, when temperatures can reach +40°C.

The air quality in areas near active fires may deteriorate due to heavy smoke.

In case of a major fire:

* stay away from affected areas, particularly if you suffer from respiratory ailments
* follow the advice of local emergency services personnel
* monitor local media for up-to-date information on the situation

### Air pollution

Industrial pollution is severe in Almaty and Astana, particularly from November to March, when residents burn coal to heat homes and two coal-fired thermoelectric plants operate.

Monitor air pollution levels, which change quickly, especially if you suffer from respiratory ailments or have pre-existing medical conditions.

During periods of high pollution:

* limit your activities outdoors
* monitor local media
* follow the instructions of local authorities
