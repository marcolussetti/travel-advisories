# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing, purse snatching and vehicle break-ins occurs, particularly in Astana and Almaty.

Theft is frequent in or near tourist locations, including:

* public transportation, especially buses
* parks
* shopping areas
* open-air markets
* restaurants
* nightclubs

During your stay:

* exercise caution
* ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* be aware of your surroundings at all times, especially in crowded areas
* don’t walk or travel alone at night
* don’t show signs of affluence or wear expensive jewellery
* don’t carry large amounts of money
* be vigilant if approached by strangers seeking assistance
* don’t leave valuables within reach or in plain sight

#### Violent crime

Violent crime against foreigners rarely occurs. However, there have been reports of attacks, muggings and robbery.

There have been incidents involving tourists outside of bars and nightclubs, especially at night, in Almaty, Astana and Atyrau. Residences of foreigners have also been targets for burglary.

Kazakhstan is a transit country for drugs, but there is also an increase in local production and consumption in urban areas, especially of synthetic drugs. Illicit drug trafficking and use may lead to violent spillovers and street crime.

* Exercise caution
* Avoid areas that seem unsafe
* Don’t walk alone at night
* Choose living accommodations that have adequate security measures
* When at home, don’t open your door to strangers under any circumstance
* Keep windows and doors locked at all times

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism.

Terrorist attacks could occur at any time.

Targets could include:

* government buildings and military installations
* schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

Be particularly vigilant during:

* sporting events
* religious holidays
* public celebrations
* major political events, such as elections

Terrorists may use such occasions to mount attacks.

### Fraud

#### Credit and debit cards

Credit and debit card as well ATM fraud occur.

* Pay careful attention when others are handling your cards
* Use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank
* Avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* Cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* Check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

#### Cybercrime

Cybercrime occurs frequently in Kazakhstan, especially online extortion and identity theft. There are several reported cases of Canadian citizens transferring money to individuals in Kazakhstan and losing contact with the swindlers once the transaction is completed.

Criminals can compromise public Wi-Fi networks to steal personal data or credit information. They can also monitor social media and listen to your phone conversations.

* Don’t transfer money to strangers
* Don’t share personal information over the phone or online, including on social media
* Avoid using public Wi-Fi networks
* Consider using a virtual private network (VPN) when browsing on the Internet
* Avoid shopping on unencrypted websites
* Don't click on suspicious links that ask for your banking information in an e-mail or text message

#### Fraudulent police officers

Thieves posing as police officers have approached foreign travellers and asked them to pay alleged fines. There are also reported cases of online scams by individuals posing as investigators asking people to confirm their personal information in the context of an ongoing investigation.

If you face a similar situation:

* offer to go to the nearest police station
* ask to see police credentials
* remain vigilant

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations take place occasionally and require approval from local authorities.

In 2022, security forces strongly intervened in large-scale demonstrations across Kazakhstan. The demonstrations led to vandalism and violent clashes between demonstrators and security forces, which resulted in hundreds of casualties.

The situation has since returned to normal without any further disturbances, but you should expect a heightened presence of security forces on or around politically important days.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Spiked food and drinks

Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

### Women’s safety

Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse.

### Road safety

#### Road conditions

Road conditions vary throughout the country. They are generally in good condition in and around major cities, but in rural areas, they are poorly maintained and dangerous due to:

* large potholes
* malfunctioning or absence of traffic lights
* insufficient lighting
* uneven surface
* bad road markings and signage

Fuel shortages occur occasionally, even in major cities and gas stations are limited in rural areas.

If you travel to remote areas:

* keep in mind that services and roadside assistance may be limited
* keep your gas tank full
* make sure that you have an adequate supply of food and water

During winter, driving conditions are hazardous, particularly in the Kazakh Steppe. Roads and highways regularly close due to cold, wind and snow.

#### Driving habits

Drivers are reckless and often disregard traffic laws, especially during rush hours.

Typical behaviours include:

* sudden lane changes without signalling
* driving on the opposite side of the road and astride lanes
* driving and parking on sidewalks
* stopping abruptly

Pedestrians often cross in the middle of the road and drivers don’t always give pedestrians the right of way.

If you’re driving in Kazakhstan:

* always drive defensively
* avoid driving at night
* use main roads and highways as much as possible
* always carry a cellphone and a charger

### Public transportation

#### Buses

In major cities, buses are generally in good condition. However, they are often overcrowded and  pickpockets are common.

* Always carry your valuables and identification with you
* Avoid storing bags in the overhead compartment or under your seat
* Don't take buses that look overloaded or in poor condition

When travelling to or between rural areas, avoid using minibuses called ‘’Marshrutka’’. They often lack security features like seatbelts.

#### Taxis

Official and unofficial taxis operate in Kazakhstan.

Unofficial taxis don’t always have roof-mounted taxi signs and are not always equipped with safety features like seatbelts.

Unofficial taxis may pick up additional passengers, which poses a risk to your safety. There are reports of passengers being overcharged, and becoming victims of robbery, assault and harassment by unmarked taxi drivers.

At airports, some drivers may insist to get you into their car and will significantly overcharge you.

In major cities, there are ridesharing applications through which you can order taxis with generally safer vehicles and fixed fares, except if you select the cheapest category.

If you choose to take taxis during your stay:

* order your taxi at the reception if you are staying at a hotel
* don’t use unmarked taxis
* never share a taxi with strangers
* confirm the fare in advance
* have small bills available for payment

#### Trains

While rail service is reliable and relatively safe, onboard robberies do occur.

* Make sure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Don’t leave your compartment unattended
* Keep the door locked from the inside
