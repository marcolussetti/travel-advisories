## Safety and security

### Crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs in Bonaire.

Residential break-ins and theft from vehicles, hotel rooms and rental units also take place.

* Ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Never leave valuables such as jewellery, cell phones, electronics, wallets or bags unattended on the beach or in your vehicle
* Avoid unpopulated areas and unpatrolled beaches after dark
* Check with local authorities to determine which beaches are safe

### Water activities

Coastal waters can be dangerous. Rescue services may not be consistent with Canadian standards.

Follow the instructions and warnings of local authorities.

If you are planning to take part in water sports such as scuba diving, jet skiing or parasailing:

* ensure that equipment is safe and in good condition
* ensure helmets and life jackets are available
* avoid participating in any water activities when you are under the influence of alcohol or other substances
* check that your travel insurance covers accidents related to recreational activities

### Wildlife viewing

Wild animals can be dangerous, particularly if you are on foot or at close range.

* Always maintain a safe distance when observing wildlife
* Only exit a vehicle when a professional guide or warden says it’s safe to do so
* Only use reputable and professional guides or tour operators
* Closely follow park regulations and wardens’ advice

### Road safety

Major roads are in good condition, but many drivers don’t respect traffic laws.

Animals on the road pose a hazard.

Road signs are different from Canada. Familiarize yourself with the signs before driving.

### Public transportation

Public transportation in Bonaire is fairly limited. There is no public bus system operating. Taxis are the only form of public transportation on the island.

#### Taxis

Taxis in Bonaire must be registered and have license plates marked with “TX”.

Taxis are not metered and operate on a flat rate by destination set by the government. Despite the regulated price, agree on a fare prior to departure.

### Air travel

We don't make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.
