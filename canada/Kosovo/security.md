# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Kosovo

Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia in 2008. Serbia doesn’t recognize Kosovo as an independent state. Ethnic tensions between Kosovo Serbs and Kosovo Albanians are ongoing.

There is a risk of inter-ethnic violence and civil unrest, particularly in the municipalities of:

* Leposavić
* North Mitrovica
* Zubin Potok
* Zvečan

Occasional security incidents may include:

* shootings
* arson and grenade attacks
* violent and spontaneous protests
* attacks on government buildings and police forces

Since September 2023, NATO and Kosovo Police forces have increased their presence in these municipalities.

However, tensions may escalate rapidly.

Avoid non-essential travel to these areas. If you travel to northern Kosovo despite this advisory:

* remain vigilant at all times
* monitor local media for information on the security situation
* avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* follow the instructions of local authorities

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Crimes of opportunity and petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occur. Thieves could target foreigners, particularly in Pristina and in crowded public areas such as:

* markets
* public transportation hubs and facilities
* hotel lobbies
* restaurants, patios and outdoor cafés
* tourist sites and attractions

While you’re in Kosovo:

* ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* don’t keep your passport and other types of ID in the same place and carry a photocopy rather than the original
* avoid showing signs of affluence or wearing expensive jewellery
* avoid carrying large sums of cash or unnecessary valuables
* avoid deserted streets at night
* pay attention to your surroundings, particularly in crowded and tourist areas
* be extra cautious when withdrawing cash from ATMs

#### Residential break-ins

Residential break-ins occur, especially in main cities. Burglars sometimes target houses or apartments owned or rented by foreigners.

* Choose well-secured accommodation
* Make sure you lock doors and windows at night and when you’re away

#### Vehicles

Car theft, break-ins and carjacking occur. Rental and luxury vehicles are a target of choice.

* Familiarize yourself with your route before starting the trip
* Keep your windows and doors locked at all times
* Keep your belongings out of reach
* Use secure parking facilities, especially overnight
* Never leave belongings unattended in a vehicle, even in the trunk

#### Violent crime

Organized crime-related violence occurs. Criminals often use firearms. In some instances, they have used hand grenades or improvised explosive devices.

While violent incidents don’t typically target foreigners or tourists, there is a risk of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

Always be vigilant and aware of your surroundings.

### Fraud

#### Credit card and ATM fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud occurs. When using debit or credit cards:

* pay careful attention when others are handling your cards  
  use ATMs located in public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

#### Cybercrime

Cybercrime also occurs. Perpetrators may compromise public Wi-Fi networks to steal credit card or personal information.

* Avoid using unsecured public Wi-Fi networks

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations occur occasionally due to ongoing political tension, particularly in Pristina and in the northern areas of Kosovo. They usually take place around governmental or international organizations' buildings.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Soccer matches and sports events

Sports events sometimes lead to rowdy behaviour and violent incidents.

Be vigilant if you attend soccer matches and sports rallies.

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in Europe. Terrorist attacks have occurred in a number of European cities. Terrorist attacks could occur at any time.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places. Be particularly vigilant during:

* sporting events
* religious holidays
* public celebrations
* major political events, such as elections

Terrorists may use such occasions to mount attacks.

### Landmines and unexploded ordnance

While most of the territory has been cleared, landmines and unexploded ordnance may still pose a serious risk in forested and isolated areas, particularly in:

* the mountainous regions bordering Albania, Montenegro and North Macedonia
* the Dulje Pass in central Kosovo
* the areas bordering Serbia's Preševo Valley

If you plan on visiting or hiking in these areas:

* pay attention to signs indicating the possible presence of landmines
* remain on paved roads
* avoid open fields, road shoulders and unmarked trails
* report anything suspicious to local authorities

### Mountain activities

Mountain activities, such as hiking, can be dangerous, especially if they are not well-organized. Trails are not always marked and weather conditions can change rapidly, even in summer.

If you intend to go hiking or climbing:

* never do so alone
* consider hiring an experienced guide from a reputable company
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* ensure that you’re properly equipped
* stay informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary
* obtain detailed information on trekking routes before setting out
* do not venture off marked trails
* pay attention to signs indicating the possible presence of landmines

### Feral and stray dogs

Feral and stray dogs are common throughout the country.

Don’t approach or feed them as they could be aggressive.

### Power outages

Power and utility outages are frequent in Kosovo, including in Pristina. They may affect the provision of essential services.

* Make sure your phone is and remains charged at all times
* Keep supplies of food, water and fuel on hand in case of lengthy disruptions

### Celebratory gunfire

Firing weapons to celebrate is common in Kosovo. It sometimes coincides with fireworks displays and may take place:

* at weddings
* on certain holidays and days of national observance
* following elections
* after soccer matches and sporting events

Injuries and deaths due to stray bullets have occurred.

Avoid areas where celebratory gunfire is taking place.

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety vary throughout the country.

Secondary roads are often narrow, poorly lit and poorly maintained. Mountain roads sometimes lack guardrails. Low-speed farm equipment, horse-drawn carts and wandering livestock are common hazards.

Roads may also become impassable due to heavy snowfall, mudslides or seasonal flooding.

Drivers don’t always respect traffic laws. They don’t always yield to pedestrians.

Avoid driving at night.

### Public transportation

Safety standards vary on public transportation. Buses and trains are often overcrowded. Periodic disruptions of bus services may occur.

#### Taxis

Taxis are widely available and reliable.

* Use only officially marked taxis
* Negotiate fares in advance, or insist that the driver use the meter, as you may be overcharged
