### Wildfires

Forest fires are common between June and September, particularly in northern Kosovo. The air quality in areas near active fires may deteriorate due to heavy smoke.

In case of a significant fire:

* stay away from affected areas, particularly if you suffer from respiratory ailments
* monitor local media for up-to-date information on the situation
* follow the advice of local authorities

### Flooding and landslides

Heavy rains, particularly during spring and summer, can cause flooding and landslides. Roads may become impassable and infrastructure damaged. The road between Pristina and Skopje, North Macedonia, is particularly affected by these incidents.

* Exercise caution, particularly in areas around major rivers
* Stay informed of the latest regional weather forecasts
* Follow the advice of local authorities, including evacuation orders

### Air pollution

Smoke haze and other types of air pollution can be extremely hazardous in Kosovo. Winter is especially problematic due the heavy smoke from coal and wood burning heaters. Air pollution levels can change quickly.

During periods of high pollution:

* limit your outdoor activities, especially if you suffer from respiratory ailments or have pre-existing medical conditions
* monitor local media
* follow the instructions of local authorities
