# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Kosovar authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for the expected duration of your stay in Kosovo.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Visas

Tourist visa: not required for stays up to 90 days in any 180-day period  
Business visa: not required for stays up to 90 days in any 180-day period  
Student visa: not required for stays up to 90 days in any 180-day period

### Registration

If you plan to spend fewer than 90 days in Kosovo, you don’t need to apply for a residence permit. However, you must register your presence in the country. Commercial accommodations will generally file the declaration on your behalf.

If you’re staying in a non-commercial accommodation, you must file the registration with the nearest police station upon arrival.

If you intend to stay more than 90 days, you must apply for a temporary residence permit at the Foreigner Registration Office in Pristina.

### Other entry requirements

Customs officials may ask you to show them a return or onward ticket and proof of sufficient funds to cover your stay.

### Travel to Serbia

Serbia does not recognize Kosovo as an independent state nor its border crossing points as legal international entry points.

If travelling by land to Serbia from Kosovo, you should transit first via a third country such as Albania, North Macedonia or Montenegro.

Don’t attempt to enter Serbia directly from Kosovo, unless you have a valid entry stamp from the Serbian immigration authorities showing that you initially travelled into Kosovo from Serbia.
