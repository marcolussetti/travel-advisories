### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Kosovo.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Kosovo by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Kosovo to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Money

The currency in Kosovo is the euro (EUR).

The economy is largely cash-based; however, credit cards are accepted in some larger establishments. Automated banking machines are available in urban centres.

If you are carrying €10,000 or more, or the equivalent in other currencies, you must make a declaration to customs when you enter or leave the European Union. It includes sums in:

* banknotes and coins
* bearer negotiable instruments such as cheques, travellers’ cheques, promissory notes and money orders
* bonds, shares
* gold coins with a gold content of at least 90 %
* gold bars, nuggets or clumps with a gold content of at least 99.5 %
* any other convertible asset

This does not apply if you are travelling within the European Union or in transit to a non-EU country.
