## Natural disasters and climate

Climate change is affecting Somalia. Extreme and unusual weather events are becoming more frequent and may affect your travel plans. Monitor local media for the latest information.

The climate in Somalia is very hot and dry. However, there is a rainy season that generally extends from April to June and from October to December. The south and north of the country are usually the most affected areas. There are also shorter rainy seasons in other parts of Somalia.

### Flooding

Seasonal flooding, including flash flooding, can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services, even in larger cities. Roads may become impassable due to mudslides and landslides. Bridges, buildings, and infrastructure may be damaged.

* Monitor local media for the latest information including road conditions
* Stay away from flooded areas
* Monitor weather reports
* Follow instructions from local authorities, including evacuation orders
