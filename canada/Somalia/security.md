# Safety and security

## Safety and security

Despite improvements in some part of the country, your safety and security are at great risk in Somalia. The Canadian government does not have an office in Somalia. This means the Government of Canada cannot provide consular assistance if you are in distress while in the country. In such cases, you would have to rely on your own resources or travel to the nearest Canadian embassy or consulate.

Authorities have limited capacity to maintain security across the country and violent incidents occur regularly. These include:

* suicide bombings
* armed attacks
* military operations
* demonstrations

The current situation represents a very serious threat to travellers. Anti-Western sentiment can be strong and foreign nationals can be targeted. Journalists, human rights activists and humanitarian workers are at very high risk of kidnapping, murder and/or arrest without notice or apparent cause.

### Political situation and demonstrations

The political situation is unpredictable, especially in Mogadishu. Demonstrations can occur with little warning and turn violent at any time. Security forces have used excessive force to disperse crowds, including live ammunition.

If you are in Somalia:

* avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* monitor the local media to stay informed on the evolving situation
* follow the advice of local authorities

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism throughout the country, including in Mogadishu. Fighting over the control of areas between the government and terrorist groups has been ongoing. Attacks against government and civilian targets involving the use of heavy weapons are frequent, including in Mogadishu. Mogadishu Aden Adde International Airport has closed with little or no warning due to mortar attacks, fighting, terrorist attacks or threats.

Civilian casualties are common. Further attacks are likely.

Attacks are unpredictable and can be both targeted and indiscriminate. They often involve the following types of weapons and/or devices:

* suicide vests
* improvised explosive devices (IEDs)
* vehicle-borne IEDs
* rockets and mortars
* assault weapons

Targets could include:

* hotels
* diplomatic missions and NGO offices
* government buildings, including police stations and military bases
* schools, including universities
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

Be particularly vigilant:

* around dates of prior attacks, such as August 7, September 11
* around Somalia’s Independence Day on July 1
* at sporting events
* during religious holidays
* at public celebrations
* at major political events, such as elections

Terrorists may use such occasions to mount attacks.

### Somaliland and Puntland

Tensions and violence are affecting Somaliland and Puntland, semi-autonomous regions within the Republic of Somalia, where violent attacks targeting civilians have occurred. Conflicts often erupt into fighting in the Sanaag and Sool regions of Somaliland along the border with Puntland.

### Border areas

Somalia’s borders with Kenya and Ethiopia remain porous despite being officially closed. Terrorist groups are active along the border with Kenya and continue to carry out cross-border attacks. Some incidents have involved the use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), resulting in casualties.

Border areas with Ethiopia experience inter-communal violence and cross-border criminal activity.

### Kidnappings

Foreigners and Somali nationals are at very high risk of being kidnapped throughout Somalia. Both residents and foreigners have been abducted, often by armed groups, and held captive, until ransom was paid. In some cases, the victims have been executed or reported missing.

### Crime

Petty crime such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs mostly in urban cities. The ability of local authorities to respond may be limited.

Violent crime conducted by armed militias occurs throughout the country. Incidents include:

* armed robberies
* burglaries
* home invasions
* carjackings
* assaults

During your stay:

* stay in accommodations with robust security measures
* keep doors and windows locked at all times
* keep valuables out of sight and reach
* avoid isolated areas
* be extra cautious when withdrawing cash from ATMs
* do not resist an attack

### Landmines

Despite clearing efforts, landmines and unexploded ordnance from past armed conflict still pose hazards across the country.

* Be extremely vigilant, especially in remote areas
* Stay on paved and main roads
* Cross only at official border crossings
* Pay attention to signs indicating the possible presence of unexploded ordnance

If you encounter unexploded ordnance:

* do not get close to or touch them
* move away immediately
* contact the relevant authorities

### Road

Overland travel is extremely dangerous due to the presence of various armed groups controlling checkpoints.

If you must undertake overland travel:

* ensure to be accompanied by vetted and armed security guards
* always travel in groups
* follow the instructions of security forces
* do not travel at night

#### Road safety

There are major safety issues in Somalia. The number of road accidents is high and often involve pedestrians. Police and emergency services assistance is limited, particularly in rural areas.

#### Road conditions

Roads are in poor condition and can be dangerous due to:

* insufficient lighting
* potholes
* unpaved roads
* poorly maintained vehicles
* lack of traffic signs
* the presence of animals, pedestrians and cyclists on the road

### Women’s safety

Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse. Women are typically expected to wear traditional Islamic dress, though it is not a legal requirement.

### Forced marriage and forced to travel and remain abroad

Some Canadians have been forced into marriage against their will and without their consent in Somalia. Family and/or community members have used emotional pressure, threats, abduction, or even physical violence to coerce individuals to marry in Somalia. Sometimes, the affected individual doesn’t know in advance about the planned marriage, but once they arrive in the country, their passport and money may be taken to prevent them from returning to Canada.

While both men and women experience forced marriage, it is a form of violence most commonly perpetrated against women and girls.

Some Canadians have reported being forced to travel or to remain in Somalia against their will. Once abroad, family members have confiscated the person’s passport and cellphone and withheld money to prevent them from returning to Canada. In some cases, family members have used deception or coercion to admit individuals and forcibly confine them in certain facilities claiming to offer medical, religious, or cultural "rehabilitation" services. These facilities may operate with little or no licensing or oversight, and incidents of abuse have been reported.

**If you’re in Canada**

If you’re in Canada and believe that you’re being forced to travel to Somalia to marry and/or to be left abroad against your will, you may want to consider the following safety measures:

* try to avoid or delay your travel
* share your concerns and travel details with a trusted person, such a teacher, counselor, friend or neighbour who can help you find support
* maintain control over your passport and other important documents
* contact your local police for immediate assistance

**If you’re in Somalia**

If you’re in Somalia and believe that you’re being forced to marry or are being kept abroad against your will and prevented from returning to Canada:

* contact the nearest office of the Government of Canada
* contact the 24/7 [Emergency Watch and Response Centre](https://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-assistance)

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Somalian law criminalizes sexual acts between individuals of the same sex, as well as any act deemed “offensive to modesty” by the local authorities. Persons accused of homosexuality risk harsh penalties, including lengthy prison sentences or the death penalty. 2SLGBTQI+ persons can be victims of discrimination, harassment and acts of violence based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression or sexual characteristics.

2SLGBTQI+ persons should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Somalia.

### Power outages

Power outages occur regularly throughout the entire country.

Power outages often impact essential services, such as:

* public lighting and traffic lights
* public water supply
* telecommunications

### Telecommunications

International telephone services and Internet access are limited to larger cities and unreliable.

### Piracy

Pirate attacks and armed robbery against ships occur in coastal waters. Mariners should take appropriate precautions.
