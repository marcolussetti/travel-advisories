# Safety and security

## Safety and security

There is no resident Canadian government office in Somalia; therefore, the Government of Canada can’t provide consular assistance to you if you are in distress in Somalia. If so, you will have to make your way to the nearest Canadian embassy or consulate or rely on your own resources.

The rule of law is virtually non-existent. Violent demonstrations, suicide bombings, attacks and military activity occur regularly. The current situation represents a very serious threat to travellers. Be aware that anti-Western sentiment may at times be strong. Foreign travellers, including journalists, human rights activists and humanitarian workers, are at very high risk of kidnapping, murder and arrest without notice or apparent cause.

If you choose to travel to Somalia despite this advisory, you may have difficulty in departing the country.

### Political situation

The political situation is unpredictable, especially in Mogadishu.

Clashes between security forces and protesters have occurred. There has also been an increase in attacks within the capital, resulting in civilian casualties and infrastructure damage.

Similar incidents could occur without warning. Demonstrations could also occur and turn violent at any time.

If you are in Somalia:

* monitor the local media to stay informed on the evolving situation
* follow the advice of local authorities

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism, particularly in south-central Somalia and in the capital, Mogadishu. Fighting over the control of these areas between the government (supported by international troops), and terrorist groups has been ongoing. Attacks against government targets involving the use of heavy weapons are frequent, particularly in Mogadishu. Civilian casualties are not uncommon. Further attacks are likely.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

High-profile events could also be targeted

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

### Somaliland and Puntland

Somaliland (a self-declared republic seeking independence) and Puntland (an administrative region in the northeast) have remained more stable than the south-central part of the country. Nonetheless, violent attacks on foreign targets have occurred in these regions.

Inter-clan conflicts often erupt into fighting in the Sanaag and Sool regions of Somaliland along the border with Puntland. Tensions and violence in the south of the country could spread to Somaliland and Puntland at any time.

### Kidnappings

Foreigners are at very high risk of being kidnapped throughout Somalia, including in Somaliland. Several Westerners, including humanitarian workers, have been kidnapped.

### Crime

There are high levels of crime conducted by armed militias throughout the country. Armed robberies, carjackings and murders occur regularly.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations take place frequently and can turn violent at any time.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Border closures

The land border between Kenya and Somalia remains closed and air traffic between the two countries is subject to special procedures by the Kenyan government.

Mogadishu Aden Adde International Airport is often closed with little or no warning due to fighting.

### Tourist facilities

Tourist facilities are not available.

### Outages

Electricity and water provisions are not assured.

International telephone services and Internet access are limited to larger cities, where services are unreliable.

### Piracy

Pirate attacks and armed robbery against ships occur in coastal waters. Mariners should take appropriate precautions.
