### Forced marriage

Forced marriage affecting foreigners occur. It sometimes occurs without the affected person’s prior knowledge or consent.

Parents, relatives and the community may use relentless pressure and emotional blackmail, threatening behaviour, abduction, imprisonment and physical violence to coerce young people to enter into marriage. While both men and women experience forced marriage, it is a form of violence most commonly perpetrated against women and girls. People have been unable to return to Canada because their passports and money have been withheld by family members.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Somalia.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Somalia by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Somalia to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.
