## Natural disasters and climate

### Cyclones and monsoons

The rainy seasons in the South Pacific extend from November to April. Severe rainstorms can cause flooding and landslides, which can hamper overland, maritime and air travel. They can also reduce the provision of essential services such as water and power.

* Keep informed of regional weather forecasts
* Avoid disaster areas
* Follow the advice of local authorities

During a cyclone or monsoon, hotel guests may be required to leave accommodations near the shore and move to inland safety centres. Travel to and from outer islands may be disrupted for some days.

### Seismic activity

Kiribati is in an active seismic zone. A tsunami can occur within minutes of a nearby earthquake. However, the risk of tsunami can remain for several hours following the first tremor. If you are staying on the coast, familiarize yourself with the regionâ€™s evacuation plans in the event of a tsunami warning.
