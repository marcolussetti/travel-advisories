#### Violent crime

Violent crime occurs, including:

Avoid using unmarked, illegal taxis called “jitneys,” as drivers have committed sexual assaults.

During your stay:

* always be aware of your surroundings
* pay attention to people walking behind you

* avoid walking alone after dark
* do not resist an attack
* stay in accommodations with adequate security measures
* keep doors and windows locked at all times

Crime tends to increase during the holiday season from December to January.

Police response could be long when calling to report a crime. You may need to go to a local police station to accelerate the process. Reporting a crime can be complex and time-consuming.

### Fraud

Cybercrime, malware attacks and online extortion occur.

Criminals can compromise public Wi-Fi networks to steal personal data or credit information.

### Spiked food, drinks and other items

Never leave your food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Avoid accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as these items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations may occur. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Water shortages

The Turks and Caicos Islands experience water shortages. Local authorities may impose water rationing measures.

* Keep a sufficient supply of water on hand
* Monitor local media for the latest information

### Water activities

Sharks pose a risk to swimmers. Do not swim in waters where fishermen use bait to attract marine life.

* Consult residents and tour operators for information on possible hazards, the presence of dangerous species and safe swimming areas
* Keep a safe distance from areas reserved for recreational boating

### Adventure tourism

Outdoor activities, such as diving and snorkelling, can be dangerous.

Tour operators may not meet Canadian safety standards.

If you intend to participate in adventure tourism activities:

* share your itinerary with a friend or family member if you’re alone
* obtain detailed information on your activity and the environment in which you will be setting out
* buy travel insurance that covers incidents related to these types of recreational activities
* refrain from using equipment if you are unsure of its condition or safety

### Boating

Boaters could encounter watercraft operated by armed smugglers. Remain vigilant and only use officially recognized docking and berthing facilities.

* Know and respect the navigation rules
* Make sure you have a good understanding of local regulations
* Ensure you have knowledge of international borders

### Roads

#### Road safety

Road safety may vary considerably across the country.

Fatal accidents are frequent.

At a roundabout, you must yield to cars on your right and those already circling.

Traffic drives on the left, but most cars are right-side drive, making driving more difficult due to reduced visibility.

#### Road conditions

Main roads are generally in good condition, but secondary roads are poorly maintained and dangerous due to:

* potholes
* uneven surfaces
* bad road markings and signages
* insufficient lighting
* livestock
* traffic jams and heavy traffic

#### Driving habits

Drivers often speed and can be reckless. Be prepared for sudden stops.

### Public transportation

There is no public transportation in the Turks and Caicos Islands, but taxis, which are often passenger vans, are readily available. Rates are usually charged per person.

* Only use officially marked taxis
* Confirm the fare in advance

We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.
