# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Crime

Petty crime occurs, including theft from rental vehicles. Muggings and armed assaults also occur, mostly in areas popular with tourists. Be especially vigilant on Providenciales, which has a higher crime rate than the other islands.

* Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Never leave valuables such as money, credit cards and personal electronics unattended, especially on beaches and in vehicles
* Don’t carry large amounts of cash
* Be cautious when using ATMs, especially after dusk
* Avoid secluded, isolated areas, such as roads, parks and beaches, after dark

#### Home break-ins

Armed invasions and assaults at private villas with inadequate security have been a growing concern since 2016. If you’re the victim of an armed robbery, comply with the perpetrator’s demands without resistance to avoid injury and immediately report the incident to local police.

* Stay in busy, reputable and well-protected accommodation
* Keep your doors locked at all times
* Always verify the identity of a visitor before opening the door
* Use the hotel safe for storage of valuables and travel documents

### Spiked food and drinks

Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations may occur. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety vary greatly throughout the country. Main roads are generally in good condition but secondary roads may be narrow and have unpaved surfaces, potholes as well as blind intersections.

Driving can be hazardous on Providenciales due to reckless drivers and excessive speeding. Be prepared for sudden stops. Accidents causing fatalities are increasingly common on the islands.

### Public transportation

There’s no public transportation available in Turks and Caicos Islands but taxis, which areoften transportation vans, are readily available.

* Only use licensed taxis
* Agree on a fare with your driver before beginning your journey

### Adventure tourism

If you plan to explore remote areas of the islands, such as for bird watching, diving or snorkelling, inform friends, relatives or hotel management of your destination, whether you will be accompanied and the time of your expected return.

Undertake excursions in groups and with experienced tour operators.

### Water activities

Coastal waters can be dangerous.

Ensure that beach and aquatic equipment is safe and in good condition, and that helmets and life jackets are available. Rescue services may not be consistent with international standards.
