## Natural disasters and climate

### Rainy season

The rainy season runs from April to November.

Seasonal flooding can slow down overland travel and reduce the delivery of essential services. Roads may become impassable and bridges may be damaged.

* Avoid the affected areas
* Keep informed of regional weather forecasts
* Follow the instructions of local authorities

### Sand dust

The harmattan, a burning, dusty and sand-filled wind, blows in from the Sahara from December to March.

The harmattan can cause disruptions to travel and reduce visibility, especially in the northern parts of the country. It can also strongly affect the health of people with respiratory ailments.

* Consult a physician before departure to determine associated health risks
* Monitor local media for up-to-date information
