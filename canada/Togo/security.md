# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Border with Burkina Faso

Extremist groups operating in southwest Burkina Faso have infiltrated the border with Togo. They have carried out attacks as well as kidnappings.

In response to these incidents, and the extremist threat, the local government has increased military operations in the border region.

Further attacks may occur with little or no warning.

### Savanes Region

The increased presence of extremist groups in the Savanes Region has led to an increased risk of attack and kidnapping. A state of emergency is in effect until March 2025. Foreign travelers making their way to this region are required to obtain written travel authorization issued by the Ministry of Armed Forces of the Togolese Republic.

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs, especially in Lomé. Thieves are more active along beaches and in market areas.

Ensure that your belongings, including your passport, are secure at all times.

#### Violent crime

Violent crime, such as armed assaults, violent robberies and armed carjacking, is increasing and may also occur. Residential burglaries are common. Criminals are active mainly at night but there have also been incidents during the day.

* Remain vigilant at all times
* Don’t show signs of affluence
* Avoid walking alone, especially after dark
* Avoid the beach and the seafront at night
* If you are the victim of an armed attack, don’t resist

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations take place regularly. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

The cities of Sodoké, Bafilo and Mango are particularly prone to civil unrest and violent demonstrations. Clashes between security forces and demonstrators have resulted in casualties in the past. Security forces have used excessive force to disperse crowds and local authorities have shut down telecommunication services in affected areas.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for the latest information

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in western Africa. Terrorist attacks could occur at any time.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

### Fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud occurs. When using debit or credit cards:

* pay careful attention when others are handling your cards
* use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN

### Power outages

Power outages are common in Togo. They may affect tourist facilities, which are already scarce.

### Fuel shortages

Fuel shortages occur occasionally across the country. They may lead to a reduction of essential services and line-ups at gas stations.

* Plan accordingly
* Keep a supply of fuel on hand

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety can vary greatly throughout the country. While city roads are usually paved, you may need a four-wheel-drive vehicle for travel outside major cities. Heavy seasonal rains and flooding can also affect the road conditions.

Most roads are poorly lit with poor signage. Motorcycles, vehicles, pedestrians and roaming animals pose further risks.

In Lomé, criminals frequently lure drivers out of their vehicles by pretending to need assistance. Armed bandits also set up illegal roadblocks to stop and rob vehicles.

If driving in Togo:

* don’t travel overland after dark
* keep vehicle doors locked and windows shut at all times
* carry a cellphone and a charger with you at all times
* if involved in a road accident, contact the police, don’t try to leave the scene as it could draw a crowd that can turn hostile
* in remote areas, travel in a convoy of at least two vehicles

### Public transportation

Public transportation is limited and inadequate. When available, vehicles are poorly maintained and unsafe.

#### Buses

Public and private bus services are unsafe. Vehicles are poorly maintained.

Avoid using them.

#### Taxis

Taxis are available, but vehicles are not properly maintained.

* Use officially marked taxis only
* Don’t share taxis with strangers

#### Motorcycles and mopeds

Motorcycles and mopeds commonly operate as taxis, especially in Lomé. Drivers are often speeding.

Be cautious if using them as accidents occur.

### Swimming

Coastal waters can be dangerous due to strong currents.

* Consult local residents for information on possible hazards and safe swimming areas
* Follow the instructions and warnings of local authorities
