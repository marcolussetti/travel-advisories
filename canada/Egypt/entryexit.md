# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

The authorities of a country or territory decide who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Egyptian authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond the date you expect to leave Egypt.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

Diplomatic and Special passport holders are required to have visas before arrival in Egypt.

Travellers attempting to enter Egypt with diplomatic or official passports who do not have visas will be required to remain, at their own expense, in the airport transit area until their immediate departure from Egypt can be arranged. The Embassy of Canada in Egypt cannot intervene in such matters.

### Gender expression and entry procedures

You may be denied entry or subject to invasive search and screening if your gender expression or physical appearance does not match the gender identifier in your passport or your passport photograph.

### Visas

Tourist visa: required  
Business visa: required  
Student visa: required

Canadian passport holders can obtain an electronic visa prior to travel or upon arrival in Egypt.

If you wish to extend your stay in Egypt, contact the Immigration Authority of Egypt. You may be fined upon departure if you overstay your 30-day visa period without proper authorization.

### Entry and exit stamps

You must show proof of an entry stamp in your passport when you leave Egypt. If you cannot provide proof of entry, you cannot obtain an exit stamp and will be denied exit.

If you have entered the country with a Canadian passport and have obtained a new one while in Egypt, you must have the entry stamp transferred to the new passport by the Egyptian Immigration Authority. This requirement also applies to newborns and dual citizens.

If a child is born in Egypt to a Canadian parent, a data stamp proving that the child was born in Egypt must be added to the child's Canadian passport before the child can exit the country. Since there will be no entry stamp in the child's passport, you must submit both the child's birth certificate and Canadian passport to the Egyptian Immigration Authority to obtain what Egyptian authorities term the “data stamp.” Parents are advised to contact the Embassy of Canada as soon as possible to apply for citizenship and a passport for their child, so as not to further delay what can be a lengthy process.

### Regional travel

If you are contemplating onward travel to other Arab countries, bear in mind that Canadians have been denied entry because their passports bore an Israeli visa, an Israeli border stamp or an Egyptian or Jordanian border stamp issued by an office bordering Israel, which would indicate they entered from Israel.

### Israeli border

Due to the ongoing events in Israel, West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the land borders could close with little notice.

The Rafah border crossing to the Gaza Strip has been closed since May 2024. The Government of Canada continues to advise against all travel to the Gaza Strip due to ongoing military operations.

The Taba border crossing to southern Israel remains open.

### Medication and cosmetics

Egyptian authorities consider some prescription and over-the-counter medicines medications controlled substances. They will seize all narcotic and psychotropic medications, even if you have the original prescription. For all other prescription and over-the-counter medications:

* Carry the original prescription
* Ensure the medication is in its original packaging
* Don't attempt to enter with more than 3 months' supply.

Authorities also regulate the import of cosmetics and veterinary products.

### Health entry requirements

All foreigners planning to study, work or train in Egypt for longer than one month may be required to undergo testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Egyptian immigration authorities in Cairo's Mogamma building provide information on this procedure upon application.

When entering from another country you may be required to provide proof of immunizations. Please verify with the Egyptian Embassy nearest to you before travelling.
