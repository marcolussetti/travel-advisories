* Exercise caution, particularly in areas around rivers

### Sand and dust storms

Sand storms and dust storms can occur in the spring. Sand-laden winds can blow at high speeds, creating difficult driving conditions. Poor visibility can also affect flights. These storms can cause respiratory problems, which can be fatal for some individuals.

During a storm:

* stay indoors
* keep windows closed
* follow the instructions of local authorities
* monitor local media for the latest information
