You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Driving

You should carry an international driving permit.

### Drugs

The use of drugs and open consumption of alcohol (other than in licensed facilities such as hotels and restaurants) are prohibited. Transgressions could be punished by detention or other penalties.

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are strict. Convicted offenders can expect jail sentences and heavy fines. Capital punishment is a sentencing option for certain drug-related crimes.

### Demonstrations

Local law prohibits protests without a permit.

Being near anti-government protests may subject you to scrutiny from Egyptian police and security forces.

### Drones

Drones are strictly prohibited in Egypt; anyone convicted of unauthorized import or use of drone technology could be subject to lengthy jail terms and deportation. Unauthorized possession and usage of drones in Egypt may carry similar charges to espionage.

### Electronic devices

Egyptian officials will likely confiscate electronic devices upon entry if you did not obtain prior approval to import them. This includes:

* large video cameras
* filming equipment
* satellite phones
* radios
* certain equipment like binoculars

You may face interrogation on the intended use of your devices due to their potential use for military and surveillance purposes.

Contact the nearest Embassy of the Arab Republic of Egypt for further information on regulations and requirements on electronic devices.

### Photography

Photography of bridges, canals (including the Suez Canal), government, police and embassy buildings and vehicles, as well as military personnel and establishments is prohibited.

### Social media

Publishing or posting social media or other content that could be perceived as critical of Egyptian society, government, security forces or the President may be considered illegal under Egyptian law. Convictions can carry heavy fines and lengthy prison sentences. There is a high risk of arrest in connection to social media posts considered critical of Egypt.

### Behaviour

Due to the current security context and political sensitivities, be conscious of your behaviour and how it may be interpreted by Egyptian authorities. Visitors including researchers, journalists, activists and development workers could encounter problems with authorities, if their activities are perceived as suspicious. Meeting with members of or expressing support for organizations banned in Egypt could be perceived as criminal behaviour.

Suspects may be detained without charges or access to immediate legal counsel during investigative stages of a criminal case.

### Customs

Strict duties apply on the importation of expensive electronics, including video and photographic equipment, laptops, and computer software and hardware. Such equipment should be for personal use and you should list it (model and serial number) and check it upon arrival and departure, in which case no duty will be collected. Appropriate permits and authorizations are required for the commercial importation of any type of electronics.

It is prohibited to export any antiquity or any item older than 100 years without a licence. Contact the Embassy of the Arab Republic of Egypt in Ottawa for further information regarding customs requirements.

### Money

The currency is the Egyptian pound (EGP, E£).

A maximum of E£5,000 can be brought into or taken out of Egypt. You must declare any amount of currency equivalent to US$10,000 or more.

Traveller’s cheques and foreign currency are easily exchanged in hotels and banks. U.S. dollars are preferred, particularly at tourist sites. Some travel agents and tour operators request payment in U.S. cash only.

Major credit cards are accepted in larger stores and for larger purchases, but many merchants will only accept cash or may charge a fee for payment by credit card.

### Forced marriages

There are reports of Canadian citizens being forced into marriage without their prior knowledge or consent.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Egypt.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Egypt, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

[Dual citizens](http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/documents/dual-citizenship)

The Egyptian government considers Canadians who also hold Egyptian citizenship to be Egyptian while in Egypt, therefore our ability to offer consular services may be limited. You may be considered an Egyptian citizen if you were born to an Egyptian father, regardless of birth place.

Egyptian-Canadian men may be subject to military service when in Egypt. In order to be exempted, dual citizens are required to present many documents before leaving Egypt, including a document of discharge due to dual citizenship. This document does not necessarily provide an exemption, and obtaining it may be a lengthy process that could affect your departure date. The Government of Canada has no jurisdiction in the process, as the decision on military service rests solely with the Egyptian government. You should contact the Egyptian embassy or consulate in Canada before travelling.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Egypt.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Egypt by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Egypt to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Culture

The work week is Sunday through Thursday. Egypt’s customs, laws and regulations adhere closely to Islamic practices and beliefs. Exercise common sense and discretion in dress and behaviour.

Dress conservatively: for women, knee-length or longer dresses and long sleeves are preferable, and men should not wear shorts outside tourist areas. Respect religious and social traditions to avoid offending local sensitivities. Overt public displays of intimate affection are frowned upon in Egyptian culture.

In 2026, the lunar month of Ramadan is expected to begin on or around February 17.

In public, between sunrise and sunset, be discreet when:

* drinking
* eating
* smoking

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Egyptian laws doesn’t criminalize sexual acts or relationships between persons of the same sex.

However, 2SLGBTQI+ travellers could be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression or sex characteristics.

You could be arrested for indecent exposure, public nuisance or scandalous acts.

The Egyptian police target apps and websites popular within the 2SLGBTQI+ community. They have used fake and legitimate accounts from community members who had their phones confiscated. Assaults and arrests by the police have occurred as a result of encounters set up through dating apps.

2SLGBTQI+  travellers should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Egypt.
