### Dress and behaviour

To avoid offending local sensitivities:

* dress conservatively
* avoid kissing in public
* behave discreetly
* respect religious and social traditions

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Zambia. However, if local authorities consider you a citizen of Zambia, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services, which would limit our ability to assist you.

Using your valid Canadian passport and presenting yourself as Canadian to foreign authorities at all times minimize this risk. You may however need to carry and present a Zambian passport for legal reasons, for example to enter and exit the country. Citizenship is determined solely by national laws, and the decision to recognize dual citizenship rests completely with the country in which you are located when seeking consular assistance.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Zambia.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Zambia by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Zambia to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.
