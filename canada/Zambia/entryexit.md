# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

The authorities of a country or territory decide who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Zambian authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond the date you expect to leave Zambia and should have at least 3 blank pages.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with a “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

You should also be aware that current systems used by some countries and travel companies may not recognize the “X” gender identifier. You may still be asked to provide your sex/gender information as either male or female when travelling.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Visas

Tourist visa: not required for stays up to 90 days per calendar year  
 Business visa: not required for stays up to 30 days per calendar year  
 Student visa: not required for stays up to 30 days per calendar year  
 Volunteer visa: not required for stays up to 30 days per calendar year

Check that the authorised number of days stamped in your passport on arrival matches the length of your intended stay. While Canadian tourists are eligible for up to 90 days, immigration officials may only grant 30 days.

To stay in Zambia beyond your authorised period, apply for an extension at a Zambian immigration office or through Zambia’s e-service platform. Overstaying can result in fines, arrest, imprisonment or deportation.

The KAZA UNIVISA is a shared tourist visa between Zambia and Zimbabwe to simplify cross-border travel between the two countries in the Kavango Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Areas. It also allows day trips to Botswana. You can apply online through Zambia’s e-service platform or in person at the following locations:

* Kenet Kaunda and Harry Mwanga Nkumbula International Airport
* Victoria Falls and Kazungula land border crossings

### Departure tax

Foreigners are required to pay a departure tax before leaving Zambia, which is usually included in the cost of international flight tickets. For domestic flights, passengers must pay a small fee in kwacha (local currency) before entering the departure hall.
