## Natural disasters and climate

### Climate change

Climate change is affecting Zambia. Extreme and unusual weather events are becoming more frequent and may affect your travel plans.

### Rainy season

The rainy season usually extends from December to April. Seasonal flooding can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services. Rural roads may become impassable due to mudslides and landslides. Bridges, buildings, and infrastructure may be damaged.

* Monitor local media for the latest updates, including those on road conditions
* Stay away from flooded areas
* Monitor weather reports
* Follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders

### Drought

The dry season usually lasts from May to October but has become more severe and longer in recent years. Drought has caused widespread crop failure, accelerated desertification and lowered water levels. Given the country's reliance on hydropower, this has led to prolonged electricity shortages. Local authorities can impose restrictions on water use, with fines for non-compliance.
