## Safety and security

### Contamination of Kafue River

In February 2025, a large volume of contaminated mining wastewater was discharged into the Mwambashi Stream, which flows into the Kafue River.

The spill introduced high levels of pollutants, including chemicals and heavy metals, into the water. This has caused severe environmental damage and poses serious risks to public health.

You should avoid the affected area.

If you must travel to the affected area:

* follow local public health and environmental guidance regarding water safety and food
* only use water that is known to be safe for drinking, bathing, or cooking. Boiling water doesn’t remove heavy metals
* don’t eat fish that may have been caught in or passed through the affected area. Check local fish advisories for the latest food safety information
* talk to your health care provider if you're worried about any symptoms you may have

### Areas bordering Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique

Despite Zambia being declared a landmine-free country in 2009, there may still be landmines and unexploded ordinance in areas bordering Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Mozambique.

If you are travelling to any of these areas:

* stay on main roads and paved surfaces
* avoid roadside ditches, shoulders and unmarked trails
* cross only at official border crossings
* strictly observe warning signs indicating the possible presence of landmines

Trans-border criminal activity between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia has resulted in an increase in crime on the Zambian side of the border. Be vigilant in all border areas.

### Crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs.

Theft is common throughout Zambia. Be particularly vigilant in:

### Spiked food and drinks

The use of “date rape drugs” at bars, restaurants and nightclubs occurs in Lusaka. Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

### Roads

#### Road safety

There are major road safety issues in Zambia. Fatal accidents are common, especially on the Great East Road, the Great North Road and Kafue Road. Pedestrians are often involved. Police and emergency services assistance is limited or even unavailable in rural areas. There are no ambulances to assist in the event of a road accident.

#### Road conditions

Road conditions vary throughout the country and at different times of the year. Main roads are generally well maintained, while secondary roads can be in poor condition and dangerous. During the rainy season, from December to April, road conditions deteriorate significantly, and driving can become dangerous.

Driving can be dangerous due to:

* poorly maintained vehicles
* pedestrians on the road
* potholes
* stray animals
* insufficient lighting and vehicles not using their headlights

#### Driving habits

Drivers don’t always respect traffic laws and speeding is common. Priority is not given to pedestrians or other drivers. Drinking and driving is common.

If you choose to drive in Zambia:

* always drive defensively
* always keep doors and windows closed and locked
* never leave personal belongings unattended in a vehicle, even in the trunk
* consider using a four-wheel drive vehicle during the rainy season
* ask about insurance coverage options for roadside assistance when you rent a vehicle

#### Checkpoints

Police checkpoints are common throughout the country, particularly outside cities. Only national police officers have the authority to establish checkpoints.

* Be prepared to show your identification
* Follow the instructions of the police
* Remain calm and courteous

If you are asked to pay a fine on the spot for traffic violation, ask for a copy of the written fine that can be paid later, or insist on going to the nearest police station.

### National parks and nature reserves

Many national parks and nature reserves are in remote areas with limited emergency services. Wild animals often venture within boundaries of camps.

If you decide to visit parks and reserves:

* only use reputable and professional guides or tour operators
* follow the advice and warnings of local tour guides and camp employees
* avoid swimming in lakes and rivers due to the presence of dangerous animals or health risks (schistosomiasis LINK to the schistosomiasis section in the health tab)
* do not walk around at night
* never leave children unattended

### Wildlife observation

Wild animals can be dangerous, particularly if you are on foot or at close range.

* Always maintain a safe distance when observing wildlife
* Only exit a vehicle when a professional guide or warden says it’s safe to do so
* Closely follow park regulations and wardens’ advice

### Water shortages and power outages

Water shortages and power outages occur regularly in Zambia and are worsened by severe droughts that have become more frequent in recent years. The droughts have significantly reduced water levels affecting the country’s hydroelectric production, leading to nationwide water rationing measures and power outages.

Power outages can affect the following services and businesses:

* public lighting and traffic lights
* telecommunications and security systems
* stores and food supply
* hotels and other accommodations
* banks and ATMs

If you are in Zambia:

* keep a supply of water, food and fuel on hand
* be prepared for prolonged power outages
* make sure you always have a complete emergency kit on hand, including several flashlights
* always carry a cell phone, power banks, chargers and keep a list of emergency numbers handy

### Fraud

#### Cybercrime

Criminals can compromise public Wi-Fi networks in order to steal personal data or credit information.

Romance scams through dating sites and/or social media have occurred.

* Use secure public Wi-Fi networks
* Be cautious when posting information or photos on social media
* Beware of people who show a keen interest in you online
* Keep in mind that you may be the victim of a scam if you go to Zambia to meet an online acquaintance in person
* Be wary of unsolicited emails offering attractive business opportunities

#### Credit card and ATM fraud

Credit and debit card as well as ATM fraud occurs in Zambia.

When using your debit or credit card:

* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN

### Travelling in remote areas

Tourism infrastructure, including hotels, restaurants and transportation networks, is limited outside the major cities and well-known parks.

If you are planning to travel to remote areas:

* avoid travelling after dark
* keep a supply of water, food, fuel and an emergency kit on hand
* bring a reliable means of communication, such as a cellular telephone (in areas with reliable service), a satellite telephone or a VHF radio
* use a reputable tour operator

### Public transportation

#### Buses

Minibuses are unsafe, poorly maintained, overcrowded and frequently involved in accidents, some of which are fatal. Their drivers do not always respect traffic laws.

Intercity buses operated by reputable companies are usually safer.

#### Taxis and ridesharing services

Taxis availability may be limited outside city centers. Fares are expensive and should be paid in local currency.

* Use only licensed taxis selected by a reputable hotel or restaurant, or from an official taxi stand
* Never share a taxi with strangers
* Make sure the driver doesn’t pick up other passengers along the way to your destination
* Always ask for identification before accepting transportation, and check that the driver’s ID matches the name of the car registration and taxi license
* Ask the driver to start the meter or negotiate the fare in advance
* Have small bills ready for payment

Rideshare services are available in Lusaka and some major cities.

* Use a trusted ridesharing app
* Confirm the driver’s identity and the license plate before getting in the car
* Don't share your ride with a stranger
