### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Ghana.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Ghana by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Ghana to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Money

The currency of Ghana is the Ghanaian cedi (GHS).

There are no restrictions on the import and export of foreign currencies.  They must be declared upon arrival and exchanged for local currency at banks or foreign exchange bureaus only.

Upon arrival, you will receive an Exchange Control Form T-5. If not, you should request it. You must record foreign currency and all transactions made while in the country on this form.  The T-5 declaration form must show that the money obtained while in Ghana were from an authorized dealer in foreign exchange. Currency transactions with private citizens are illegal. Keep the form in a safe place to avoid trouble upon departure.

The export of cedis is prohibited. Before departure, you must spend unused cedis or reconvert them into foreign currency.
