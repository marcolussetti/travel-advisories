# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Border areas

Border areas often see higher criminal activity and violence.

Inter-communal violence related to the Bawku chieftaincy conflict is increasingly affecting northern parts of Ghana. While the country has not been targeted by extremist attacks, these flare ups could present opportunities for violent extremist groups based in Burkina Faso, as well as criminals, to expand their activities across Ghana’s northern borders.

### Inter-ethnic violence

Chieftaincy disputes and political tension can sometimes lead to localized violence and unrest.

While possible throughout Ghana, these conflicts most commonly occur in the Upper East, Upper West and Volta regions.

During times of unrest, local authorities may impose curfews.

If you're travelling to an area where unrest is possible or if unrest breaks out where you are:

* monitor local media to stay up to date on the current situation
* follow the instructions of local authorities
* adhere to curfews

### Crime

Crime has steadily increased in the recent years in Ghana, especially in large cities such as Accra, Kumasi, Takoradi and their surroundings.

#### In Accra

Several violent incidents have occurred in the following Greater Accra neighbourhoods:

* Agbogbloshie
* Ashaiman
* Avenor
* Nima
* Sowutuom
* Sukura

Avoid going into these neighbourhoods at night.

#### Violent crime

Violent crime, such as armed robbery, home invasions and kidnapping, occurs. Thieves often target affluent areas where foreigners live. They sometimes carry firearms. In some cases, they have seriously assaulted their victims for failing to comply.

Armed robberies of vehicles at night also occur and armed attacks have been reported along the Accra–Tema and Accra–Kumasi–Tamale highways.

* Ensure that windows and doors in your residence are secured
* If you are the victim of an armed robbery, don’t resist
* Limit intercity travel to daytime hours

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, is common at crowded markets, beaches, parks and other tourist areas. Attacks by individuals on motorbikes are also frequent.

Theft of luggage and belongings occurs in hotels.

* Ensure that personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Be aware of your surroundings and avoid walking alone
* Avoid going to isolated beaches
* Avoid showing signs of affluence, such as flashy jewellery and watches

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism.Terrorist attacks could occur at any time. Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

2SLGBTQI+ persons and their allies have been victims of violence and discrimination.

Ghanaian law prohibits sexual acts between individuals of the same sex. Those convicted can face up to 25 years in prison.

Even though there are few convictions, 2SLGBTQI+ persons have been arrested and victims of extortion and discrimination based on their identity and sexual orientation.

Since the anti-LGBTI bill was introduced in August 2021, there is an increased risk of violence and discrimination against 2SLGBTQI+ persons and their allies.

2SLGBTQI+ travellers should:

* carefully consider the risks of travelling to Ghana
* be cautious and avoid public displays of affection with someone of the same sex

#### Scams

##### **At the airport**

At the Kotoka International Airport, thieves sometimes pose as uniformed porters or officials appearing to work at the airport. Official airport employees wear ID cards bearing both their name and photograph.

Be wary of unsolicited assistance

##### **On the road**

On the road, scammers may pose as police officers to stop and demand money from foreigners.

If this occurs:

* don’t hand over your money or your passport
* ask for their name tag and Identification number

##### **Tourism industry**

Local tour operators or hotels may offer you steep discounts for their services. They could be fake businesses.

* Do your research before booking
* Use reliable internationally known tourism agencies only

If you have lost money to such scams:

* don’t attempt to confront your scammers
* seek assistance from local authorities or local legal aid

##### **Online scams**

Be wary of Internet romance or friendship scams via dating or social media websites. Scammers often use fake profiles to target Westerners and steal from them. Once they succeed in building a virtual relationship, they ask for money for various purposes.

If you are travelling to Ghana to meet someone you met online, keep in mind that you may be the victim of a scam.  Victims of this type of scams have lost thousands of dollars.

Be also wary of unsolicited emails offering enticing business or financial opportunities, often related to the gold industry.

If you intend to make business in Ghana:

* ensure that any business opportunity is legitimate before leaving; if in doubt, contact Canada’s Trade Commissioner Service
* don’t travel to Ghana with the intention to obtain restitution after losing money to a fraud as confrontations have resulted in assaults

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety can vary greatly throughout the country. They are generally good in cities, but poor in rural areas.  Most secondary roads are poorly lit. Pedestrians and roaming livestock pose further hazard, especially at night.

Many Ghanaian cars, especially commercial vehicles, are in poor condition and lack standard safety equipment. Drivers often don’t respect traffic laws. Accidents causing fatalities are common. Most often, victims are pedestrians. Traffic accidents are also common on the road from Accra to Cape Coast and Kumasi.

In town, people may try to get you to stop your vehicle. Pedestrians may bang on your car, making it appear as if they have been hit. Drivers may attempt to cause minor vehicle collisions. Crowds gathering because of these types of incidents can become dangerous.

Police roadblocks are common. You could be subject to inspections. Armed security forces may demand money.

If driving in Ghana:

* avoid driving after dark
* keep your doors locked and windows closed at all times
* proceed immediately to the nearest police station to make a report if you are involved in any traffic incident
* always carry a copy of you ID documents, such as your passport, your International Driving Permit and the vehicle registration

### Public transportation

Public transportation is unregulated and unsafe. Many buses and taxis are not well-maintained and have poor safety standards.

#### Taxis

Most taxis are in poor mechanical shape in Accra. They often lack seatbelts and most of the time, air conditioning is not functional.

Criminals often target foreigners travelling in taxis at night and violent robberies are frequent.

If you have to use a taxi in Ghana:

* avoid hailing taxis on the street
* use only officially marked taxis
* ensure that there is no other passenger in the car
* limit trips to daytime
* always agree on a fare before departure

If you use a trusted ride-sharing app:

* confirm the driver’s identity before getting in the car
* be aware that the driver might only accept cash payment

#### Minibuses

Privately owned minibuses, known as tro-tros, have a high accident record.  They are often overcrowded and poorly maintained. Drivers are reckless and drive at excessive speeds.

Private intercity buses are available and they are often better maintained and safer.

### Shortages

Periodic shortages of electricity and running water can occur, particularly during the dry season, from November to March, although the situation is improving, especially in Greater Accra.

### Wildlife viewing

Wildlife viewing poses risks, particularly on foot or at close range.

* Always maintain a safe distance when observing wildlife
* Only exit a vehicle when a professional guide or warden says it’s safe to do so
* Only use reputable and professional guides or tour operators
* Closely follow park regulations and wardens’ advice

### Swimming

Coastal waters can be dangerous. Riptides are common. Several drownings occur each year.

Follow the instructions and warnings of local authorities.
