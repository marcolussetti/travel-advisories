### Heavy rains

Although Saudi Arabia is one of the driest countries in the world, heavy rains occur occasionally between the months of November and February and can cause major flooding. This can severely affect overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services.

* Exercise caution
* Monitor local news and weather reports
* Follow the advice of local authorities

### Sand storms

The weather is very dry and hot from May to October. Sand storms and dust storms may occur during the summer months.

Shamals, sand-laden winds from the northern deserts, occur most frequently in early summer and can blow at significant speeds for days, creating difficult driving conditions. These storms can also cause respiratory problems, which can be fatal for some people.

If a dust storm is occurring:

* stay indoors
* keep windows closed
* be prepared to change your travel plans on short notice, including cutting short or cancelling your trip
* monitor local media for up-to-date information on the situation
