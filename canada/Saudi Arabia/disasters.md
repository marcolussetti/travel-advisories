### Heavy rains

Although Saudi Arabia is one of the driest countries in the world, heavy rains occur occasionally between November and February and can cause major flooding. This can severely affect overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services.

* Exercise caution
* Monitor local media for the latest information
* Follow the advice of local authorities

### Sandstorms and dust storms

The weather is very dry and hot from May to October. Sandstorms and dust storms are common in Saudi Arabia and usually occur during the summer months, especially in central and eastern provinces.

The shamal, a sand-laden wind from the northern deserts, occurs most frequently in early summer and can blow at significant speeds for days, creating difficult driving conditions. These storms can also cause respiratory problems, which can be fatal for some people.

If a sandstorm or a dust storm occurs:

* stay indoors
* keep your doors and windows closed
* be prepared to change your travel plans on short notice, including cutting short or cancelling your trip
* monitor local media for the latest information

### Air quality

Air quality in Saudi Arabia varies by region and season and can reach unhealthy levels, particularly in urban areas and during sandstorms and dust storms.

During periods of bad air quality:

* limit your outdoor activities
* monitor air quality levels
* keep your doors and windows closed
* follow the instructions of local authorities
