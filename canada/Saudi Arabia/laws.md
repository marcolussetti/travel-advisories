## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Legal process

The Saudi judicial system is based on Sharia (Islamic law). The legal process may be slow and cumbersome. Those suspected of, and witnesses to offences may be held for lengthy periods without access to legal counsel or consular officials. If access is granted, it may be severely limited by Saudi authorities. Seek legal advice as soon as possible.

Authorities may place a legal travel ban on individuals involved in ongoing legal cases or investigations, or who have outstanding debts. Saudi citizens are also permitted to place travel bans on individuals.

### Drugs and alcohol

Penalties for the import, manufacture, possession and consumption of alcohol,  illegal drugs or products containing their ingredients are severe.

Saudi authorities practice zero tolerance and make no distinction between alcohol and soft or hard drugs. Drug offenders may be sentenced to corporeal punishment or death.

### Religious proselytism

It's illegal to:

* engage in religious proselytizing
* criticize Islam
* practise any religion other than Islam in public spaces

Be cautious when discussing religious issues.

### Ramadan

In 2025, the lunar month of Ramadan is expected to begin on or around February 28.

In public, between sunrise and sunset, refrain from:

* drinking
* eating
* smoking

### Behaviour in public and on social media

Saudi law prohibits:

* criticizing the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the royal family, its institutions and Islam
* provoking, mocking or questioning public order, religious values, and public morals
* expressing support for any banned groups or organizations considered by Saudi authorities to practice violence.

These prohibitions extend to your online activity, including what you post, share or like on social media.

If the Saudi authorities accuse you of such an offence or place you under investigation, you could face a travel ban until the conclusion of the proceedings, which could last several months or years.

Foreign nationals have been convicted and sentenced to lengthy jail sentences for social media activities, including some that took place abroad and several years ago, such as posts or "likes".

### Dress and behaviour

The country’s customs, laws and regulations adhere to Islamic practices and beliefs. Dress conservatively, behave discreetly and respect religious and social traditions in order to avoid offending local sensitivities, especially in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, and in mosques.

#### Dress code

Women should observe the strict Saudi dress code and wear conservative and loose-fitting clothes, including a full-length cloak (abaya) and a head scarf. Men should not wear shorts in public or go without a shirt. Seek guidance concerning acceptable clothing before your arrival.

#### Public spaces

Avoid physical contact, such as holding hands, in public.

Women aren’t allowed to associate with men in public unless the women are accompanied by other family members. A woman can be charged with prostitution if she’s found associating with a man who is not a relative.

Restaurants can have two sections: one for men only, and the family section where families, accompanied females and unaccompanied females are served.

### Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice

The Mutawa, also known as the religious police, have harassed, pursued and assaulted foreigners they believe disregard strict Saudi standards of conduct and dress. Often, they will simply instruct women to cover their hair. The Mutawa carry special identification and are typically accompanied by a uniformed police officer.

* If you’re stopped by the Mutawa, cooperate and ask them for their credentials. Offer to accompany them to the nearest police station
* Don’t hand over identification documents
* Inform your sponsors if the police retain your documents

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Saudi law criminalises sexual acts and relationships between persons of the same sex.

Convicted 2SLGBTQI+ persons face:

* jail sentences
* corporal punishments
* the death penalty

Transgender people and cross-dressers face the same consequences as those convicted of homosexuality.

Public or online discussions related to sexual orientation or gender identity could be considered by Saudi authorities as provoking or questioning public order, religious values, and public morals.

2SLGBTQI+ persons should take into consideration the risks of travelling to Saudi Arabia.

* Carry identification documents, including your residency permit (iqama) or entry visa, at all times
* Leave your passport in a safe place and carry a photocopy for identification purposes

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Saudi Arabia.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of Saudi Arabia, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

### Marriage between a foreign woman and a Saudi man

A Saudi man who wishes to marry a foreign woman must obtain permission from Saudi authorities. He must also sign a document that gives irrevocable permission to his wife and the children born of their union to enter and exit the country without restrictions. This law has been in effect since 2008, and is not retroactive. Regardless, the foreign spouse and their children may still have difficulty leaving Saudi Arabia.

#### Common-law unions

Common-law relationships are illegal and are subject to severe punishment, including the death penalty.

#### Extramarital relations

Extramartial relations are illegal and subject to severe punishment, including the death penalty.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Saudi Arabia.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Saudi Arabia by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Saudi Arabia to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.
