## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Legal process

Saudi Arabia’s judicial system is based on Sharia (Islamic law). Legal proceedings can be slow, complex, and may lack the transparency typically expected in Canada. Individuals suspected of a crime, or even witnesses, can be detained for extended periods without access to legal counsel or consular support. When access is granted, it may be limited and at the discretion of Saudi authorities. It is important to seek legal assistance as early as possible.

Authorities may impose exit bans on individuals involved in legal proceedings or investigations, or those with unpaid debts. In some cases, Saudi citizens can also request exit bans against others.

### Drugs and alcohol

Penalties for the importation, manufacturing, possession and consumption of alcohol, illegal narcotics and drugs (including cannabis) or products containing their ingredients are severe.

Saudi authorities practice zero tolerance and make no distinction between alcohol and soft or hard drugs. Your bags will be screened on arrival. Drug offenders may be sentenced to corporal punishment or death.

### Religious proselytism

It's illegal to:

* engage in religious proselytizing
* criticize Islam
* practise any religion other than Islam in public spaces

Be cautious when discussing religious issues.

### Ramadan

In 2026, the lunar month of Ramadan is expected to begin on or around February 17.

In public, between sunrise and sunset, be discreet when:

* drinking
* eating
* smoking

### Dress and behaviour

Saudi Arabia’s customs, laws, and regulations closely adhere to Islamic practices and beliefs. You should dress conservatively, behave discreetly, and respect religious and social traditions to avoid offending local sensitivities, especially in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina and in mosques.

Both men and women should dress modestly in public, avoiding tight-fitting clothing or items with language or images that may be considered culturally offensive. Shoulders and knees should be covered. Women who don’t adhere to local dress standards may attract unwanted attention.

In Saudi Arabia, cultural norms and the Public Decorum Charter encourage modest dress. Women are generally expected to cover their arms and legs. Clothing with profanity, offensive images, or symbols promoting racism, drugs or obscenity is prohibited in public.

### Public spaces

Avoid public displays of affection, such as holding hands.

Some restaurants have sections for men only and one for families where females can be served, including when unaccompanied.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Saudi law criminalizes sexual acts and relationships between persons of the same sex.

Convicted 2SLGBTQI+ persons face:

* heavy fines
* jail sentences
* corporal punishments
* deportation
* the death penalty

2SLGBTQI+ persons could be detained based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or sex characteristics. They could also face charges such as:

* cross dressing
* gross indecency
* offence to public morals

Transgender people and cross-dressers face the same consequences as those convicted of homosexuality.

Public or online discussions related to sexual orientation or gender identity could be considered by Saudi authorities as provoking or questioning public order, religious values, and public morals.

2SLGBTQI+ persons should take into consideration the risks of travelling to Saudi Arabia.

### Identification

Local authorities may ask you to show identification at any time.

* Carry identification documents, including your residency permit (iqama) or entry visa, at all times
* Leave your passport in a safe place and carry a photocopy for identification purposes

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Saudi Arabia.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of Saudi Arabia, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

### Common-law relationships

If you wish to reside in Saudi Arabia and are in a common-law relationship, you will be required to provide proof of marriage to register in the country.

### Extramarital relations

Extramarital relations are illegal and subject to severe punishment, including the death penalty.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Saudi Arabia.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Saudi Arabia by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Saudi Arabia to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.
