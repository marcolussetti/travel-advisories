## Safety and security

### Tensions in the Middle East

The security situation remains unpredictable and could deteriorate significantly with little or no warning.

This may result in travel disruptions, including flight cancellations and airspace closures.

You should:

* monitor local and international media to stay informed of the rapidly evolving situation
* be vigilant and follow the instructions of local authorities at all times
* Register or update your contact information with the [Registration of Canadians Abroad](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/registration "https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/registration") service to receive the latest information from the Government of Canada

### Behaviour in public and on social media

Saudi law prohibits:

* criticizing the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the royal family, its institutions, and Islam
* provoking, mocking or questioning public order, religious values, and public morals
* expressing support for any banned groups or organizations considered by Saudi authorities to practice violence

These prohibitions extend to your online activity, including what you post, share or like on social media.

If the Saudi authorities accuse you of such an offence or place you under investigation, you could face a travel ban until the conclusion of the proceedings, which could last several months or years. The legal processes around national security cases can be complex and slow.

Saudi nationals and foreigners have been sentenced to lengthy jail sentences for social media activities, including posts or simple “likes”. This included social media activity that took place outside Saudi Arabia and sometimes many years in the past.

### Borders

#### Border with Yemen

Between 2015 and 2022, missiles, drones and other projectiles were used by terrorists in Yemen and the international coalition conducting strikes on terrorist-controlled areas in Yemen, including near the border with Saudi Arabia.

During that period, terrorist attacks also targeted cities in Saudi Arabia, civilian infrastructure, airports, military bases and energy facilities. Military debris from interceptions also posed a security risk. A 2022 U.N.-brokered truce ended cross-border strikes from Yemen, but the terrorist group responsible for the attacks has threatened to resume strikes on Saudi Arabia.

Saudi border authorities regularly patrol along the border with Yemen to dismantle criminal networks involved in human, narcotics and arms trafficking. Security operations near the border periodically lead to violent spillovers, including clashes with Saudi authorities.

Due to the ongoing conflicts and instability along the border, airports in the area may be closed with little or no notice. Verify your travel plans before leaving for the airport.

Exercise extreme caution if you are travelling to or within other parts of southwestern Saudi Arabia.

#### Northern Saudi border

Saudi authorities have declared “out of bounds” zones within 20 km of:

* the border with Iraq
* the towns of Hafr al Batin and Khafji in Eastern Province

If you enter these zones without proper authorization, even inadvertently, you face severe penalties, including imprisonment and fines.

You should only cross the border at designated and official land border crossing points, which are clearly identified.

### Governorate of Al Qatif

In the past, sectarian tensions led to violent clashes between Saudi security forces and Shia militant groups, especially around the cities of Al Awamiyah and Al Musawara. While there have been no major security incidents since 2020, tensions persist and security forces maintain a heightened presence.

### Missile strikes and drones

Missiles and drones launched by terrorist entities in Yemen toward Israel often transit Saudi airspace. Most of these have been intercepted and destroyed, but the projectiles and military debris pose a risk in Saudi Arabia, the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. Although a UN-brokered truce was announced in 2022, drone attacks launched from Yemen may still occur near the Saudi border. Previous attacks have targeted Riyadh, Abha, Yanbu and parts of Eastern Province. The possibility of further attacks from Yemen on cities and infrastructure in Saudi Arabia cannot be ruled out.

If you encounter debris or fragments:

* move away from them immediately
* contact local authorities

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism throughout the country.

Saudi authorities conduct counter-terrorism operations and have heightened security measures, but attacks cannot be ruled out. Terrorists have targeted Saudi and foreign interests, such as government buildings, military installations, energy facilities and diplomatic missions.

Targets could also include:

* schools, including universities
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

Be particularly vigilant during:

* sporting events
* religious holidays
* public celebrations

Terrorists have used such occasions to mount attacks.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations are illegal and therefore rare in Saudi Arabia. In the past, demonstrations and civil unrest occurred in predominantly Shia communities in the Al Qatif governorate of Eastern Province, due to longstanding sectarian tensions. In Saudi Arabia, security forces react quickly to prevent demonstrations from forming or gathering momentum. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Hajj

The next Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca is expected to take place from May 24 to 29, 2026. Traffic in Mecca peaks during Eid al-Adha, which occurs during Hajj.

#### Religious sites during Hajj

There are safety risks at religious sites due to overcrowding. Pilgrims have been killed or injured in stampedes. The sites are far from the Embassy of Canada to Saudi Arabia, in Riyadh. Contact your travel agent for information on available services and support.

### Crime

The crime rate is low. Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs, especially in crowded areas and at holy sites.

* Do not show signs of affluence
* Keep your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, in a secure place

### Roads

#### Road conditions

Roads in rural areas are less developed, and driving can be dangerous due to:

* unpaved or uneven surfaces
* insufficient lighting
* lack of maintenance
* camel crossings
* poorly maintained vehicles

#### Driving habits

Speeding is common and drivers often disregard traffic laws, including road markings. Fatal car accidents are frequent.

If you’re involved in an accident:

* immediately contact the police and Najm
* do not leave the scene or move your car until the police arrive
* do not make any financial arrangements with the other drivers

In a traffic accident resulting in personal injury, regardless of fault, drivers may be held for several days until responsibility is determined and restitution is made. If severe injuries or death occur, compensation may need to be paid to the victim’s family for the injuries or loss of life.

### Public transportation

#### Taxis

Only use pre-arranged and licensed taxis or ride-sharing services. Avoid shared or unregistered taxis.

### Marine transportation

Exercise caution if travelling by sea, including for recreational purposes in Red Sea waters close to Yemen and in the Persian Gulf, particularly around the disputed islands of Abu Musa and Tunbs. Iran and the United Arab Emirates each claim sovereignty over the islands.

Pirate attacks occur in coastal waters and, in some cases, farther out at sea. Travellers should take appropriate precautions.
