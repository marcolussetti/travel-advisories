# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

The authorities of a country or territory decide who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from Saudi authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country's entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond the date you expect to leave Saudi Arabia.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

You should also be aware that current systems used by some countries and travel companies may not recognize the “X” gender identifier. You may still be asked to provide your sex/gender information as either male or female when travelling.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Visas

Tourist visa: required   
Business visa: required   
Student visa: required

Overstaying your visa will result in heavy fines and you will be unable to exit the country until the fine has been paid.

#### Tourist visa

You can obtain a tourist visa online before your trip or upon arrival at the airport. The tourist visa allows for multiple entries and is valid for one year. You can stay up to a maximum of 90 days in total per year. Muslim tourists can perform Umrah with any type of visa, but a specific visa is required to perform Hajj.

### Pilgrimage

You must present a valid Hajj visa if you travel to Saudi Arabia for the Hajj. This visa is only valid for travel to Jeddah, Mecca and Medina, and for travel between these cities. Non-Muslims are forbidden from travelling to the holy city of Mecca. Pilgrims performing Hajj must make arrangements on a dedicated online platform.

Women of all ages may travel without a mahram (male guardian, such as a brother, father or husband) to perform Hajj or Umrah. A notarized letter of no objection from the mahram is no longer required.

In the period preceding and during the Hajj pilgrimage, Muslim visitors require a valid Hajj visa to board flights to Jeddah, Medina and Taif. Muslims with business or tourist visas may enter Saudi Arabia through any other entry point.

### Entry and exit visas

#### Holders of a resident permit

If you have a resident permit (iqama), you can't leave the country without obtaining an exit visa or exit/re-entry visa from the Saudi Ministry of Interior if you intend to return to Saudi Arabia. You must have your sponsor's approval to obtain these visas.

### Single-entry visa

Single-entry visa holders don't need an exit visa.

### Outstanding fees for dependents

Prior to exit, expatriates who have outstanding fees for dependents may be required to pay at the point of exit prior to departure if they have an exit/re-entry visa, or on renewal of their exit/re-entry visa.

### Regional travel

Canadians have been denied entry into Saudi Arabia because their passports bore an Israeli visa, an Israeli border stamp or an Egyptian or Jordanian border stamp issued by an office bordering Israel. Such a stamp would indicate the traveller visited Israel prior to coming to Saudi Arabia.

### Health entry and stay requirements

You must provide a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test certificate and proof of a criminal background check if you intend to work in Saudi Arabia.
