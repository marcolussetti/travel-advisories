# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Saudi Arabian authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you use for travel.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond the date you expect to leave Saudi Arabia.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

All visa applications, with the exception of applications for tourist visas, must be sponsored by a Saudi citizen, a travel agency, or an organization.

#### Tourist visa

You can obtain a tourist visa online before your trip or upon arrival at the airport. The tourist visa allows for multiple entries and is valid for one year. You can stay up to a maximum of 90 days in total per visa. You cannot extend a visa. Muslim tourists can perform Umrah with any type of visa. A specific visa is required to perform Hajj.

#### Obtaining a visa

You can obtain a visa at an agency authorized by the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia to Canada in Ottawa. If you reside in a foreign country, you may obtain a visa from the nearest Saudi embassy or consulate.

#### Women entering Saudi Arabia

Women must be met by their sponsors at the port of arrival or risk being denied entry. This does not apply to women entering the country on a tourist visa.

### Pilgrimage

You must present a valid Hajj visa if you travel to Saudi Arabia for the pilgrimage. This visa is only valid for travel to Jeddah, Mecca and Medina, and for travel between these cities. Non-Muslims are forbidden from travelling to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Pilgrims performing Hajj must travel with a travel agency that is accredited with the Saudi Ministry of Hajj and Umrah.

Women of all ages may travel without a mahram (male guardian, such as a brother, father or husband) to perform Hajj or Umrah. A notarized letter of no objection from the husband, son or brother is no longer required.

In the period preceding and during the Hajj pilgrimage, Muslim visitors with a valid Hajj visa will be allowed to board flights to Jeddah, Medina and Taif. Muslim travellers with business or visit visas must enter through any other entry point.

### Entry and exit permits

#### Holders of residency permits

If you have a resident permit (iqama), you can't leave the country without obtaining an exit (or exit/re-entry visa if you intend to return to Saudi Arabia) from the Saudi Ministry of Interior. You must have your sponsor's approval to obtain these visas.

#### Single-entry visa

Single-entry visa holders don't need an exit permit.

#### Outstanding fees for dependents

Prior to exit, expatriates who have outstanding fees for dependents may be required to pay at the point of exit prior to departure if they have an exit re-entry visa, or on renewal of their exit re-entry visa.

### Regional travel

Canadians have been denied entry into Saudi Arabia because their passports bore an Israeli visa, an Israeli border stamp or an Egyptian or Jordanian border stamp issued by an office bordering Israel. Such a stamp would indicate the traveller visited Israel prior to coming to Saudi Arabia.

### Health entry requirements

You must produce a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test certificate and proof of a criminal background check if you intend to work in Saudi Arabia.
