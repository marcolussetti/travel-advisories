# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing, bag snatching and theft from vehicles, is common, especially in Ponta Delgada and Rabo de Peixe.

Be particularly vigilant in crowded public areas such as:

* popular tourist areas, including lookouts
* buses, bus stations, and airports
* hotel lobbies
* restaurants, including outdoor seating areas
* beaches

During your trip:

* keep your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, in a secure place
* do not show signs of affluence or wear expensive jewellery
* do not carry large sums of cash or valuables unnecessarily
* avoid walking alone after dark
* be aware of your surroundings, especially in busy tourist areas
* avoid using ATMs in isolated or poorly lit areas
* never leave personal belongings unattended in a vehicle, even in the trunk

### Terrorism

While there have been no recent terrorist attacks in the Azores, they can still happen. There is a threat of terrorism in Europe. Terrorists have carried out attacks in several European cities and further attacks are likely.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including police stations
* schools, including universities
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners
* cultural venues

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

Be particularly vigilant during sporting events, religious holidays, public celebrations and major political events, such as elections, as terrorists have used such occasions to mount attacks.

The Portuguese government maintains a public alert system on terrorism and communicates threat-level changes online and through social media. Portugal's current threat level is 3, “significant,” on a scale of 5.

### Spiked food, drinks and other items

Criminals sometimes add drugs to items that could put you at risk of sexual assault or robbery.

Items may include:

* food and drinks
* gum
* cigarettes

Incidents are most likely to occur in nightclubs, bars and restaurants.

While you’re in the Azores:

* be wary of accepting these items from new acquaintances
* never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers
* order drinks in sealed bottles or cans instead of in plastic cups

### Water activities

Coastal waters can be dangerous, even for excellent swimmers. Coastal ocean currents are powerful and rip currents are common. Drownings occur every year.

Always obey warning flags at beaches, lakes and rivers.

The flags are there for your own safety. The Portuguese Maritime Police could fine you for disobeying a warning flag.

Jellyfish, stingrays and other marine life found in swimming areas can poison, sting or cause infection if touched or stepped on.

Ask local authorities about the presence of such species and whether they are dangerous.

* Do not visit beaches or coastal areas during periods of severe weather warnings
* Look out for signs of cliff erosion and falling rocks
* Do not dive into unknown waters, as hidden rocks or shallow depths can cause serious injury or death
* Exercise caution and follow the advice of the local authorities

### Adventure tourism

Outdoor activities such as hiking and mountain biking can be dangerous.

If you intend to participate in adventure tourism activities:

* share your itinerary with a friend or family member if you’re alone
* stay on marked trails and consider hiring an experienced guide from a reputable company
* obtain detailed information on your activity and the environment in which you will be setting out
* buy travel insurance that covers incidents related to these types of recreational activities
* ensure that you have proper equipment and bring sufficient water
* monitor weather conditions and other possible hazards

### Roads

#### Road safety

Road safety may vary across the Azores.

Accidents are frequent.

#### Road conditions

Road conditions vary across the islands.

Rapidly changing weather conditions, such as heavy rains, strong winds and thick fog, can pose a hazard.

Driving can also be dangerous due to:

* insufficient lighting
* potholes
* unpaved roads
* poorly maintained roads
* lack of traffic signs
* livestock
* narrow, winding and mountainous roads

#### Driving habits

Drivers don’t always respect traffic laws and often speed.

If you choose to drive in the Azores:

* always drive defensively
* avoid travelling after dark
* always carry a cell phone and a charger

### Public transportation

#### Taxis

Most taxis don’t have meters. You will be charged a base fee plus a posted rate for the distance you travel.
