# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs, particularly in major cities, at popular tourist sites such as the Grand-Place (Grote Markt) in Brussels. Be cautious of distraction tactics employed by criminals, such as:

* spilling drinks
* engaging you in lengthy conversations
* posing odd questions
* persistent offers to assist you

Pickpockets also target passengers in transportation hubs such as:

* the metro
* train stations
* airports

Incidents of petty crime on trains along the Paris–Brussels–Amsterdam and Brussels–London routes are frequent, as well as at the following train stations:

* Gare de Bruxelles-Nord (Noordstation)
* Gare de Bruxelles-Centrale (Centraalstation)
* Gare de Bruxelles-Midi (Zuidstation)

While in Belgium:

* don’t carry large sums of cash or valuables unnecessarily
* ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times, particularly on public transportation
* take extra precautions on trains, as criminals often steal carry-on luggage from overhead compartments or from below seats
* never leave your luggage unattended
* keep car windows and doors locked at all times
* don’t leave any valuables in plain sight inside of vehicles

#### Violent crime

Incidents of violent crime are on the rise.

You should exercise increased caution due to a recent surge in violent crimes, including shootings and stabbings, in the Brussels-Capital Region and other major cities. You should remain vigilant despite local authorities’ response to these incidents and report any suspicious activities to the police.

If you find yourself in a dangerous situation:

* seek shelter immediately
* contact local authorities

Criminal gangs use ports on Belgium’s North Sea coast as a point of entry for drug trafficking and other contraband. This is particularly prevalent in Ostend and Antwerp. Clashes between rival gangs have led to violent incidents in Antwerp and its suburbs, including bombings and shootings.

Criminals do not tend to target bystanders, but there is always the risk of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

* Be aware of your surroundings
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Expect a heightened police presence in certain areas

Armed robbers and organized gangs have targeted jewellers, banks and individuals carrying cash and valuables. Use caution when using ATMs, especially after dark

### Fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud occurs. When using debit or credit cards:

* pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others, and don’t let servers or merchants take your card out of sight
* use ATMs located in public areas or inside a bank or business
* check ATMs or other machines for skimmers or removable readers, and avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in Europe. Terrorists have carried out attacks in several European cities.

In Belgium, separate attacks causing multiple deaths and injuries have taken place. Further attacks in Belgium cannot be ruled out. Further attacks elsewhere in Europe are also likely.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places. Be particularly vigilant if attending sporting events, and during religious holidays and other public celebrations, as terrorists have used such occasions to mount attacks.

#### Enhanced security measures

Following a shooting in Brussels in October 2023, the national threat level increased to level 3 on a scale of 4.

Expect heightened security measures, including:

* an increased police presence across the country
* increased caution and scrutiny from security forces
* potential added security measures in certain places

#### Public alert system

The Government of Belgium maintains a public alert system on terrorism and communicates threat level changes online and through local media and social media.

### Strikes

Strikes and pressure tactics occur regularly, particularly in key sectors such as transport. These strikes can sometimes complicate travel and disrupt public services.

* Consult local media to be aware of strikes that may affect your stay or travel plans
* In the event of a transport strike, plan extra time to get to your destination

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations take place frequently, especially in Brussels in the city centre and the European Quarter. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety are very good throughout the country.

The “priority to the right” system is in effect in Belgium.  Drivers must give way to vehicles approaching from the right at intersections. This is often a surprise to foreign drivers and results in accidents.

Familiarize yourself with the “priority to the right” system.
