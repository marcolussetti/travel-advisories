### Dual citizenship

Suriname doesn’t legally recognize dual citizenship.

According to the government, persons born in Suriname who subsequently gained another citizenship, such as Canadian, have lost their Surinamese status and will be considered a foreigner.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Suriname.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Suriname by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Suriname to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Driving

Traffic drives on the left.

You must carry an international driving permit.

You need a local driver’s permit to drive in Suriname. You may obtain a one-year valid local driver’s permit in Paramaribo, upon a deposit at the head office of the Suriname Postal Service and the presentation of your valid Canadian driver’s licence at a police station. Vehicles with foreign plates are required to undergo a vehicle overhaul test to ensure that the vehicle meets Surinamese traffic standards. The owner will then be granted a Surinamese licence plate.

### Money

The currency of Suriname is the Surinamese dollar.

The economy is primarily cash based. Only major hotels and some restaurants accept credit cards.

It is illegal to exchange money on the street. Use only hotels, local banks or official money exchanges (cambios) to exchange currency.
