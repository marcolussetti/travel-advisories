# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Suriname authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you use for travel.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond the date you arrive in Suriname.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Extended stay

If you intend to stay in Suriname for more than 3 months, you must apply for an Authorization for Temporary Stay (known as an MKV) from the nearest Surinamese embassy before travelling. If you are travelling with a tourist or business visa, you cannot apply for residence during your stay in Suriname.

### Registration

After 30 days in Suriname, all foreigners are required to report within one week to the police services of the Immigration Section to obtain an extension-of-stay stamp.

### Children and travel

Minors under the age of 18 travelling without a parent or legal guardian must have:

* a signed consent form from one parent or legal guardian confirming the dates of travel
* a photocopy of one of the parent or legal guardian’s passports
* an evidence of parental responsibility or legal custody
