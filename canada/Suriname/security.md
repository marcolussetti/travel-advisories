# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Crime

Police presence outside Paramaribo is scarce.

#### Petty Crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching is common in Paramaribo and surrounding areas. Major business districts and shopping areas and areas near popular hotels are particularly affected.

Theft from vehicles and carjacking also occur.

Foreigners are often targeted by criminals.

* Ensure that your belongings, including passports and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Do not show signs of affluence
* Avoid walking alone after dark outside the immediate vicinity of major hotels

#### Violent Crime

Violent crime, such as armed robbery, burglary and carjacking occur, particularly in Paramaribo. The Palm Garden (“Palmentuin”) in Paramaribo’s Dutch area is known for illicit activities and the lack of police presence. Robberies are also of particular concern:

* in the cities of Albina and Moengo
* along the East–West highway between Paramaribo and Albina
* along the Afobakka Highway in the district of Para and
* the Brokopondo district

Gangs are known to operate along the border with Guyana. The lack of police presence increases the risk of travelling to this area.

* Avoid walking alone at night
* Drive with your windows closed and always lock your doors when leaving your vehicle unattended

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations take place regularly, particularly on Saturdays in Paramaribo. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Do not attempt to cross blockades, even if they appear unattended.
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Trekking

The dense jungle and local fauna can be hazardous. If you intend on trekking:

* never do so alone and always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* ensure that you’re properly equipped and well informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary, including when you expect to be back to camp
* know the symptoms of high-altitude illnesses, which can be fatal
* obtain detailed information on trekking routes or ski slopes before setting out and do not venture off marked trails or slopes

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety can vary greatly throughout the country, but are generally poor outside major centres. In Paramaribo, most roads are paved but not well maintained. Many roads do not have sidewalks, forcing pedestrians and bicycles to share the road with motor vehicles. Inadequate lighting, dangerous driving and poorly maintained vehicles pose further hazards.

Motorcycles and scooters cannot occupy a full lane in Suriname. Avoid riding motorcycles or scooters, as sharing the road with cars is very dangerous.

Driving conditions may be hazardous during the rainy season.

### Public transportation

#### Minibuses

Avoid using public minibuses.

#### Taxis

Taxis are available at major hotels.

* Agree on a fare prior to departure
* If you hail a taxi on the street, be aware that they tend to overcharge foreigners
