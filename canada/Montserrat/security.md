## Safety and security

### Crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs.

Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times.

### Water activities

#### Swimming

Coastal waters can be dangerous. Riptides are common.

Follow the instructions and warnings of local authorities.

#### Diving

Tour operators may not adhere to international standards.

If you participate in water sports, such as diving:

* choose a well-established and reputable company that has insurance
* ensure that your travel insurance covers the recreational activities you choose

If in doubt concerning the safety of the facilities or equipment, don’t use them.

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety can vary greatly throughout the country.

Be careful when driving after dark and in the mountainous regions due to steep, narrow and winding roads.

Volcanic ash on the roads can cause slippery driving conditions.

### Public transportation

#### Taxis

Taxis aren’t metered. Agree on a fare before departure.

#### Buses

Minibuses will stop anywhere on the main road so that passengers can get on and off. They operate primarily during the day and do not follow a set schedule.

#### Ferries

Ferry services are available between Montserrat, Antigua and Barbuda, and Saint Kitts and Nevis.

### Air travel

We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.
