## Natural disasters and climate

### Hurricane season

The hurricane season is from early June to the end of November in the Atlantic, Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. During this period, even small tropical storms can quickly develop into major hurricanes.

These severe storms can put you at risk and hamper the provision of essential services. You could face serious safety risks during a hurricane. You should carefully consider these risks when planning a trip during the hurricane season.

If you decide to travel to a coastal area during the hurricane season despite the risks:

* be prepared to change your travel plans on short notice, including cutting short or cancelling your trip
* stay informed of the latest regional weather forecasts
* carry emergency contact information for your airline or tour operator
* follow the advice and instructions of local authorities

### Volcano

The Soufrière Hills Volcano is active but has not erupted since February 2010.

Local authorities constantly monitor volcanic activity and assess alert levels.

An island-wide alert system is in place to warn the population of volcanic activity. Make sure you have your security arrangements in mind.

If you hear an alert:

* immediately tune in to Radio Montserrat ZJB on 88.3 FM or 95.5 FM for information
* follow the instructions of local authorities

There are several "exclusion" zones around the volcano, comprising land and sea areas. You require prior authorization to visit some of these zones.
