## Natural disasters and climate

### Earthquakes and tsunamis

El Salvador is located in a highly active seismic zone. Tremors occur regularly and major earthquakes occur from time to time.

Tsunami warnings may be issued after a strong earthquake. A tsunami can occur within minutes of a nearby earthquake. However, the risk of tsunami can remain for several hours following the first tremor. If you’re staying on the coast, familiarize yourself with the region’s evacuation plans in the event of a tsunami warning.

In the event of an earthquake:

* monitor local media to stay informed of the evolving situation
* follow the instructions of local authorities

### Volcanoes

Volcanoes pose a significant risk to the population in El Salvador.

Although there has been a decrease in volcanic activity in recent years, several volcanoes remain active. Authorities issue warnings about volcanic activity when appropriate, especially at the San Miguel/Chaparrastique volcano.

If you intend on visiting a volcano area:

* hire an experienced guide from a reputable company
* monitor levels of volcanic activity through the local media
* pay close attention to all warnings and avoid restricted areas
* be prepared to modify your travel arrangements or even evacuate the area on short notice
* follow the advice of local authorities

### Rainy season

The rainy season extends from May to November. Seasonal flooding can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable and bridges may be damaged.

### Hurricane season

Hurricanes usually occur from mid-May to the end of November. During this period, even small tropical storms can quickly develop into major hurricanes.

These severe storms can put you at risk and hamper the provision of essential services. You could face serious safety risks during a hurricane.

If you decide to travel to a coastal area during the hurricane season:

* be prepared to change your travel plans on short notice, including cutting short or cancelling your trip
* stay informed of the latest regional weather forecasts
* carry emergency contact information for your airline or tour operator
* follow the advice and instructions of local authorities
