# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Emergency measures

In March 2022, the government of El Salvador implemented a “state of exception” (emergency measures), resulting in the suspension of key constitutional rights and massive arrests of suspected criminals.

Although the security situation has significantly improved throughout the country, the state of exception remains in effect. As a result, security forces have increased rights to conduct searches, seizures, and detain persons of interest, including foreign citizens.

Local authorities have detained foreign citizens, sometimes in a reportedly arbitrary manner. Individuals imprisoned under the state of exception do not have access to due process such as a fair or timely trial. Prison conditions can be harsh, and consular assistance can be delayed under the current circumstances.

If you're in El Salvador:

* be aware that you may be subject to searches by security forces
* expect a heightened security presence, including on roads, in public spaces, and in residential neighbourhoods
* always carry valid identification and be prepared for various checkpoints
* monitor local media for the latest information
* follow the instructions of local authorities
* respect all local laws including road safety laws, which include a zero-tolerance approach to drinking and driving
* remember that drugs, including cannabis, are illegal and penalties for possession, use or trafficking are severe

### Crime

Since 2022, gang activity in El Salvador has been severely disrupted, resulting in a major reduction in violent crime and homicides. Despite this progress, risks of petty and violent crime remain.

#### Petty crime

Theft occurs frequently, particularly on public transportation. Thieves may target tourists.

Thieves also break into cars parked in public places.

During your trip:

* avoid displaying signs of affluence in public
* keep your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, in a secure place
* avoid walking alone at night
* be aware of your surroundings, especially in busy tourist areas
* do not carry large sums of cash or valuables unnecessarily
* be extra cautious when withdrawing cash from ATMs
* choose supervised parking lots, if available, and do not leave valuables in your car

If you're robbed, go to a police station and report the crime immediately. Most police officers don’t speak English or French.

#### Violent crime

Violent crime occurs sometimes, namely:

* armed robberies
* burglaries
* assaults, including sexual and physical assaults

#### Armed robbery

Armed robberies occur with weapons such as guns and knives, especially on public transportation. Robberies by thieves on motorcycles occur.

During your stay:

* always be aware of your surroundings
* stay at hotels that have robust security measures
* if you’re robbed, hand over your cash, electronic devices, and valuables without resistance
* avoid eye contact with the perpetrators

#### Sexual assault

Incidents of sexual assault occur, including on public buses and at beaches.

* Avoid travelling alone, with informal guides or with strangers, even if they appear friendly and helpful
* Avoid public buses and large crowds on the street
* Exercise caution at nightclubs and beaches

If you are a victim of sexual assault, report it to the police and contact the Embassy of Canada in San Salvador. In addition, consider seeking immediate medical attention.

#### Greater San Salvador Area

In the city of San Salvador, the downtown area can pose risks to tourists due to petty crime. However, the Centro Histórico is much safer due to the dedicated efforts of local authorities. This area consists of a few blocks in downtown San Salvador where several places of historical and cultural interest are located:

* the Metropolitan Cathedral
* the National Palace
* the National Theatre
* Plaza Barrios
* Plaza Libertad
* Plaza Morazán

#### Border crossings

Border areas often see higher criminal activity and violence, including in rural areas.

El Salvador lies along well-established Central American trafficking routes. Criminal groups smuggling people, guns or drugs can be violent. There have been incidents of travellers being attacked near border crossings, particularly on the Guatemalan side of the border.

Some border crossings occasionally close without warning.

If you plan to cross land borders in El Salvador:

* do so early enough so you arrive at destination before dark
* use official border crossings only
* avoid exchanging currency
* avoid displaying money or valuable items such as jewellery and electronic equipment

### Fraud

Credit card, ATM and Bitcoin e-wallet fraud occurs. There have been reports of identity theft and failed transactions, especially involving credit cards and Chivo, a local Bitcoin e-wallet.

When using debit or credit cards or Bitcoin e-wallets:

* pay careful attention if others are handling your cards
* use ATMs located in public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

### Online activities

Salvadoran authorities have arrested people over social media posts. Avoid commenting on local or political events on your social media.

### Harassment

Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Harassment and acts of violence are sometimes committed against 2SLGBTQI+ persons.

2SLGBTQI+ persons should carefully consider the risks of travelling to El Salvador.

### Spiked food, drinks and other items

Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

### Hiking

Access to volcanoes may be restricted due to volcanic activity or high winds, especially:

* Izalco volcano
* Santa Ana, also known as Ilamatepec, volcano
* San Miguel, also known as Chaparrastique, volcano

If you intend to go hiking:

* never do so alone and always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that you’re properly equipped and that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* ensure that you’re well informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary, including when you expect to be back
* know the symptoms of high-altitude illnesses, which can be fatal
* obtain detailed information on routes before setting out and do not venture off marked trails

### Water activities

Coastal waters can be dangerous, even for experienced swimmers. Riptides and undertows are common. Several drownings occur each year.

Some beaches are unsupervised. Lifeguard services don’t always meet Canadian standards.

If you plan on swimming or surfing:

* consult residents and tour operators for information on possible hazards and safe areas
* follow the instructions and warnings of local authorities or lifeguards
* avoid isolated beaches
* monitor weather reports, especially during the rainy season, as prolonged periods of rain can cause the height of waves to increase along beaches

If you plan on participating in boating activities, such as whale-watching:

* choose a well-established and reputable company that has insurance
* make sure the vessel you are boarding is carrying appropriate safety equipment and that life jackets are provided for all passengers and accessible at all times
* do not board vessels that appear overloaded or unseaworthy

If in doubt concerning the safety of the facilities or equipment, don’t use them.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations occur sometimes. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

El Salvador’s constitution prohibits political activity by foreigners. Participating in demonstrations or political activities may result in you being detained or deported.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Roads

Road conditions and road safety vary greatly throughout the country. Serious accidents are common.

#### Road conditions

Many rural roads are unpaved and some rural areas are accessible only by four-wheel-drive vehicle.

Roundabouts are common.

Driving can be dangerous due to:

* dangerous curves in roads
* poor road markings and signage
* poor lighting at night
* potholes and missing manhole covers
* construction sites
* roaming livestock
* pedestrians on the shoulder of highways
* slow-moving, overloaded or poorly maintained vehicles

#### Driving habits

Drivers don’t always respect traffic laws.  They can be aggressive and reckless, and frequently overtake on both the right and the left.

Bus drivers and motorcyclists in particular can be aggressive or unpredictable.

Narrow lanes and heavy traffic offer little courtesy for cyclists. Most Salvadoran cyclists have a car that follows them on their journeys for safety reasons.

If you choose to drive:

* always drive defensively
* plan your trip ahead of time, especially if you plan to visit a rural area
* use caution when entering a roundabout
* avoid road travel at night between cities
* avoid stopping at isolated viewpoints
* keep your car doors locked and the windows closed at all times
* avoid hitchhiking, which is not a common practice in El Salvador

#### Checkpoints

Police traffic checkpoints are common across the country. Officers will often ask to see your valid documents and your mandatory safety equipment. They may also be checking for impaired drivers or gang members. Tattoos may be considered an indication of gang affiliation.

* Do not drink any alcohol before driving
* Always cooperate with military and police officers
* Always carry valid identification

### Public transportation

#### Buses

Buses are often unreliable. They are poorly maintained and the site of petty theft, armed robbery and sexual harassment.

* Do not use local or intercity public buses
* Use only reputable tour operators and international coach services

#### Taxis and ridesharing services

Taxis are widely available but vary in quality. Major hotels work with executive transport companies.

When travelling to the airport, you may pre-arrange your transportation with your hotel prior to your departure. Authorized airport taxi drivers wear easily identifiable identification badges.

If using a taxi in El Salvador:

* do not board taxis at taxi stands
* do not hail taxis in the street
* negotiate fares in advance

Ridesharing services are available in much of greater San Salvador. If you use a trusted ridesharing app, confirm the driver’s identity and the licence plate before getting in the car.
