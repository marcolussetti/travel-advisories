# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Emergency measures

In March 2022, the government of El Salvador implemented emergency measures, resulting in massive arrests of suspected criminals. These measures frequently involve deploying military and security forces to targeted areas to combat organized crime.

Although the security situation has improved, a state of exception remains in effect. As a result, security forces have increased rights to conduct searches, seizures, and detain persons of interest, including foreign citizens. Local authorities have detained foreigners, sometimes in a reportedly arbitrary manner.

If you're in El Salvador:

* be aware that you may be subject to searches by security forces
* expect a heightened security presence, including on roads, in public spaces, and in residential neighbourhoods
* always cooperate with military and police officers
* always carry valid identification and be prepared for various checkpoints
* limit your movements after dark
* ensure family or friends know where you are
* monitor local media for the latest information
* follow the instructions of local authorities

### Crime

Crime is a serious problem throughout the country.

#### Violent crime

Violent crime has decreased significantly since March 2022, especially in urban areas, including the metropolitan area of San Salvador and resort areas. However, violent crime still occurs, often involving armed gang members as well as common and petty criminals.

Armed robberies occur with weapons such as guns and knives, especially on public transportation. Robberies by thieves on motorcycles occur. Robberies may occur in tourist areas, especially isolated scenic spots.

* Remain vigilant and exercise caution at all times
* Don’t show signs of affluence or display valuables, particularly jewellery and electronics, including cell phones
* Check in advance with local contacts, authorities or hotels to see if your chosen destination is safe and which is the best route to get there
* Travel in groups if possible
* Avoid walking after dark
* Stay at hotels that have robust security measures
* Keep in mind that even the most secure locations are not completely free of risk

If you're threatened by armed criminals:

* don't resist, as gang members in particular can be quick to engage in violence
* avoid eye contact with the perpetrators

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, is common.

Thieves also break into cars parked in public places.

* Avoid displaying signs of affluence in public, including when landing at El Salvador's international airport
* Ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Avoid carrying large amounts of cash
* Be particularly discreet when using ATMs
* Choose supervised parking lots if available
* Keep car doors locked and windows closed at all times
* Don't leave any valuables in your car

If you're robbed, go to a police station and report the crime immediately.

Most Salvadorans don’t speak English or French. You should not expect assistance in your preferred language.

#### Greater San Salvador Area

In the city of San Salvador, neighbourhoods such as Escalón, La Cima, San Benito and San Francisco are relatively safe.

To attract more tourists, local authorities have made efforts to secure a few blocks in the downtown area, known as the Centro Histórico de San Salvador. The Centro Histórico includes:

* the Metropolitan Cathedral
* the National Palace
* the National Theatre
* Plaza Barrios
* Plaza Libertad
* Plaza Morazán

Outside that area, the entire downtown is unsafe for tourists.

Dangerous areas in San Salvador can be as small as two or three blocks in a broader generally safe neighbourhood. They are often known as “zonas marginales” or “comunidades.”

Avoid crossing an area that is a known criminal stronghold, even if you are only trying reach a safer neighbourhood.

Neighbouring cities to the west of the capital are generally safe. These include:

* Antiguo Cuscatlán, including Santa Elena
* Nuevo Cuscatlán
* Santa Tecla, including Ciudad Merliot

Crime occurs more frequently in cities to the north and east, such as:

* Apopa
* Ciudad Delgado
* Ilopango
* Mejicanos
* San Martín
* Soyapango

#### Border crossings

Border areas often see higher criminal activity and violence, including in rural areas.

El Salvador lies along well-established Central American trafficking routes. Criminal groups smuggling people, guns or drugs can be violent. There have been incidents of travellers being attacked near border crossings.

Some border crossings occasionally close without warning.

If you plan to cross land borders in El Salvador:

* do so early enough so you arrive at destination before dark
* use official border crossings only
* avoid exchanging currency
* avoid displaying money or valuable items such as jewellery and electronic equipment

#### Organized crime

Gang-related crime has reduced significantly since March 2022, when the government began major efforts to contain gang-related crime and arrest thousands of gang members. While gang violence rarely targets foreigners, violent assaults against tourists may occur.

Violent incidents carried out by gangs are frequent, including:

* murder
* armed robbery
* kidnapping
* extortion
* mugging
* assaults, especially on highways
* home invasion
* car theft

There are urban neighbourhoods and rural areas with one or few entrances where local gang members monitor non-residents to rob them.

Tattoos may be considered as an indication of gang affiliation. Travellers should consider covering tattoos when travelling in El Salvador.

#### Express kidnappings

Express kidnappings occur, particularly in high-crime areas.

In this scenario, criminals kidnap the victim and force the person to withdraw funds from an ATM.

Victims are generally selected on the basis of perceived wealth, including driving late-model cars. They are identified at places such as:

* shopping centres
* gas stations
* restaurants
* nightclubs
* banks
* parking lots

### Fraud

Credit card, ATM and Bitcoin e-wallet fraud occurs. There have been reports of identity theft and failed transactions, especially involving Chivo, the Salvadoran government’s official Bitcoin e-wallet.

When using debit or credit cards or Bitcoin e-wallets:

* pay careful attention if others are handling your cards
* use ATMs located public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

### Women's safety

Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse.

Incidents of sexual assault occur, including on public buses and at beach areas.

* Avoid travelling alone, with informal guides or with strangers, even if they appear friendly and helpful
* Avoid public buses and large crowds on the street
* Exercise caution at nightclubs and beaches

If you are a victim of sexual assault, report it to the police and contact the Embassy of Canada in San Salvador.

### Spiked food and drinks

Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

### Soccer matches

Avoid crowds that can form without warning at sporting events such as soccer matches, as they have led to violent incidents. Exercise caution if attending a soccer match or if staying in the vicinity of sporting venues.

### Hiking

Criminals have targeted tourists climbing volcanoes and hiking in remote locations.

Access to volcanoes may also be restricted due to volcanic activity or high winds, especially:

* Izalco volcano
* Santa Ana, also known as Ilamatepec, volcano
* San Miguel, also known as Chaparrastique, volcano

If you intend to go hiking:

* never do so alone and always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* ensure that you're properly equipped
* ensure that you’re well informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary, including when you expect to be back
* know the symptoms of acute altitude sickness, which can be fatal
* obtain detailed information on routes before setting out and do not venture off marked trails

### Water activities

Coastal waters can be dangerous, even for experienced swimmers. Riptides are common. Several drownings occur each year.

Lifeguards don’t usually supervise beaches. Rescue services may not be consistent with international standards.

If you plan on swimming or surfing:

* consult residents and tour operators for information on possible hazards and safe areas
* follow the instructions and warnings of local authorities
* avoid isolated beaches
* monitor weather reports, especially during the rainy season, as prolonged periods of rain can cause the height of waves to increase along beaches

If you plan on participating in boating activities, such as whale-watching:

* choose a well-established and reputable company that has insurance
* make sure the vessel you are boarding is carrying appropriate safety equipment and that life jackets are provided for all passengers and accessible at all times
* don’t board vessels that appear overloaded or unseaworthy

If in doubt concerning the safety of the facilities or equipment, don’t use them.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations and protest marches take place regularly, especially on main roads in San Salvador near:

* the National Assembly
* the Presidential House
* San Salvador City Hall
* the Judicial District
* Cuscatlán Park
* Plaza Salvador del Mundo

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Road travel

Road conditions and road safety vary greatly throughout the country. Serious accidents are common.

#### Road conditions

Many rural roads are unpaved and some rural areas are accessible only by four-wheel-drive vehicle.

Roundabouts are common.

Driving can be dangerous due to:

* dangerous curves in roads
* poorly marked road signs
* poor lighting at night
* potholes and missing manhole covers
* construction sites
* roaming livestock
* pedestrians on the shoulder of highways
* slow-moving, overloaded or poorly maintained vehicles

#### Driving habits

Drivers don’t respect traffic laws. They often drive at excessive speeds. They are aggressive and reckless, and frequently overtake on both the right and the left.

Bus drivers and motorcyclists in particular can be aggressive or unpredictable.

Narrow lanes and heavy traffic offer little courtesy for cyclists. Most Salvadoran cyclists travel with a trailing car for safety.

#### Checkpoints

Police traffic checkpoints are common across the country. Officers will often ask to see your valid documents and your mandatory safety equipment. They may also be checking for impaired drivers or for gang members.

If you drive in El Salvador:

* always drive defensively
* plan your trip ahead of time, especially if you plan to visit a rural area
* use caution when entering a roundabout
* avoid road travel at night between cities
* avoid stopping at isolated viewpoints
* keep your car doors locked and the windows closed at all times
* avoid hitchhiking, which is not a common practice in El Salvador

### Public transportation

#### Buses

Buses are often unreliable. They are poorly maintained and the site of petty theft, armed robbery and sexual harassment.

* Don’t use local or intercity public buses
* Use only reputable tour operators and international coach services use only a company with a strong reputation

#### Taxis and ridesharing services

Taxis are widely available but vary in quality. Major hotels work with executive transport companies.

If using a taxi in El Salvador:

* don’t board taxis at taxi stands
* don’t hail taxis in the street
* negotiate fares in advance

Ridesharing services are available in much of greater San Salvador. If you use a trusted ridesharing app, confirm the driver’s identity and the licence plate before getting in the car.
