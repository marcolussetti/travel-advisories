# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Salvadoran authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid at the time of entry to El Salvador. It must also be in good condition and have at least one blank page.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Visas

Tourist visa: not required for stays up to 180 days  
 Business visa: not required for stays up to 180 days  
 Student visa: not required for stays up to 180 days

To extend your stay in El Salvador beyond 180 days, you must depart and re-enter El Salvador by air, land or sea.

### Central America-4 Border Control Agreement

Under the terms of the Central America-4 Border Control Agreement (CA-4), Canadian tourists may travel freely within any of the following CA-4 countries:

* El Salvador
* Guatemala
* Honduras
* Nicaragua

You can travel between these countries for up to 90 days without having to undergo entry and exit formalities at border immigration checkpoints. However, 90 days are not automatically granted. It is the immigration officer at your first entry point into the CA-4 region who will determine the exact length of your authorized stay.

You must still check in at immigration counters when you enter or exit these checkpoints.

Make sure you receive an entry or exit stamp in your passport each time you cross a checkpoint to avoid problems with immigration authorities and fines.

Salvadoran immigration authorities may grant you a stay of up to 180 days. However, other CA-4 countries only recognize the first 90 days. Keep this in mind when travelling within the CA-4 region to avoid problems with immigration authorities.

If you wish to extend your stay beyond 90 days within the CA-4 region, you must request an extension and pay the required fee at the designated immigration office in one of the other CA-4 countries before the 90-day limit expires. Immigration authorities will determine the exact length of the extension.

Once your total authorized stay expires, you must change your migratory status, leave the CA-4 region or return to El Salvador, where you may be granted a stay of up to 180 days. If you fail to do so, you will be fined and given 5 days to leave.

Once you leave the CA-4 region, you may attempt to return and restart the process without delay. However, the immigration officer could deny your re-entry.

If you get a new Canadian passport in El Salvador, you must obtain a new entry stamp from immigration authorities before exiting the country and travelling within the CA-4 region.

### Work or study

If you intend to work or study in El Salvador for longer than 180 days, you must apply for residence from inside the country. The documentation required to obtain Salvadoran residence is extensive.

Make sure you have all the required documents before you leave Canada.

### Other entry requirements

Customs officials may ask you to show them:

* a return or onward ticket
* proof of sufficient funds to cover the cost of your stay.

### Children and travel

A Canadian minor, under 18 years of age, living in or visiting El Salvador for more than one year is considered a resident of El Salvador.

To depart El Salvador, a minor resident needs written consent from any parent listed on the child’s birth certificate who is not travelling with the minor. The consent form must be:

* an original document (not a photocopy or a scan)
* notarized by either a Salvadoran notary in El Salvador or a Salvadoran consul abroad
