# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Salvadoran authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you use for travel.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond the date you expect to leave El Salvador.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Visas

Tourist visa: not required for stays up to 90 days  
Business visa: not required for stays up to 90 days  
Student visa: not required for stays up to 90 days

### Entry immigration card

To enter El Salvador, you must purchase an entry immigration card, which is valid for up to 180 days. Local officials determine the card's validity period.

The entry immigration card is not a visa, but it’s a mandatory requirement to enter El Salvador.

You don’t need an entry immigration card if you meet one of these conditions:

* hold a Canadian passport showing you were born in El Salvador
* show proof that one of your parents is a Salvadoran national

Keep the receipt of your entry immigration card with your passport. It will allow you to re-enter El Salvador, as long as it is still valid.

To extend your stay in El Salvador beyond 180 days, you must depart and re-enter El Salvador by air, land or sea and obtain a new entry immigration card.

### Entry and exit stamps

You must obtain entry and exit stamps at border crossings.

### Central America-4 Border Control Agreement

Under the terms of the Central America-4 Border Control Agreement (CA-4), your Salvadoran entry immigration card will allow you to travel for up to a total of 90 days within any of the CA-4 countries, which are:

* El Salvador
* Guatemala
* Honduras
* Nicaragua

When travelling between these countries, you still must check in at immigration counters but don’t need to obtain additional permits. Other countries’ authorities will stamp your passport to record your entry/exit dates and to ensure that you have not overstayed the initial time authorized for your visit in the CA-4 region. The 90-day period begins at your first point of entry to any of the CA-4 countries. You will be fined if you exceed the 90-day limit.

You may request an extension of up to 90 days once a year. If you are in El Salvador, you must request this extension and pay the required fee at El Salvador’s immigration headquarters in San Salvador at least 5 days before your first 90-day limit expires. Immigration authorities will determine the length of the extension.

If you have received a new Canadian passport while inside El Salvador – for example, your previous passport was lost – and you want to continue travelling by land in the CA-4 region, you need a new Salvadoran entry stamp in your new passport before entering one of the other countries. You must present your new passport at El Salvador’s immigration headquarters to arrange this.

### Work or study

If you intend to work or study in El Salvador for longer than 180 days, you must apply for residence from inside the country. The documentation required to obtain Salvadoran residence is extensive.

Make sure you have all the required documents before you leave Canada.

### Other entry requirements

Customs officials may ask you to show them a return or onward ticket and proof of sufficient funds to cover the cost of your stay.

### Children and travel

A Canadian minor, under 18 years of age, living in or visiting El Salvador for more than one year is considered a resident of El Salvador.

To depart El Salvador, a minor resident needs written consent from any parent listed on the child’s birth certificate who is not travelling with the minor. The consent form must be:

* an original document (not a photocopy or a scan)
* notarized by either a Salvadoran notary in El Salvador or a Salvadoran consul abroad.
