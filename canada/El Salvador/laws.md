### Political activities

El Salvador’s constitution prohibits political activities by foreigners.

You may be detained or deported if you participate in demonstrations or other political activities.

### Identification

You may be subject to identity checks during your stay in El Salvador.

Always carry valid identification such as a driver's licence or passport.

Keep photocopies or digital copies of the following, in case of loss or seizure of the original:

* the identification page of your passport
* your birth certificate
* your Canadian citizenship card
* your driver’s licence

Keep originals and copies in separate safe locations.

### Photography

It’s illegal to photograph:

* military installations and equipment
* schools when minors are present

Ask permission before photographing individuals, especially in areas with Indigenous presence.

### Imports and exports

Salvadoran authorities require permits for the import or export of firearms, plants or animals. If you purchase an antique in El Salvador, keep your receipt in case you are asked to prove ownership at the border.

### Investments

If you plan on buying property or making other investments in El Salvador, seek legal advice in Canada and in El Salvador before making any commitments. Disputes related to properties could take time and be costly to resolve.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in El Salvador.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of El Salvador, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and El Salvador.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in El Salvador, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Salvadoran court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in El Salvador to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

However, 2SLGBTQI+ persons could face discrimination based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression or sex characteristics.

### Driving

You can drive with your valid Canadian driver’s licence for the period you are allowed to stay in the country.

In the event of a car accident, as required by Salvadoran law:

* remain at the scene
* call the police
* don’t move your vehicle until the authorities arrive

Some accidents may attract a crowd that could turn hostile. If you feel unsafe:

* ensure your windows and doors are locked
* leave the area
* report the accident to the police and your insurance company as soon as possible

If you plan to travel between countries, you must carry an international driving permit.

### Money

There are two official currencies in El Salvador:

* the U.S. dollar (USD)
* Bitcoin (BTC)

Bitcoin became legal tender in September 2021, though not all businesses have fully transitioned to accepting it. Traditional and Bitcoin ATMs are widely available.

Canadian credit and debit cards are generally accepted. However, Canadian dollars cannot be exchanged in El Salvador.

When exchanging money before your trip, ask for small denominations. Bills of $50 and $100 are not widely accepted and increase the risk of robbery.
