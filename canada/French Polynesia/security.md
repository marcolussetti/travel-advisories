# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs. Violent crime is rare.

Ensure that personal belongings, including passports and other travel documents, are secure at all times.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations take place from time to time. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Water activities

#### Swimming

Lifeguards don’t usually supervise beaches. Tidal changes can cause powerful currents and riptides are common.

Rescue services may not be consistent with international standards.

* Consult residents and tour operators for information on possible hazards and safe swimming areas
* Wear reef shoes to protect yourself against coral cuts and stonefish
* Follow the instructions and warnings of local authorities

#### Diving

Tour operators may not adhere to international standards.

If you undertake adventure sports, such as diving:

* choose a well-established and reputable company that has insurance
* ensure that your travel insurance covers the recreational activities you choose

### Adventure tourism

If you engage in adventure tourism:

* never do so alone
* always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* ensure that you’re properly equipped
* ensure that you’re well informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary
* obtain detailed information on each activity before setting out

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety can vary greatly throughout the country.

Roads are narrow. Many secondary roads are not paved and don’t have streetlights.

Drivers don’t always respect traffic laws. Most of the time, they don’t give pedestrians the right of way.

Exercise caution, particularly after dark.
