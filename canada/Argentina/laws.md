### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Argentina.

### Surrogacy

There is currently no legislation that regulates surrogacy in Argentina. Local authorities may consider surrogacy arrangements to be illegal. Parents have faced practical and legal difficulties in obtaining birth certificates and when leaving the country with infants born via surrogacy. Criminal investigations into surrogacy agencies and associated service providers have occurred.

If you’re planning to visit Argentina for surrogacy arrangements, you should consider the potential challenges and risks involved. Seek independent legal advice on Argentine and Canadian laws prior to making any arrangements.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Argentina.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Argentina, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Argentinian court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Argentina to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Money

The currency is the Argentine peso (ARS).

Foreign credit and debit cards are accepted in main cities. When using credit cards, ensure that your card remains in your view. You may be required to produce photo identification, such as a driver’s licence or a photocopy of your passport, when paying with a credit card.

Cash withdrawals from foreign bank accounts at ATMs are subject to low limits per withdrawal and per day. Substantial service charges may apply when using non-Argentine bank cards. Check with your bank before leaving Canada.
