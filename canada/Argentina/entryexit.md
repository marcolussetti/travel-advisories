# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from Argentine authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for the expected duration of your stay in Argentina.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Other entry requirements

Upon entry into and exit from Argentina, all passengers, regardless of their citizenship, must undergo biometrics checks, such as digital fingerprints and a digital photograph, at the immigration counter.

Customs officials may ask you to show them a return or onward ticket and proof of sufficient funds to cover your stay.

### Dual citizenship

Canadian-Argentine dual citizens may leave Argentina on their Canadian passport if they entered on that passport within the previous 180 days. Once this period has elapsed, they must leave on a valid Argentine passport.

### Children and travel

Minors (under 18) born or residing in Argentina require written authorization from the non-accompanying parent/s to leave the country. They also require acceptable proof of parentage for the accompanying parent. For additional information, contact the National Directorate of Migration or the nearest embassy or consulate of Argentina.
