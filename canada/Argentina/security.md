## Safety and security

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse and cell phone snatching, occurs regularly.

Pickpocketers and bag snatchers work in pairs or in groups and employ a variety of distractions to divert their victim’s attention. In some cases, thieves on foot work with thieves on motorcycles, “motochorros”, to snatch purses, cell phones and backpacks sometimes even from a taxi.

Common theft scams include:

* distracting the victim by asking questions while another person carries out the theft
* spraying a substance on victims and then robbing them while pretending to help clean the stain
* putting merchandise such as dishcloths or socks on top of your phone at restaurants and picking up your phone along with the merchandise
* placing items on your windshield at traffic intersections to get you to roll down your window or to see what’s in your vehicle

Distraction thefts commonly occur in:

* popular tourist areas
* transportation terminals, including:

+ bus terminals
+ train stations
+ cruise and ferry terminals
+ airports
+ subways

* hotel lobbies
* restaurants and bars, including patios

To avoid becoming a victim:

* be suspicious of strangers approaching you, such as street vendors
* avoid showing signs of affluence such flashy jewellery, cell phones, and headphones
* ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* keep your bag between your feet in public places and in front of you on public transportation
* don’t leave purses or backpacks containing valuables in overhead compartments of long‑distance buses
* always ask restaurants and bars to bring the credit card machine to your table or bring your card to the machine
* avoid packing valuables in checked luggage, because organized groups are known to operate at airports searching for electronics and valuables

#### Violent crime

Armed robberies and muggings occur. While most victims are not physically injured, criminals may use violence if victims resist.

* If you’re robbed, hand over your cash and valuables without resistance.
* Avoid walking alone after dark, especially in the downtown areas of major cities and parks.

If you’re a victim of a crime, inform the police and get a police report. The emergency number in Argentina is 911.

### Vulnerable neighbourhoods

Avoid visiting vulnerable neighbourhoods (villa miseria) in major cities, including in Buenos Aires, even if they are in tourist zones.

Violence and organized crime are prevalent in these areas and police assistance is very limited.

### Drugs

Drug trafficking and abuse has increased in Argentina. This has resulted in violent crimes in:

* Buenos Aires

These aggressions are caused by persons who are under the influence of drugs who can be unpredictable.

* Congreso
* Constitución
* Florida Street
* La Boca
* Plaza de Mayo
* Puerto Madero
* Recoleta Cemetery
* the Retiro bus station area
* 9 de julio Avenue (around the Obelisk)

In La Boca, always remain on Caminito Street. Violent thefts often occur on neighbouring streets. Avoid the area after dark.

* obtain detailed information on trekking routes before setting out and do not venture off marked trails
