### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Eswatini. Eswatini citizens who acquired another citizenship by marriage or registration, might be asked to renounce that other citizenship or lose Eswatini citizenship. If you are a citizen of Canada, but also a citizen of Eswatini, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited in Eswatini.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Eswatini.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Eswatini by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Eswatini to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.
