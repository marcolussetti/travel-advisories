## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Transfer to a Canadian prison

Canada and Albania are signatories to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in Albania to request a transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both Canadian and Albania authorities.

This process can take a long time, and there is no guarantee that the transfer will be approved by either or both sides.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect prison sentences and heavy fines.

### Identification

Authorities may request to see your ID at any time. You must also present a passport upon check-in at a hotel or to rent a car.

* Carry valid identification or a photocopy of it at all times
* Keep a photocopy of your passport in case it’s lost or seized
* Keep a digital copy of your ID and travel documents

### Photography

Photography of military installations and critical infrastructure is regulated.

Request permission from local authorities before taking photographs of such installations.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Albania.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Albania, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Albania.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Albania, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Albanian court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Albania to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Albanian law doesn’t criminalize sexual acts or relationships between persons of the same sex.

However, 2SLGBTQI+ persons could be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or sex characteristics.

### Driving

You must carry an international driving permit.

The legal alcohol limit is 0.05 percent.

Police have taken drastic measures to decrease the number of accidents. They strictly enforced:

* laws against drinking and driving
* speed limits
* other traffic laws

Respect the rules of the road to avoid heavy fines and confiscation of your driver’s licence.

If you are involved in a road accident, even a minor one, wait for the police to arrive.
