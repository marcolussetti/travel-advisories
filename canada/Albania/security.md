## Safety and security

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Crimes of opportunity and petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occur. Thieves could target foreigners, particularly in crowded public areas such as:

* markets
* airports and public transportation facilities
* hotel lobbies
* restaurants, patios and outdoor cafés
* tourist sites and attractions

While travelling:

* ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* don’t keep your passport and other types of ID in the same place and carry a photocopy rather than the original
* avoid showing signs of affluence or wearing expensive jewellery
* avoid carrying large sums of cash or unnecessary valuables
* avoid deserted streets at night
* pay attention to your surroundings, particularly in crowded and tourist areas
* be extra cautious when withdrawing cash from ATMs

#### Residential break-ins

Residential break-ins occur. Burglars may target rental accommodations or houses and apartments owned by foreigners.

* Choose well-secured accommodation
* Make sure you lock doors and windows at night and when you’re away

#### Vehicles

Car theft and break-ins occur. Rental and luxury vehicles are a target of choice.

* Familiarize yourself with your route before starting the trip
* Keep your windows and doors locked at all times
* Keep your belongings out of reach
* Use secure parking facilities, especially overnight
* Never leave belongings unattended in a vehicle, even in the trunk

#### Violent crime

Organized crime-related violence occurs. Criminals may use firearms. In some instances, they have used improvised explosive devices.

While violent incidents don’t typically target foreigners or tourists, there is a risk of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

Always be vigilant and aware of your surroundings.

### Fraud

#### Credit card and ATM fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud occurs. When using debit or credit cards:

* pay careful attention when others are handling your cards  
  use ATMs located in public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

#### Cybercrime

Cybercrime also occurs. Perpetrators may compromise public Wi-Fi networks to steal credit card or personal information.

* Avoid using unsecured public Wi-Fi networks
* Avoid making purchases on unencrypted websites
* Use sound judgment when posting information on social media
* Be particularly vigilant when contacting or meeting individuals known over the internet
* Never click a suspicious link in an email or text message asking for your credit card details

### Spiked food and drinks

Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances.

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in Europe. Terrorist attacks have occurred in a number of European cities. Terrorist attacks could occur at any time.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places. Be particularly vigilant during:

* sporting events
* religious holidays
* public celebrations
* major political events, such as elections

Terrorists may use such occasions to mount attacks.

### Landmines and unexploded ordnance

Albania declared its landmine-free status in 2009. However, some areas remain clearly identified as dangerous zones or are surrounded by visible tape, especially along Albania’s northeastern border with Kosovo.

If you plan on visiting or hiking in these areas:

* pay attention to signs indicating the possible presence of landmines
* stay on paved roads
* avoid open fields, road shoulders and unmarked trails
* report anything suspicious to local authorities

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations take place from time to time.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Soccer matches and sports events

Sports events sometimes lead to rowdy behaviour and violent incidents.

Be vigilant if you attend soccer matches and sports rallies.

### Women’s safety

Women travelling alone in some rural areas may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse.

If you are a victim of sexual assault:

* seek medical assistance, even if you do not appear to have been physically harmed
* contact the local police immediately and ensure they file a report
* inform consular officials at the nearest Canadian embassy or consulate

### Water activities

#### Swimming

Coastal waters can be dangerous.

In the fall and winter months, waves can be unpredictable, breaking further than expected and causing strong undertows.

* Be cautious when walking on the shore
* Avoid visiting beaches or coastal areas during periods of severe weather warnings
* Always consider warning flags at beaches
* Don’t dive into unknown water, as hidden rocks or shallow depths can cause serious injury or death
* Follow the advice of local authorities

#### Recreational boating

If you are planning to go boating:

* know the navigation rules
* follow safe practices for all water activities such as jet-skiing, water-skiing, diving, swimming or fishing
* don’t overload your boat capacity
* carry a VHF marine radio that will generate your position in case of emergency
* be prepared for emergencies

### Mountain activities

Mountain activities, such as hiking, can be dangerous, especially if unprepared. Trails are not always marked and weather conditions can change rapidly, even in the summer. Cell phone reception can be unreliable in certain hiking areas.

If you intend to go hiking or climbing:

* share your itinerary with a friend or family member if you’re alone
* stay on marked trails and consider hiring an experienced guide from a reputable company
* consider using a global positioning system (GPS) device in remote areas
* buy travel insurance that covers incidents related to this type of recreational activity
* ensure that you have proper equipment and bring sufficient water
* monitor weather conditions and other possible hazards
* pay attention to signs indicating the possible presence of landmines

### Power outages

Power outages occur regularly, including in Tirana. They may affect the provision of essential services such as heating and water supply.

* Verify the schedule of power cuts with local authorities
* Make sure your phone is always charged
* Keep supplies of food, water and fuel on hand in case of lengthy disruptions
* Carry a flashlight

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety are poor throughout the country. Major roads are passable, but secondary roads lack maintenance.

Driving conditions may be hazardous during winter, particularly on mountainous roads in northern and southeastern Albania. Heavy rains and landslides can hamper overland travel. Roads, including major routes, may become impassable. Power outages can also affect street lighting and traffic signals. Low-speed farm equipment, horse-drawn carts and wandering livestock are also common hazards.

Drivers are aggressive and can be reckless. They don’t always respect traffic laws.

If you plan on driving in Albania:

* always drive defensively
* be vigilant for pedestrians walking along roadsides, including on major highways
* carefully plan any travel outside the capital
* use a four-wheel-drive vehicle if travelling outside of urban areas
* inspect rental vehicles thoroughly
* ensure the rental company provides assistance in case of mechanical problems
* pre-negotiate fares and schedules

### Public transportation

Buses, minibuses and trains operate between most major cities, but are unreliable. Safety standards are generally poor and petty crime is common.

#### Ferries

There are ferries connecting Albania with Italy and Greece. Weather conditions and strong winds may lead to cancellations or delays.

* Pay attention to pre-departure notices from your carrier
* Double-check the departure schedule before heading to the port

#### Taxis

Official taxis are generally safe.

* Use only officially marked taxis
* Negotiate fares in advance, or insist that the driver use the meter, as you may be overcharged
