# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Fuel shortages

Tonga is experiencing a fuel shortage. Local authorities have imposed rationing measures for fuel. These measures could affect:

* essential services
* tourism
* transportation

Keep a supply of fuel on hand and carefully plan all road travel.

### Crime

Petty crime, including theft, robberies, assaults and house break-ins, occurs. Thieves often target electronics.

During your trip:

* keep your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, in a secure place
* keep doors and windows locked at all times
* avoid walking alone after dark
* avoid isolated areas

### Women’s safety

Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment or verbal abuse.

Sexual assaults occur and foreign women have been targeted, including on public beaches.

* Always remain vigilant
* Avoid walking alone after dark
* Avoid unattended beaches

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations are rare but may occur. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Tourist facilities

Basic tourist facilities and services are available in Nuku’alofa but limited elsewhere.

### Adventure travel

Outdoor activities can be dangerous. Tour operators may not meet Canadian safety standards.

If you intend to participate in adventure tourism activities:

* share your itinerary with a friend or family member if you’re alone
* stay on marked trails and consider hiring an experienced guide from a reputable company
* obtain detailed information on your activity and the environment in which you will be setting out
* buy travel insurance that covers incidents related to these types of recreational activities
* ensure that you have proper equipment and bring sufficient water
* monitor weather conditions and other possible hazards

### Water activities

Rescue services may not be consistent with international standards.

#### Swimming

Coastal waters can be dangerous.

Rescue services may not meet Canadian safety standards.

Between June and November, whales are present in Tonga waters. Tongan law requires you to use a licenced boat and be accompanied by a certified guide to whale watch. Swimming or kayaking near whales can result in heavy fines and imprisonment.

Always follow the instructions and warnings of local authorities.

### Roads

Driving can be hazardous due to poor road conditions and inadequate lighting after dark. Streets in Nuku’alofa and main roads on Tongatapu are paved, but most others are not.

### Public transportation

Ferry accidents can occur due to the overloading and poor maintenance of some vessels.

Do not board vessels that appear overloaded or unseaworthy.

### Air travel

We don't make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.
