### Dress and behaviour

Tonga strictly observes the Sabbath. On Sundays, any recreational activity undertaken outside of island resorts may be seen as provocative.

To avoid offending local sensitivities:

* dress conservatively
* behave discreetly
* respect religious and social traditions

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Tongan law prohibits sexual acts between individuals of the same sex. Convicted offenders could face up to 10 years of imprisonment.

2SLGBTQI+ travellers should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Tonga.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Tonga.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Tonga, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Tonga.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Tonga by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Tonga to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.
