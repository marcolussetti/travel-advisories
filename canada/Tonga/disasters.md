## Natural disasters and climate

### Climate change

Climate change is affecting Tonga. Extreme and unusual weather events are becoming more frequent and may affect your travel plans. Monitor local media for the latest information.

### Tropical cyclones

Cyclones are more likely to occur between November and April, but major storms have occurred outside this period.

Severe storms can cause flooding and landslides, resulting in significant loss of life and extensive damage to infrastructure. They can put you at risk and hamper the provision of essential services.

During a tropical cyclone, hotel guests may be required to leave accommodations near the shore and move to safety centres inland. Travel to and from outer islands may be disrupted for days.

If you decide to travel to Tonga during cyclone season:

* know that you expose yourself to serious safety risks
* be prepared to change your travel plans on short notice, including cutting short or cancelling your trip
* stay informed of the latest regional weather forecasts
* carry emergency contact information for your airline or tour operator
* follow the advice and instructions of local authorities

### Earthquakes

Tonga is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and experiences regular seismic activity.

### Volcanoes

On July 3, 2024, the Home Reef Volcano started erupting. You should stay at least 5 km away from the volcano.

Parts of Tonga are still recovering from the impacts of the Hunga-Tonga Hunga-Ha'apai volcano that erupted on January 15, 2022, resulting in tsunami waves, ash fall, and significant damage to essential services and communications.

There are several volcanoes in Tonga. Debris from erupting volcanoes can clog rivers and cause them to overflow, resulting in flash floods and landslides. Ash clouds may also cause disruptions to domestic and international flights.

Eruptions may occur at any time. Series of tremors sometimes lead to evacuations of surrounding areas.

In the event of a volcanic eruption:

* monitor local media for the latest information
* follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders

If you are travelling near active volcanoes:

* monitor levels of volcanic activity through the local media
* pay careful attention to all warnings issued
* follow the advice of local authorities
* be prepared to modify your travel arrangements or even evacuate the area on short notice

### Tsunamis

Tonga is prone to tsunamis. A tsunami can occur within minutes of a nearby earthquake. However, the risk of a tsunami can remain for several hours following the first tremor.

If you're staying on the coast, in the event of a tsunami warning:

* familiarize yourself with the region's evacuation plans
* avoid affected areas
* follow the instructions of local authorities
