# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Crime

The crime rate is very low. Petty crime could occur.

Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times

### Landmines

Unexploded landmines dating back to 1982 remain on the Falkland Islands. All mine fields are fenced off with barbed wire and identified with red warning triangles. Don't enter the mine fields and don't damage or remove the fences or signs.

### Eco-tourism and recreational activities

Ensure that the recreational activities you choose are covered by your travel insurance.

If you intend on trekking:

* never trek alone
* always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* do not venture off marked trails
* ensure that you are properly equipped
* ensure that you are well informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary
* obtain detailed information on trekking routes before setting out

### Road safety

Road conditions are good, but many roads outside the capital are not paved. Strong winds pose a risk due to the unpaved roads. To be safe, rent a four-wheel drive vehicle.

### Public transportation

#### Buses

There are no public bus services, but a shuttle bus is available between Stanley and RAF Mount Pleasant Airport.

#### Taxis

Taxis are not widely available and don't have meters. Negotiate fares in advance as you may be overcharged.

#### Ferries

There is a passenger ferry in service between East and West Falkland.

### Air travel

We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.
