## Safety and security

### Crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, may occur.

Ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times.

### Water activities

#### Swimming

Lifeguards don’t usually supervise beaches. Tidal changes can cause powerful currents, and riptides are common.

Rescue services may not be consistent with international standards.

* Consult residents and tour operators for information on possible hazards and safe swimming areas
* Wear reef shoes to protect yourself against coral cuts and stonefish
* Follow the instructions and warnings of local authorities

#### Diving

Tour operators may not adhere to international standards.

If you undertake adventure sports, such as diving:

* choose a well-established and reputable company that has insurance
* ensure that your travel insurance covers the recreational activities you choose

In doubt concerning the safety of the installation or equipment, don’t use them
