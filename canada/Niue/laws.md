### Dress and behaviour

To avoid offending local sensitivities:

* dress conservatively
* behave discreetly

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

The law of Niue doesn’t criminalize sexual acts or relationships between individuals of the same sex.

However, 2SLGBTQI+ persons could be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or sex characteristics.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Niue.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Niue, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Niue.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Niue by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Niue to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

You must obtain a local driver’s licence from the police department to drive in Niue.

### Money

The currency in Niue is the New Zealand dollar (NZD). The economy is mostly cash-based.

Most businesses accept credit and debit cards issued by New Zealand banks. The Niue Tourism Visitor Information Centre also accepts all major credit cards for payment of accommodation, tours and some essential services. They may add a service surcharge.

You can obtain cash advances on New Zealand-issued credit cards at Kiwibank in Alofi. There’s also a Western Union agent for money transfers.
