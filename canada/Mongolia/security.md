# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs. This is common:

* in Ulaanbaatar and other major cities
* in popular tourist areas
* on public transportation
* in open-air markets
* at the central post office
* at the Gandantegchinlen Monastery
* at the State Department Store in Ulaanbaatar

While in Mongolia:

* Ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times.
* Exercise caution in crowded areas

There have been incidents of violent crime, such as assaults and robberies. Incidents occur more frequently in major cities. In Ulaanbaatar and other large cities such as Erdenet and Darkhan, be extra vigilant in the weeks leading up to and during major holidays, including:

* the Naadam Festival in July
* the Mongolian Lunar New Year (February 21- 23, 2023)
* International Women’s Day (March 8)
* Soldiers’ Day in March

Do not walk alone after dark.

Individuals posing as police officers have robbed foreigners, particularly in Ulaanbaatar’s Sukhbaatar Square area.

If approached, ask to see police credentials or offer to go to the police station.

Business travellers should be aware that foreign companies have received threats of violence.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations may occur. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

### Adventure tourism

Tour operators may not adhere to international standards.

If engaging in adventure tourism:

* never do so alone and always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that the recreational activities you choose are covered by your travel insurance.
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* ensure that you’re properly equipped and well informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary
* obtain detailed information on each activity before setting out and do not venture off marked trails
* do not use installation or equipment if you have any doubt about their safety

### Road travel

#### Road conditions

Roads between the capital city and provinces are poor. Driving can be hazardous, especially in rural areas where paved roads are limited. In Ulaanbaatar the number of vehicles and current transportation infrastructure produce chronic traffic jams.

Access to rural areas can be hampered by heavy snowfalls during the winter months.

If travelling to remote areas:

* Plan your journey
* Travel in a four-wheel-drive vehicle that is well-equipped with provisions, fuel and water
* Avoid driving after dark

#### Road safety

Traffic drives on the right but many cars have right-side steering. This can lead to collisions on two-lane roads when drivers attempt to pass slower vehicles.

* Drivers do not respect traffic laws and do not practice safe driving.
* Exercise caution while driving and anticipate potential hazards.

Accidents are common.

* Traffic laws are not consistently enforced.
* Drivers are sometimes aggressive and drinking and driving is prevalent.
* Use a GPS navigation system, if possible.

### Public transportation

#### Taxis

Taxi drivers have robbed passengers, sometimes violently. The use of “shared taxis” is discouraged because they are not reliable.

* Only use licensed taxis equipped with meters.
* When possible, book taxis through your hotel.

#### Buses

Pickpocketing is common on public buses. Overcrowding is common and women have reported inappropriate physical contact on buses.

#### Trains

The rail network in is limited. Thefts occur frequently on trains between Mongolia and Russia.
