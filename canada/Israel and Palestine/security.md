## Safety and security

### Tensions in the Middle East

There are ongoing tensions in the region. Hostilities could resume with little or no warning. During previous attacks, missiles, drones and other projectiles have struck targets in Israel and Palestine.

Ben Gurion International Airport is open to commercial flights. However, ongoing tensions could result in:

* travel disruptions, including flight cancellations and airspace closures
* military debris falling in various locations.

Land border crossings with Jordan and Egypt remain open. For West Bank ID holders, the Allenby/King Hussein bridge near Jericho is the only available exit option. You must obtain a visa in advance before crossing.

You should:

* monitor local and international media to stay informed of the rapidly evolving situation
* follow the instructions of local authorities at all times
* be vigilant and prepared to shelter in place
* Register or update your contact information with the [Registration of Canadians abroad](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/registration) service to receive the latest information from the Government of Canada

If you encounter any debris or fragments:

* move away from them immediately
* contact local authorities

### Military operations in the Gaza Strip

On October 7, 2023, terrorists based in the Gaza Strip carried out a large-scale terrorist attack in Israel, resulting in thousands of casualties. Subsequently, Israel launched a military offensive into the Gaza Strip. The operation has resulted in tens of thousands of civilian casualties and led to significant damage to civilian infrastructure, such as hospitals and schools.

Your safety is at high risk throughout the Gaza Strip due to the ongoing military operations.

Ongoing hostilities and the limited entry of humanitarian aid have led to severe shortages of basic supplies and widespread disruptions to essential services throughout the Gaza Strip, including:

* water and food supply
* power distribution
* telecommunications networks
* emergency services
* medical care and supplies

Military action in the Gaza Strip could further disrupt key infrastructure and transportation routes and limit the provision of essential services throughout the territory.

Travel in and out of the Gaza Strip is extremely limited, including for humanitarian assistance and evacuations.

Due to infrastructure damage, connectivity in the Gaza Strip may be unstable or unavailable. If possible, try to register or update your personal information through the [Registration of Canadians Abroad service](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/registration) to receive the latest information, including about departure options. If you are unable to do so, try to contact Global Affairs Canada's 24/7 [Emergency Watch and Response Centre](https://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-assistance?_ga=2.93069341.168187391.1696947682-2043183889.1686925125).

### Tensions and violence in the West Bank

Tensions and violence remain high in the West Bank.

Violent clashes between extremist Israeli settlers and Palestinians occur frequently in several areas, with civilians frequently targeted, injured, or killed.

Israeli military operations in cities and villages are also frequent, often resulting in injuries and deaths.

Israeli military operations in cities and villages are also frequent, often resulting in injuries and deaths.

These operations occur most frequently in:

* Hebron
* Jenin
* Nablus
* Jericho
* Ramallah
* Bir Zei
* Bethlehem
* Tulkarem
* Qalqiliy

Movement restrictions are in place throughout the West Bank, including curfews and Israeli checkpoints, where the risk of violent confrontation is heightened. Areas near the barrier separating Israel and the West Bank are particularly high-risk.

Violence also often occurs along main roads and intersections where passing vehicles may be subject to random stops at checkpoints or targeted with stone-throwing and other forms of vandalism.

Individuals of Palestinian or Arab descent may be subject to increased scrutiny, detention, or arrest. Personal electronic devices may be searched at Israeli military checkpoints, including flying checkpoints.

You, your friends, and your family members could face detention, arrest, and/or the suspension or withdrawal of your official permits if you share information deemed to be inaccurate and sensitive by Israel. This includes content shared on social media such as political opinions. Be conscious of these potential consequences if you discuss political views online.

If you are in or travelling to the West Bank despite the advisory in effect:

* assess if you are currently in a safe location and consider alternate travel arrangements in case of a rapid deterioration in the security situation
* shelter in place if you can't leave the area safely
* imit your movements and avoid travelling at night
* remain extremely cautious
* monitor local and international media to get the latest information
* try to keep your phone charged
* register through the [Registration of Canadians Abroad service](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/registration)

### Naval blockade of the Gaza Strip

The security situation along the Mediterranean coast of the Gaza Strip remains dangerous. The Israeli Navy regularly patrols the area and the Israeli security forces continue to intercept attempts to breach Israel's naval blockade.

These incidents have resulted in:

* deaths
* injuries
* arrests
* deportations

In cases of deportation, local authorities are not obliged to notify the Canadian Embassy in Tel Aviv nor the Representative Office of Canada in Ramallah.  As a result, Canadian officials may not be able to provide you with consular assistance.

* Avoid travelling to the Gaza Strip
* Don't attempt to break the naval blockade

#### Border areas

Border areas with Israel are particularly dangerous and heavily guarded. Landmines are present in certain areas along Israel's borders. Some minefields have not been clearly marked or fenced.

All Palestinian border areas, including those with Israel, are tightly controlled by Israeli authorities who restrict access and conduct frequent security operations.

#### Syria

Militant activity close to the Israeli barrier in the Golan Heights makes the area extremely dangerous and unstable.

Despite the United Nations-monitored buffer zone between Israel and Syria in the Golan Heights, cross-border gunfire and rocket fires occur with little or no warning. The Israel Defence Forces also conduct military operations in the area, including air strikes.

* Don't approach the Israeli barrier along the border with Syria in the Golan Heights
* Monitor local media for information on the latest incidents
* Don't travel east of Highway 98 except to the following cities:

+ Buq'ata
+ Mas'ada
+ Majdal
+ Ghajar

#### Egypt

The border area with Egypt is dangerous due to military operations and smuggling activities.

The Israeli Defence Forces regularly patrols the area to intercept drug smugglers resulting in frequent armed clashes.

The Rafah border crossing, which is the only option to cross between the Gaza Strip and Egypt, is controlled jointly by Egyptian and Israeli authorities. It has been closed since May 2024 due to the ongoing conflict in the Gaza Strip. There have been several strikes on the city of Rafah before and after the border crossing closure. In northern Sinai, the security situation can also deteriorate rapidly due to instability and the risk of terrorist attacks.

Don't drive on:

* Highway 10
* Highway 12
* south of the intersection of highways 10 and 12
* between Eilat and the Netafim passage

The highways are subject to closure by Israeli authorities without warning.

If you're planning to travel near the border with Egypt despite this advisory:

* expect roadblocks and checkpoints
* be aware of your surroundings
* monitor local media to determine where military activity is occurring

#### Lebanon

There is no official international border between Israel and Lebanon. The United Nations observe the “Blue Line,” which separates the two countries, in addition to a fence constructed by Israel on its side of the Blue line. There are sporadic clashes between Israeli and Lebanese armies patrolling along the Blue line.

Landmines are present in the area.

Terrorist groups based in southern Lebanon have fired a significant number of rockets and missiles from Lebanon into northern Israel in response to the ongoing military operations in the Gaza Strip, resulting in air strikes by the Israel Defence Forces. On November 27, 2024, a ceasefire took effect between Israel and Lebanon, but hostilities could resume at any time.

Rockets fired from Lebanon have targeted areas near several cities in northern Israel and Palestine, including:

* Haifa
* Kiryat Shmona
* Shlomi
* Metula
* Metzuba
* Betzet
* Hanita
* Idmit
* Deir Istiya

There are ongoing military operations in the following areas:

* Kfar Shouba Hills
* Shebaa Farms

If you choose to travel near the border with Lebanon despite this advisory:

* remain cautious at all times
* monitor local media for any active security alerts
* follow the advice of local authorities

### Jerusalem

Confrontations and clashes can occur in areas of Jerusalem, including parts of the Old City. Jerusalem has also seen an increased number of terrorist attacks targeting civilians.

During periods of imposed movement restrictions and on religious holidays, exacerbated tensions can lead to security incidents.

There are periodic clashes near Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif, including around Al-Aqsa Mosque, especially during Ramadan.

* Avoid travel to the Old City during periods of exacerbated tensions
* Travel in groups
* Always dress conservatively

Due to recent events in Israel, West Bank and the Gaza Strip, local authorities may close or restrict access to checkpoints in and around Jerusalem.

### Politically motivated violence

Politically motivated violence occurs regularly throughout Israel and Palestine.

Previous incidents resulting in injuries and deaths include:

* stabbings
* shootings
* mob violence
* vehicle ramming
* stone-throwing at vehicles
* arbitrary arrests and detentions

During your stay:

* be aware of your surroundings at all times
* monitor news reports
* follow the instructions of local authorities

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in Israel. There have been several deadly attacks targeting civilians.

Terrorist incidents causing numerous deaths and injuries have occurred in a variety of locations, including:

* Beersheba
* Eilat
* Haifa
* Jerusalem
* Netanya
* Tel Aviv

Further attacks are likely.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

Be particularly vigilant during:

* sporting events
* public celebrations
* religious holidays, such as:

+ Rosh Hashanah
+ Yom Kippur
+ Pesach (Passover)
+ Ramadan

Terrorists may use such occasions to mount attacks.

There is a threat of terrorism in Palestine, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, where several terrorist groups are active.

In the West Bank, attacks mainly target Israeli settlers, Israeli security forces, rival Palestinian groups or the Palestinian Authority’s security forces. There are also attacks between different factions in and around refugee camps.

Terrorists typically launch attacks from the Gaza Strip towards Israel and Israel’s Defence Forces, which often lead to violent spillovers. Attacks are unpredictable and often involve the following types of weapons and/or devices:

* improvised explosive devices (IEDs)
* vehicle-borne IEDs
* rockets and mortars
* assault weapons

Further attacks are likely.

### Rocket fire

Cities across Israel may be targeted by rocket fire from the Gaza Strip or missile and rocket fire from Lebanon.

Rockets fired from and towards the Gaza Strip have reached areas in its periphery.

### Crime

The crime rate is relatively low in Israel and Palestine. Despite an important presence of security personnel in major cities, petty crime may still occur in urban and touristic areas and on beaches.

There have been reports of:

* pickpocketing
* purse snatching
* theft of passports, credit cards and other valuables

There's an increase in car thefts.

During your stay:

* make sure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* make sure that your wallet, money and valuables are out of sight, particularly in crowded tourist areas
* avoid carrying large amounts of cash
* avoid showing signs of affluence
* don't leave luggage or valuables in a vehicle and always park your vehicle in secure facilities
* keep your car doors locked and windows closed at all times

### Demonstrations and strikes

Planned and unplanned demonstrations occur regularly.

In Israel, demonstrators frequently gather to express opposition to the government in place. These demonstrations and strikes often result in disruptions to services and public transportation. They sometimes lead to violent incidents, such as vandalism and clashes between demonstrators and police. Security forces sometimes use tear gas and water cannons to disperse crowds.

In the West Bank, demonstrations occur on or around religious holidays and mostly in response to ongoing events throughout the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. They often lead to clashes between demonstrators and local security forces, as well as with the Israeli security forces. Excessive force has been used to disperse crowds, including tear gas, water cannons, rubber bullets, stun grenades and live ammunition.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Roads

#### Road conditions

Most roads in Israel are in good condition. Roads in the Gaza Strip are severely damaged due to the ongoing conflict and military operations. In the West Bank, roads are generally in poor condition.

During the winter months, precipitation can cause difficult driving conditions and road closures across the territory.

Driving may also be dangerous due to:

* traffic jams and heavy traffic
* narrow, winding and mountainous roads
* flash floods in some regions

#### Driving habits

There is a high rate of road accidents due to dangerous driving habits across Israel and Palestine. Drivers often drive at excessive speed and don’t always respect the right of way, especially in roundabouts.

It's mandatory to have a high visibility vest and a warning triangle kit in your car. If you must stop on the side of the road and get out of your car, you must wear the vest and use the triangles according to the safety instructions provided.

If you plan to drive:

* always drive defensively
* plan your trip in advance, especially if you are visiting a rural area
* always carry a cell phone and charger
* familiarize yourself with the route before you travel

### Checkpoints

There are security checkpoints, mainly within the West Bank and along its barrier with Israel.

The Israel Defence Forces control access to the West Bank through a series of security checkpoints and the Palestinian Authority police may do so within their jurisdiction. Following incidents of politically motivated violence, the government of Israel may also establish additional checkpoints without warning and increase the intensity of vehicle checks. Additional measures may include frequent and extended closures of checkpoints at the discretion of Israeli Security Forces.

Officers may ask to see your valid documents. There is no guarantee that you may pass through security checkpoints even if you have a valid visa and authorization to enter.

During periods of religious holidays, checkpoint and border-crossing hours of operation are subject to change.

If travelling by car during your stay:

* expect multiple roadblocks and checkpoints
* be prepared to present your identification documents
* don't pass through checkpoints without stopping, even if they appear unattended
* follow instructions of police or military officers if you get stopped

### Public transportation

#### Buses

The bus system is reliable in Israel. However, violent incidents and terrorist attacks occur occasionally in public buses and at bus stops. Attacks have resulted in deaths and injuries in the past.

If you're travelling by bus during your stay:

* be aware of your surroundings at all times
* stay behind bollards or behind the bus stop while waiting
* stand away from large groups of people
* notify the driver of any suspicious objects or persons

#### Trains

The Israeli train network is extensive. It covers most of the territory and links major cities, such as Tel Aviv, Haifa, and Jerusalem. This network does not cover the Gaza Strip and parts of the West Bank. In order to access train stations, you will have to pass a security check.

Trains in Israel are generally modern, clean and frequent.

If you're travelling by train:

* be vigilant
* avoid travelling alone at night
* allow extra time to go through security checks
* validate your ticket to avoid fines

#### Taxis

Taxis are generally reliable in Israel and the West Bank. In the West Bank, they are the easiest way of moving around.

Mobile applications are also available.

If you're taking a taxi:

* never share them with strangers
* negotiate the fare in advance
* avoid travelling alone at night
