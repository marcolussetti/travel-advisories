## Entry and exit requirements

On September 23, 2025, Israeli authorities announced that the Allenby/King Hussein Bridge border crossing would remain closed until further notice.

[For more information on travel to and from Jordan](#traveljordan)

The authorities of a country or territory decide who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the authorities of Israel and Palestine. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 90 days beyond the date of entry into Israel, the West Bank or the Gaza Strip.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with a “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

You should also be aware that current systems used by some countries and travel companies may not recognize the “X” gender identifier. You may still be asked to provide your sex/gender information as either male or female when travelling.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Visas

#### Palestine

Palestine does not issue its own visas. To enter Palestine, travellers must pass through Israeli ports of entry and comply with Israeli entry requirements.

#### Israel

Tourist visa: not required for stays of up to 90 days  
Business visa: not required  
Student visa: not required  
Work visa: required

Travellers from visa-exempt countries, including Canada, need to obtain an ETA-IL (electronic travel authorization) to enter Israel. You should submit your electronic application at least 72 hours before your expected arrival date in Israel.

If your ETA-IL application is approved, you can enter Israel and stay for a period of up to 90 days.

[ETA-IL](https://www.gov.il/en/departments/topics/eta-il/govil-landing-page#:~:text=The%20Israeli%20Population%20and%20Immigration,to%2090%20days%20or%20less) – Israeli Population and Immigration Authority

### Entry card

The Government of Israel issues an entry card on arrival.

You will need this card to enter the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. However, due to the ongoing conflict, entry to and exit from the Gaza Strip is extremely limited.

Keep it in a secure place to avoid complications upon leaving Israel.

### Land travel restrictions

The Government of Israel tightly controls checkpoint crossings within the West Bank and to the Gaza Strip.

Security-related closures can severely restrict entry to and exit from these areas, even for persons possessing valid entry and exit permits.

Large crowds may gather due to:

* limited hours of operations
* unannounced travel restrictions
* extended closures

This may increase risks to your personal safety.

### Travel to and from West Bank

The West Bank is divided into three administrative divisions, which fall under varying degrees of administrative and security control between Palestinian and Israeli authorities.

Israel sets out the entry and exit requirements for the West Bank. In some circumstances, Israeli authorities may deny you entry into the West Bank.

You are required to obtain permits with strict conditions for:

* short-term visits
* professional, academic or volunteering purposes
* temporary residence for spouses

These new procedures apply to all foreign nationals. As a result, you may need a specific type of visa to enter the West Bank based on your purpose of travel.

If you intend to travel to the West Bank:

* contact Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the closest Israeli embassy to find out which type of permit you need to apply for
* ensure that you have the proper and up-to-date identification, travel documentation and authorization to obtain your permit
* plan your visit accordingly and apply well in advance to avoid delays.

### Travel to and from Gaza Strip

The Erez border crossing, controlled by Israel, is currently closed. The Rafah border crossing, controlled by both Egypt and Israel, has been closed since May 2024. Due to the ongoing conflict, entry to and exit from the Gaza Strip is extremely limited.

### Travel to and from Jordan

As a Canadian citizen, you may travel to and from Jordan through the following border crossings:

* Jordan River/Sheikh Hussein Bridge, in the north of Israel (visa available on arrival)
* Allenby/King Hussein Bridge, near Jericho in the West Bank (visa required prior to crossing the border)
* Yitzak/Aqaba, near Eilat in the south of Israel (visa available on arrival)

The security situation may result in disruptions to movement and transportation, including border closures or restrictions, especially in the West Bank. These restrictions could make it difficult to reach the Allenby border crossing, which is the only exit option for West Bank ID holders, even if you have a Canadian passport. If you don’t have a West Bank ID, you can use the other border crossings.

### Dual citizenship

#### Israeli-Canadians

Canadians who were born outside Israel to a mother or father who is an Israeli citizen may be considered citizens of Israel.

Israeli law requires Israeli citizens to:

* enter and exit the country on an Israeli passport
* show proof of military status upon arrival

If you are unsure of your Israeli citizenship or your military status, verify it through the Embassy of Israel to Canada or an Israeli consulate before leaving Canada.

#### Palestinian-Canadians

As a Palestinian-Canadian citizen, you may be subject to Government of Israel travel regulations for Palestinians. Strict border control policies may prevent you from entering to and exiting from:

* Israel
* Jerusalem;
* the West Bank
* the Gaza Strip

Anyone registered in the Government of Israel’s West Bank and Gaza Strip population registries, including Canadian passport holders of Palestinian descent born in the West Bank or Gaza after 1967, is prohibited from entering Israel through Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion International Airport.

Israeli authorities are currently only allowing a limited number of Palestinians to enter into the West Bank via the Allenby Crossing (King Hussein Bridge). This rule may not apply to Palestinians with dual citizenship.

You may also be subject to the Government of Israel’s travel regulations for Palestinians if you are a Canadian born in another Arab state or if you hold dual Canadian-Arab state citizenship.

Israeli authorities may then ask you to enter and exit Israel on your Arab passport.

If the place of birth listed on the traveller’s passport does not have diplomatic relations with Israel, travellers may be subject to increased security screening at points of entry, including extensive questioning, physical searches and/or denial of entry, which can involve temporary detention before removal.

### Regional travel

Some Canadians have been denied entry into Lebanon, Syria and other Arab countries because their passports bore:

* an Israeli visa
* an Egyptian or Jordanian border stamp issued by an office bordering Israel

### Other entry requirement

Custom officials may ask to show a return or onward ticket as proof that you have sufficient funds to cover your stay.
