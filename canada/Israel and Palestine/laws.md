## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Transfer to a Canadian prison

Canada and Israel are signatories to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in Israel to request a transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both Canadian and Israeli authorities.

This process can take a long time, and there is no guarantee that the transfer will be approved by either or both sides.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs, are severe. Convicted offenders can expect jail sentences and fines.

### Alcohol

Although alcohol consumption in public is illegal in the Gaza Strip, you can drink alcohol in certain areas in the West Bank. Avoid drinking alcohol outside licensed premises in the West Bank.

### Photography

Photography of sensitive installations is prohibited. This includes:

* military sites
* police personnel and installations

Seek permission before taking photos of people in Muslim or Orthodox Jewish areas.

### Dual citizenship

Both the Palestinian and Israeli authorities recognize dual citizenship. If you hold or used to hold a Palestinian ID card, you may be considered a Palestinian national while in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip or Israel.

Foreign nationals naturalized citizens of Israel must forfeit their previous citizenship.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Israel or Palestine, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different entry/exit requirements.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Israel.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Israel, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Israeli court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Israel to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

The Hague Convention does not apply between Canada and the State of Palestine.

#### Religious holidays

Some Jewish, Christian and Muslim communities' customs, laws and regulations adhere closely to religious practices and beliefs.

Tensions between religious groups are higher during religious holidays and may lead to violence.

There is a risk of assault if you travel by car in the Old City of Jerusalem and conservative neighbourhoods of Israel during Shabbat.

To avoid offending local sensitivities, especially during religious holidays:

* dress conservatively
* behave discreetly
* respect social and religious traditions
* seek permission from people and local authorities before taking photographs

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Israeli law doesn’t criminalize sexual acts or relationships between persons of the same sex.

Same-sex consensual acts are legal in Jerusalem and the West Bank.

2SLGBTQI+ persons could still be discriminated against or victims of harassment and/or violence based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or sex characteristics.

The Gaza Strip’s law criminalizes sexual acts and relationships between persons of the same sex.

2SLGBTQI+ persons could be detained based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or sex characteristics.

They may also be detained and face other charges such as:

* cross-dressing
* gross indecency
* offence to public morals

2SLGBTQI+ persons could face up to 10 years of imprisonment. They should carefully consider the risks of travelling to the Gaza Strip.

### Driving

You may drive in Israel using your Canadian driver’s license for up to 12 months.

Vehicles with Palestinian licence plates are not permitted to enter Israel unless granted a permit by Israeli authorities in advance. If you are planning to enter the West Bank with a rented vehicle, verify your insurance coverage and permissions with your car rental agency.

You should carry an International Driving Permit.

### Money

The currency of Israel is the Israeli Shekel (ILS).

Palestine does not have an official currency, but the Jordanian Dinar (JOD), the Israeli Shekel (NIS) and the U.S. Dollar (USD) are all accepted.

ATMs are available in Israel and the West Bank, but may not accept Canadian cards. The banking system in the West Bank is fragile and mainly relies on card payments for day-to-day transactions.

In Gaza, there are no ATMs or banks. The only form of payment is cash.
