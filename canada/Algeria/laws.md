## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Penalties for breaking the law in Algeria can be more severe than in Canada, even for similar offences. No transfer of offenders treaty exists between Canada and Algeria. If you’re convicted of a serious crime, you must serve your jail sentence in Algeria. You may also have to remain in Algeria for a parole period after your release.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect a jail sentence and a heavy fine.

#### Alcohol

The consumption of alcohol in public is illegal.

Avoid drinking alcohol outside licensed premises.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Algerian law criminalizes sexual acts and relationships between persons of the same sex. 2SLGBTQI+ persons may also be charged with offences of indecency or other related offences.

2SLGBTQI+ persons could also be discriminated against or detained based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or sex characteristics. Convicted offenders could face up to 3 years of imprisonment and heavy fines.

2SLGBTQI+ persons should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Algeria.

### Death penalty

Although capital punishment has not been applied since 1993, you may still face the death penalty if you’re found guilty of serious offences.

### Dress and behaviour

Algerian customs, laws and regulations adhere closely to Islamic practices and beliefs.

Public displays of affection, including holding hands and kissing, are not socially accepted.

Foreign female travellers are not expected to wear head covers. However, revealing clothing is considered inappropriate.

To avoid offending local sensitivities:

* dress conservatively
* behave discreetly
* respect religious and social traditions
* seek permission from locals before photographing them

### Ramadan

In 2026, the lunar month of Ramadan is expected to begin on or around February 17.

In public, between sunrise and sunset, be discreet when:

* drinking
* eating
* smoking

### Religious proselytism

Religious proselytism is illegal.

You should avoid engaging in religious activities that contradict or challenge Islamic teachings and values. This includes preaching, possessing, or distributing religious literature or material.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Algeria.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of Algeria, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

[Dual citizens](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/documents/dual-citizenship)

Algerian authorities have prevented dual Canadian-Algerian citizens from leaving Algeria after they took part in demonstrations or made political comments on social media.

Be aware of the possibility of surveillance and potential repercussions if you discuss the political situation in public or online.

### Mandatory military service

Algerian men over the age of 19 are subject to mandatory military service.

Local authorities may prevent you from leaving the country if you’re a dual Canadian-Algerian citizen and are unable to produce either:

* a deferment card exempting you from military service
* a certificate of census registration
* evidence that you have completed your military service

Obtain a document certifying your status from the Embassy of Algeria before travel.

### Family law

Algerian family law is different from Canadian family law. Decisions are based on Islamic law. Children of an Algerian father automatically acquire Algerian citizenship at birth.

If you are involved in a custody dispute in Algeria, consult an Algerian lawyer for advice and assistance regarding your specific situation.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Algeria.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Algeria by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Algeria to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.
