# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Border areas

Border areas often see greater criminal activity and violence.

Algeria's security concerns are mainly due to regional instability. There is a heightened risk of kidnapping and terrorist attacks in rural, mountainous, border and remote desert areas of North Africa. Extremist groups take advantage of porous borders to carry out attacks. They operate human, drug and weapons trafficking in these areas, contributing to the overall threat.

Terrorist groups and extremist militants are especially active along the borders with:

* Mali
* Niger
* Libya
* Tunisia
* Mauritania

The border with Morocco has remained closed since 1994. Tensions are high in this region.

Although counterterrorism operations should limit the ability of militants to carry out large-scale attacks, you should avoid all travel to border areas.

### Terrorism

There’s a constant terrorist threat across North Africa. Reports of planned terrorist attacks occasionally emerge.

In recent years, the Algerian government has intensified its fight against terrorists. Counterterrorism operations significantly diminished the capacity of terrorist groups to operate in Algeria. However, militants remain in the country even if attacks are less common. They mainly target security forces, local government, and Western interests. Terrorist activity in Libya, Mali, Niger, and Tunisia contributes to the overall threat, particularly in border regions.

Despite these efforts, terrorist attacks could occur at any time. Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

Be particularly vigilant during the following:

* sporting events
* religious holidays
* public celebrations
* major political events, such as elections

Terrorists could use such occasions to mount attacks.

### Kidnapping

There’s a threat of kidnapping, mostly in remote, isolated and border areas.

Should you plan to travel to remote areas despite the risks:

* be vigilant at all times
* always carry your cellphone and charger
* use only major roads and highways
* vary your itineraries and schedules
* consider hiring a reputable guide who knows the area well
* stay at hotels that have strong security measures

### Demonstrations and strikes

Demonstrations may occur. Political, social and economic tensions caused civil unrest throughout the country in the past. Security forces are highly visible and may use tear gas or other tactics to disperse crowds.

Even peaceful demonstrations can suddenly turn violent at any time. They can also lead to traffic and public transportation disruptions, causing road closures and delays.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Political activism

Over the past year, the Algerian government increased the number of arrests of activists, including some associated with the Hirak popular protest movement, which began in Algeria in February 2019.

Algerian authorities have also prevented dual Canadian-Algerian citizens from leaving Algeria after they were identified as politically engaged in Canada.

Participating in demonstrations or political activities, including on social media, may prevent you from leaving the country.

Exercise great care when interacting online, even when you are outside of Algeria.

### Crime

The crime rate is moderate in Algeria. Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs, especially in larger cities after dark. Armed robberies may also occur.

* Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Be aware of your surroundings
* Keep a low profile
* Never walk alone and avoid travelling after dark
* Don’t show signs of affluence
* Carry only small amounts of cash
* Avoid using your smartphone or camera in public
* Don’t resist if robbers threaten you

If you are travelling by car:

* keep your windows closed and doors locked at all times
* if possible, travel in a convoy
* use secure parking facilities
* never leave belongings unattended in a vehicle, even in the trunk

### Romance scams

Internet romance scams via dating websites or social media have occurred.

If you are travelling to Algeria to meet an online contact:

* keep in mind that you may be the victim of a scam
* be wary of people who profess friendship or romantic interest over the internet

### Women's safety

Women travelling alone may be subject to certain forms of harassment and verbal abuse.

Sexual harassment and assaults have occurred.

To avoid being the target of harassment, women should:

* dress conservatively
* avoid walking alone
* travel in groups
* travel during daylight hours only
* sit in the back seat of taxis

### Adventure tourism

Desert expeditions or trekking can be dangerous, especially if they are not well organized. Trails are not always marked, and weather conditions can change rapidly.

If you undertake desert expeditions:

* never do so alone
* always hiring an experienced guide from a reputable company
* travel in a 4 x 4 vehicle
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* don’t venture off marked trails
* ensure that you’re properly equipped and carry sufficient water supply
* know the symptoms of dehydration and heatstroke, both of which can be fatal
* stay informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary, including when you expect to be back
* obtain detailed information on the activity before setting out

### Water shortages

Water shortages occur regularly, especially from April to October. This is mainly due to fast-growing demand affecting the provision of essential services. They may trigger demonstrations.

Keep reserve supplies of water on hand.

### Road safety

Road safety can vary greatly throughout the country. Accidents are common.

#### Road conditions

Road conditions have significantly improved in recent years. However, they can be poor outside of Algiers. In desert regions, rough roads require 4 x 4 vehicles.

Driving can also be dangerous due to the following:

* narrow, winding, and mountainous roads
* slippery roads and winter conditions in the northern part of the country
* sand-laden winds in the southern part of the country
* heavy traffic and congestion, especially in urban areas
* potholes and unpaved roads
* poorly maintained vehicles

#### Driving habits

Drivers don’t always respect traffic laws. They often drive at excessive speeds. They may be aggressive and reckless. Texting and driving is also a common practice.

If you plan on travelling by car in Algeria, you should consider renting a car with a hired driver rather than driving yourself. If you choose to drive:

* always drive defensively
* plan your trip ahead of time, especially if you visit a rural area
* avoid road travel at night
* use only main roads and highways
* avoid stopping in isolated areas
* keep your car doors locked and the windows closed at all times

#### Checkpoints

Checkpoints on roads heading into and out of larger cities and on roads throughout Algiers are common.

Don’t go through checkpoints without stopping, even if they appear unattended.

### Public transportation

#### Metro

The Algiers metro is safe and reliable to use during daytime.

#### Buses

Buses are unreliable. They are rarely on time, especially during rush hours. Some public and private vehicles are poorly maintained. They are often the site of petty theft, armed robbery and sexual harassment incidents.

* Don’t use local or intercity public buses
* Use only reputable tour operators

#### Taxis

Hotel-associated taxis are considered safe.

They generally only serve city centres. They may be limited in availability, particularly late at night and during peak hours.

* Avoid boarding taxis at taxi stands or flagging taxis in the street
* If using hotel taxis, request the service at the front desk
* When travelling by air, pre-arrange your pickup with your hotel before your arrival or use authorized airport taxis
* Note the driver's name on the picture identification badge, as well as the licence number
* Never share a taxi with strangers
* Make sure the driver doesn’t pick up other passengers along the way to your destination
* Negotiate the fare in advance
* Have small bills available for payment

#### Ridesharing apps

Most vehicles used by these drivers are in poor condition.

Travellers have also reported that vehicle information and drivers' name rarely match the information they receive when using some ridesharing apps in Algeria.
