## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Transfer to a Canadian prison

Canada and Moldova are signatories to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in Moldova to request a transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both Canadian and Moldovan authorities.

This process can take a long time, and there is no guarantee that the transfer will be approved by either or both sides.

### Identification

You must always carry photo identification, such as a passport, as police are entitled to request it at any time. If you fail to produce valid identification when requested to do so by authorities, you could face detention or fines.

Keep a photocopy of your passport in a safe place in case it’s lost or confiscated.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Moldova.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Moldova, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Moldova.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Moldova, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Moldovan court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Moldova to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Exports

Strict regulations are in place regarding the export of antiques, artwork and items of historical Moldovan significance. If you purchased any works of art or antiques, confirm with the Moldovan Department of Monuments if you may leave Moldova with these items before attempting to leave. Proof of the approval may be requested at the point of departure. Heavy fines or charges may be imposed if you fail to provide proof of approval to export.

### Money

The currency of Moldova is the Moldovan leu (MDL). Euros are accepted.

Credit cards are increasingly being accepted, but the economy is primarily cash-based.

Local currency ATMs are available in Chisinau, but only a few accept foreign bank cards.

Banks and services in Transnistria will not accept foreign credit or debit cards. Transnistria uses a separate currency from Moldova, the Transnistrian ruble. Leu are not accepted in Transnistria, and you can only exchange foreign currency to Transnistrian ruble within Transnistria. The breakaway government in Transnistria considers all payments made in foreign currencies to be illegal.
