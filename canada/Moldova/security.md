## Safety and security

### Impacts of the armed conflict in Ukraine

In February 2022, Russia began a military invasion of Ukraine, which shares a land border with Moldova.

The Russian military invasion of Ukraine has increased political tensions in Moldova. The security situation could deteriorate rapidly. Projectiles from the armed conflict in Ukraine have passed through Moldovan airspace and debris has landed in areas near the Ukrainian border.

There is a risk of demonstrations and civil unrest. The situation could deteriorate rapidly.

If you are currently in Moldova or are planning to visit in the future:

* always be aware of your surroundings, especially near the border with Ukraine
* follow the instructions of local authorities
* monitor trustworthy news sources to stay informed on the evolving situation

### Transnistria

Transnistria is a separatist region outside the Moldovan government’s control. It is located in Eastern Moldova between the eastern bank of the Dnieper River and the Ukrainian border. The security situation is unstable and unpredictable, especially since the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The breakaway government in Transnistria exercises strict control over public assembly and demonstrations. Our ability to provide consular services in Transnistria is severely limited.

If you choose to travel to Transnistria despite the advisory:

* monitor trustworthy news sources to stay informed on the evolving situation
* expect unofficial checkpoints and long delays on the roads between this region and the rest of Moldova
* follow the instructions of local authorities
* keep your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, in a secure place

### Roads

#### Road conditions

Roads are poorly maintained, and most are not well lit. Poor signage and a lack of maintenance pose risks. Farm vehicles, livestock and other similar hazards regularly disrupt road traffic. It is common to see tractors, bicyclists, horse-drawn carts, pedestrians and livestock on the same road.

#### Driving habits

Drivers can be aggressive. Drinking and driving is common and accidents are common. Be cautious when crossing streets, as drivers do not always give pedestrians the right of way.

Avoid driving after dark.

### Public transportation

Taxi availability may be limited, especially outside city centres. Only use officially marked taxis, including at the airport. Establish a rate or a fixed price before starting the journey to avoid excessive fees.

* Ask for your cab at the front desk if you’re using hotel services
* Avoid flagging taxis on the street
* Never share a taxi with strangers
* Confirm the driver's identity and license plate before getting into the car

Bus accidents are common. Most public transportation vehicles are old and poorly maintained.
