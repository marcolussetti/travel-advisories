# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Political Situation

Following the death of the president of Chad in 2021, the Parliament was dissolved and a Transitional Military Council (TMC) was put in place. In October 2022, violent protests related to the ongoing political transition led to clashes with security forces. The events resulted in casualties, including in the city of N’Djamena.

While the situation is currently calm, the potential for political, social or economic unrest remains very high and there is a growing anti-foreigner sentiment across the country. The situation could deteriorate very quickly and without warning.

### Border with Sudan and the Central African Republic

In the border areas with Sudan and the Central African Republic, rebel groups are active and create an extremely insecure situation. Attacks have occurred in these areas and there is a serious threat of kidnapping against foreigners.

There’s an ongoing risk for trans-border clashes in eastern Chad (including the Biltine and Ouaddaï provinces). Violent incidents have been reported ins the city of Abéché and its surroundings. There are live minefields in these regions. Crossing these borders anywhere is extremely dangerous.

If you are in these regions despite the advisory in effect:

* travel in convoys of at least two vehicles
* avoid all movements after 6 p.m.

### Border with Niger

The situation in Chad has been tense since the attempted military coup in Niger on  July 26, 2023. The regions bordering Niger could be particularly affected by any further deterioration of the political situation in Niger.

* Avoid all travel to areas bordering Niger
* Monitor local and international media to stay informed on the evolving situation
* Follow the instructions of local authorities

### Border with Nigeria and Cameroon

Several deadly attacks occurred in the region of Lac, including some on the islands in Lac Tchad. Rural areas around Lac Tchad are also subject to periodic violence.

Contraband from Cameroon is frequently smuggled across the Chari River, which can result in armed intervention by Chadian customs and river police.

### N’Djamena

Terrorist attacks have been committed in N’Djamena. Due to incidences of crime, it is not recommended to walk in N’Djamena, even during the day. Armed robberies occur, often in the vicinity of restaurants in N’Djamena. In some cases, foreigners were targeted and injured. If travel outside N’Djamena is necessary, a permit issued by the Ministry of Interior is required. The permit may take several days to be issued.

### Northern Chad

Travel in northern Chad, especially in the Borkou, Ennedi and Tibesti provinces, is dangerous. There are landmines along the border with Libya. Attempting to cross the border would be hazardous.

The land border between Libya and Chad is closed until further notice.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations take place regularly. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

Preventive and restrictive measures on freedom of assembly throughout the country are currently in effect. These measures aim to limit the organization of and participation in gatherings and demonstrations in public places. Police may use various means to disperse gatherings, including weapons. You could be sentenced as an accomplice for taking part in or provoking a gathering.  Local authorities may also restrict Internet access.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse-snatching, occurs in markets and commercial areas.

Violent crime, such as armed robbery, banditry, burglary and carjacking occur. These crimes occur across the country, including in N'Djamena.

* Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Avoid showing signs of affluence or wearing expensive jewellery
* Avoid carrying large sums of cash or unnecessary valuables
* Be aware of your surroundings and vigilant at all times
* Avoid walking alone, especially after dark
* If confronted by an armed individual, don’t resist

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism. Attacks could occur at any time. Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places. Be particularly vigilant during:

* sporting events
* religious holidays
* public celebrations
* major political events, such as demonstrations and elections

Terrorists may use such occasions to mount attacks.

### Kidnappings

Kidnappings have occurred in the following regions:

* Lake Chad Basin
* Tandjilé
* border areas with the following countries:

+ Cameroon
+ Sudan
+ Central African Republic

Kidnappers have targeted foreigners.

If you plan to travel to Chad despite the risks:

* be vigilant at all times
* use varied and unpredictable routes and itineraries
* travel only in a convoy of at least two vehicles for long trips
* if you’re threatened, don’t resist

### Celebratory gunfire

While illegal, firing weapons to celebrate is common in Chad. It sometimes coincides with fireworks displays and may take place:

* at weddings
* following elections
* at some political events

Injuries and deaths due to stray bullets have occurred, including at great distances from the shooting locations.

During celebratory gunfire:

* avoid areas where they are taking place
* stay inside buildings
* stay away from windows

### Telecommunications

Telecommunication systems are very unreliable outside N’Djamena. If you have a Thuraya satellite phones, you must register it with Chadian authorities.

### Road safety

Road conditions are dangerous. Roads are poorly maintained and mostly unpaved, even in N’Djamena. Streets are poorly lit and road signs are often missing. Excessive speeds, erratic driving habits, lack of vehicle maintenance, roaming wildlife and livestock, cyclists and pedestrians pose risks. You are advised not to travel between cities at night due to poor road infrastructure.

Fuel is not always available in major cities and is very scarce in rural areas.

It is preferable to hire a local driver to avoid being the victim of mob justice in response to a road accident.

* Keep windows closed and doors locked at all times
* Stop and cooperate at all police or military roadblocks
* Have proper identification readily available

You should travel in a convoy outside N’Djamena, travel during daylight hours only and carry additional fuel, a spare tire and provisions.

### Public transportation

There is no operational train or bus network in Chad. Trucks and minibuses are not properly maintained and are often dangerous; they are not recommended for any intercity travel.

### Air travel

We don't make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.
