## Natural disasters and climate

### Climate change

Climate change is affecting Japan. Extreme and unusual weather events are becoming more frequent and may affect your travel plans. Monitor local news to stay informed on the current situation.

### Seasonal risks

Snowstorms occur in western Honshu and Hokkaido from December to March.

Avalanches can occur in mountainous areas, including at ski resorts. These can cause power disruptions, make roads impassable and limit the ability of responders to reach these areas in case of emergency.

### Typhoons

Typhoons usually occur between June and October. During this period, even small storms can quickly develop into major typhoons. Southern areas, including Okinawa and surrounding islands, are more vulnerable.

These severe storms can put you at risk and hamper the provision of essential services.

If you decide to travel to Japan during the typhoon season:

* know that you expose yourself to serious safety risks
* be prepared to change your travel plans on short notice, including cutting short or cancelling your trip
* stay informed of the latest regional weather forecasts
* carry emergency contact information for your airline or tour operator
* follow the advice and instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders

### Seismic activity

Japan is located in an active seismic zone and is prone to a multitude of natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding, volcanic eruptions. Strong earthquakes occur, as well as tsunamis.

#### Earthquakes

Each year, Japan experiences thousands of earthquakes of varying magnitudes, some triggering tsunamis. Deaths, injuries and significant damage may occur.

#### Tsunamis

Japan is prone to tsunamis. A tsunami can occur within minutes of a nearby earthquake. However, the risk of tsunami can remain for several hours following the first tremor. If you're staying on the coast, familiarize yourself with the region's evacuation plans in the event of a tsunami warning.

#### Volcanoes

There are a number of active volcanoes. The Japan Meteorological Agency lists active volcanoes and associated warnings.

If you are travelling near a volcano, check for the latest activity and warnings. Always follow the advice and instructions of local authorities.
