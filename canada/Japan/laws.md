## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

In many cases, arrested or detained suspects are denied oral or written communication with anyone other than their lawyer or a Canadian consular representative for an extended period.

If you are detained, even for a minor offence, you may be held without charge for up to 23 days. Police officers may begin their initial questioning before you see a lawyer. You could also be in detention for weeks or months during the investigation and legal proceedings.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect jail sentences and heavy fines. Japan has a zero-tolerance policy with respect to drugs, including recreational drugs and cannabis. Severe penalties are imposed for the possession of even a small quantity.

### Medications

Certain medications are banned in Japan, including:

* adderall
* amphetamines
* codeine
* methamphetamines
* pseudoephedrine

You may bring a one-month supply of prescription medication or a two-month supply of non-prescription medication into Japan, as long as the medication does not contain narcotics (including codeine). You cannot bring banned substances with you, even with a prescription.

You must have a doctor's note that states your full name, address, the reason for use, and dosage, along with your prescribed medication. Local authorities may also request a detailed listing of the contents of the medication.

If you wish to bring in larger supplies of medication or bring in prescription medication that contains narcotics, you must apply in advance for import certification. You should do so several months prior to arrival.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Japanese law doesn't prohibit sexual acts between individuals of the same sex. However, homosexuality is not widely socially accepted.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Japan.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of Japan, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

If you acquire 2 or more citizenships at birth, you can keep them all, including Japanese citizenship, until the age of 18. At 18, you must choose between your Japanese citizenship or other citizenships within a 2-year period.

### Family Law

Japanese family law is different from Canadian family law.

In Japan, joint custody of a child after separation is not a legal option if one of the parents is a Japanese national. As a result, access rights for a non-custodial parent can be limited, if granted.

If you are involved in a custody or other family law dispute in Japan, consult a Japanese family lawyer.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Japan.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Japan, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Japanese court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Japan to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Identification

You must carry your passport or residence card at all times.

A photocopy will not satisfy authorities. Police officers in Japan may ask for your identification documents at any time.

If you fail to do so, you could face arrest or detention.

### Working in Japan

Working without an appropriate visa is illegal. Offenders may be subject to imprisonment, a fine and deportation.

If you are considering employment offers in Japan, contact the Japanese embassy or consulate nearest you before coming to Japan.

#### Teaching English

You should carefully review a contract to teach English before you sign. There have been incidents of employers not adhering to their contractual obligations.

Ensure that all terms and conditions of employment are clearly stated in the contract and that you meet all requirements before accepting an offer.

### Tattoos

You may be denied entry to public establishments such as swimming pools, hot springs, beaches and some gyms if you have a tattoo.

Some establishments may ask that you cover your tattoo.

### Driving

Traffic drives on the left.

You must carry an international driving permit along with your Canadian licence, or a Japanese driver's licence.

#### Insurance

You must also obtain Japanese insurance. There are two types of driving insurance available:

* compulsory insurance, which is basic government-mandated insurance covering your legal liability
* voluntary insurance, obtained on your own from a private company and designed for your needs

Should you have an accident, compulsory insurance may not be sufficient.

#### Drinking and driving

Penalties for drinking and driving are severe.

Under Japanese law, it's forbidden to:

* drive if you have been drinking
* lend a car to someone who has been drinking
* serve alcohol to someone who has to drive

If you are a passenger in a car whose driver is under the influence of alcohol, you both are subject to prosecution.

### Money

The currency of Japan is the yen (JPY).

Credit cards are accepted in most major hotels and restaurants, but Japan is a predominantly cash-based society.

ATMs are widely available, but many don't accept foreign debit cards.
