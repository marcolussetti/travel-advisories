## Safety and security

### Fukushima nuclear power plant and surrounding area

Following the 2011 incident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, Japanese authorities have placed restrictions, including travel and overnight stay bans, on the plant's surrounding area due to the risk of exposure to radiation. Restricted areas are clearly identified.

Follow the instructions of local authorities.

### Tensions on Korean Peninsula

The regional security situation on the neighbouring Korean Peninsula could deteriorate suddenly. Tensions may increase before, during and after North Korean nuclear and missile tests. Military exercises and activities may also escalate tension.

* Remain vigilant
* Monitor developments to stay informed on the current situation
* Follow the instructions of local authorities, including the Cabinet Secretariat's guidance on civil protection

### Bears

There is an increased presence of bears in northern Japan, including in Akita, Niigata, Hokkaido prefectures.

Bears have been sighted in urban areas, including resorts and hiking trails. Some encounters have resulted in casualties.

If you plan on visiting northern Japan:

* always be aware of your surroundings and stay vigilant
* avoid walking alone in areas where bears have been sighted
* follow the warnings or alerts issued by local authorities

### Crime

Crimes against foreigners are low but increasing. Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs from time to time. Be cautious in entertainment and nightlife districts throughout Japan, especially in these areas in Tokyo:

* Kabukicho
* Roppongi
* Shibuya
* Ikebukuro
* Shinjuku
* Golden-gai

If you are the victim of a crime, file a police report at the closest station of the incident. Occasionally, local police may be hesitant to prepare a report for foreigners. If this happens, you can request additional assistance from the Japanese tourist hotline or contact the closest Canadian embassy or consulate for a list of local lawyers.

### Drug trafficking

An increasing number of travellers report having been used as unwitting drug couriers.

Penalties for drug-related criminal activities are severe. Even unsuspecting individuals transporting packages containing narcotics can be criminally charged and face long jail sentences.

Be wary of individuals, even those you know, who ask you to carry a package to Japan on their behalf.

### Spiked food and drinks

Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

There are reports of incidents where staff, or other customers at bars and nightclubs, have mixed drugs and copious amounts of alcohol into drinks of unsuspecting clients. These incidents are particularly frequent in the following districts of Toyko:

* Kabukicho
* Roppongi
* Shinjuku
* Golden-gai

The intent is to defraud, overcharge services, rob or assault the person.

### Fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud occurs. There have been incidents of overcharging at bars and clubs. Disputes over overcharging have led to violence.

Be cautious when using debit or credit cards:

* pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others
* use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements and contact your financial institution as soon as possible if irregularities

There are reports of foreigners being drugged in entertainment districts and taken to ATMs to withdraw funds while under the influence, sometimes with little to no recollection of events.

Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse. Inappropriate physical contact may occur on busy subways and trains. There are women-only train cars during rush hour on some subway and train lines.

### Public transportation

#### Taxis

Taxis are generally safe.

* Use only officially marked taxis
* Negotiate fares in advance, or insist that the driver use the meter, as you may be overcharged
* Have your destination written in Japanese as drivers may not understand English

Travel by subway and train is quick and convenient. Signs are usually in Japanese but signage in English is becoming more common, especially in larger cities and at tourist destinations.
