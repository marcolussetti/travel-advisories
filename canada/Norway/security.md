# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching occurs, particularly during the tourism season, from May to September.

Thieves work alone or in groups and may use various techniques to distract you and steal your belongings.

They are especially active in crowded areas, such as:

* airports, train stations and public transportation facilities, including Oslo’s Central (railway) Station
* hotel lobbies
* restaurants, patios and outdoor cafés
* tourist attractions

Ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times.

#### Violent crime

Violent crime is uncommon, but gang-related violence may occur in certain areas.

While tourists are not specifically targeted, you could find yourself in the wrong place at the wrong time.

Always be vigilant and aware of your surroundings, particularly after dark.

### Fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud occurs. When using debit or credit cards:

* pay careful attention if other people are handling your cards
* use ATMs located in public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements
* never save your debit or credit card’s details in unknown laptops or electronic devices

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in Europe. Terrorists have carried out attacks in several European cities. Terrorist attacks could occur at any time.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places. Be particularly vigilant during:

* religious holidays
* public celebrations
* major political events, such as elections

Terrorists may use such occasions to mount attacks.

The Government of Norway maintains a public alert system on terrorism. Norway’s current threat level is 3, “moderate”, on a 5-step scale. Local authorities publish threat level changes online and through local media.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations occur from time to time. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Adventure and Arctic tourism

Adventure tourism may lead to serious safety concerns if not well-organized. Weather conditions can change rapidly, even in summer.

In winter, heavy snowfall can make it difficult to reach certain areas. Roads may become impassable. There is also a risk of avalanches, some of which can be fatal.

If you undertake adventure tourism, such as trekking, glacier climbing or skiing, especially in the Arctic regions and remote areas of Norway:

* never do so alone
* obtain detailed information on each activity before setting out
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* don’t venture off marked trails
* ensure that you’re properly equipped
* carry a cellphone or a GPS that can generate your position in case of emergency
* ensure that you’re well informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary

#### Svalbard archipelago

The presence of polar bears in the Svalbard archipelago may put your safety at high risk.

Do not venture outside of the settlements without a guide and proper equipment.

### Cruise ship travel

Unpredictable weather in Norway may disrupt cruise ship travel and lead to rough seas, cancellation, delays and itinerary changes without notice. Rescue operations may also be very limited in remote areas, particularly in Nordic regions and Svalbard.

If you decide to take a cruise in Norway:

* choose a well-established and reputable cruise company
* ensure that your travel insurance covers cruise ship travel and includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety are good.

Some roads may be narrow, hazardous and impassable in winter, particularly in northern areas.

Road accidents involving wildlife are common.

Be particularly vigilant if driving at night.

### Public transportation

Public transportation services are efficient and reliable.

#### Trains and buses

Norway has an extensive railway network that connects main cities. Oslo also has a metro.

Most cities have good public bus systems. Long-distance bus lines are also available.

#### Taxis

Taxis are widely available but may be expensive.

Use only officially marked taxis, particularly in Oslo.

#### Ferry

There are daily ferry connections with Denmark, Sweden and Germany.
