## Natural disasters and climate

### Storms Leonardo and Marta

Heavy rains, flash floods, snow, strong winds and dangerous coastal waves caused by storm Leonardo have affected much of continental Portugal since February 2, 2026. Further severe weather from storm Marta is forecast to continue until at least February 9. A state of emergency is in effect until February 15.

The storm has caused significant flooding, casualties, and damage to buildings and infrastructure. Many of the affected areas are still recovering from damages due to the recent impact of storm Kristin. Storm Marta could bring further damage to infrastructure and cause severe disruptions to travel and transportation across the country.

If you are in an affected area:

* monitor local news and weather reports
* confirm your flight status before going to the airport
* follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders

### Climate change

Climate change is affecting Portugal. Extreme and unusual weather events are becoming more frequent and may affect your travel plans. Monitor local media for the latest information.

### Wildfires

High temperatures create dry conditions, which can lead to large fires throughout Portugal, particularly during the summer. Fires can cause disruptions to communications and transportation networks.

Heavy smoke may deteriorate the air quality in areas near active fires.

Causing a forest fire is treated as a criminal offence, even if unintentional, and is punishable by heavy fines or imprisonment.

In case of a major fire:

* stay away from the affected areas, particularly if you suffer from respiratory ailments
* monitor local media for the latest information
* follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders
