## Natural disasters and climate

### Severe storms

Heavy rains, flash floods, cold temperatures, strong winds and dangerous coastal waves caused by a cluster of severe winter storms have affected much of continental Portugal since February 2, 2026. Further severe weather is forecast to continue. A state of emergency is in effect until February 15.

The storms have caused significant flooding, casualties, and damage to buildings and infrastructure. Further storms could cause additional damage to infrastructure, including roads, and disruptions to travel and transportation across the country.

If you are in an affected area:

* monitor local news and weather reports
* confirm your flight status before going to the airport
* follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders

### Climate change

Climate change is affecting Portugal. Extreme and unusual weather events are becoming more frequent and may affect your travel plans. Monitor local media for the latest information.

### Wildfires

High temperatures create dry conditions, which can lead to large fires throughout Portugal, particularly during the summer. Fires can cause disruptions to communications and transportation networks.

Heavy smoke may deteriorate the air quality in areas near active fires.

Causing a forest fire is treated as a criminal offence, even if unintentional, and is punishable by heavy fines or imprisonment.

In case of a major fire:

* stay away from the affected areas, particularly if you suffer from respiratory ailments
* monitor local media for the latest information
* follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders
