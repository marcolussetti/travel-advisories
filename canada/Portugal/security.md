## Safety and security

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and bag snatching, is common, especially in major cities like Lisbon and Porto. Thieves often target tourists.

Be particularly vigilant in crowded public areas such as:

* popular tourist areas, including lookouts
* trams, buses, trains, bus and train stations, and airports
* hotel lobbies
* restaurants, including outdoor seating areas
* beaches

In Lisbon, be extra cautious on trams 15, 25 and 28.

Thieves can strike anywhere, including in small, popular tourist towns and destinations on the coast.

During your trip:

* keep your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, in a secure place
* do not show signs of affluence or wear expensive jewellery
* do not carry large sums of cash or valuables unnecessarily
* avoid walking alone after dark
* be aware of your surroundings, especially in busy tourist areas
* avoid using ATMs in isolated or poorly lit areas
* never leave personal belongings unattended in a vehicle, even in the trunk

#### Violent crime

Violent crime is rare but occurs.

Home burglaries happen in larger cities and coastal areas and sometimes affect homes or vacation rental apartments offered through online accommodation applications.

* Stay in accommodations with adequate security measures
* Keep doors and windows locked at night and when you are away

Vehicle break-ins are frequent. Thieves target vehicles with rental car stickers and foreign license plates.

If you choose to drive in Portugal:

* always keep doors and windows closed and locked
* do not leave valuables within reach or in plain sight
* never leave personal belongings unattended in a vehicle, even in the trunk
* park your vehicle in a secure area, especially at night
* if possible, avoid renting vehicles with identifiable rental car company stickers

Physical and sexual assaults occur, particularly in popular tourist areas and in bars and nightclubs in Lisbon, Porto and the Algarve.

* Always be aware of your surroundings
* Travel in groups
* Pay attention to people walking behind you

To report a crime and obtain a police report, go to a police station. There are tourist police stations in Lisbon, Porto, Cascais, and Praia da Rocha in Portimão. Local establishments, such as hotels, will be able to direct you to the nearest police station.

### Terrorism

While there have been no recent terrorist attacks in Portugal, they can still happen. There is a threat of terrorism in Europe. Terrorists have carried out attacks in several European cities and further attacks are likely.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including police stations
* schools, including universities
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners
* cultural venues

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

Be particularly vigilant during sporting events, religious holidays, public celebrations and major political events, such as elections, as terrorists have used such occasions to mount attacks.

The Portuguese government maintains a public alert system on terrorism and communicates threat-level changes online and through social media. Portugal's current threat level is 3, “significant,” on a scale of 5.

### Spiked food, drinks and other items

Criminals sometimes add drugs to items that could put you at risk of sexual assault or robbery.

Items may include:

* food and drinks
* gum
* cigarettes

Incidents are most likely to occur in nightclubs, bars and restaurants.

While you’re in Portugal:

* be wary of accepting these items from new acquaintances
* never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers
* order drinks in sealed bottles or cans instead of in plastic cups

### Demonstrations and strikes

Demonstrations and strikes occur frequently. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Water activities

Coastal waters can be dangerous, even for excellent swimmers. Coastal ocean currents are powerful and rip currents are common. Drownings occur every year.

Always obey warning flags at beaches, lakes and rivers.

The flags are there for your own safety. The Portuguese Maritime Police could fine you for disobeying a warning flag.

In marine areas, coral, jellyfish, stingrays and other marine life found along reefs can poison, sting or cause infection if touched or stepped on.

Ask local authorities about the presence of such species and whether they are dangerous.

* Do not visit beaches or coastal areas during periods of severe weather warnings
* Look out for signs of cliff erosion and falling rocks
* Do not dive into unknown waters, as hidden rocks or shallow depths can cause serious injury or death
* Exercise caution and follow the advice of the local authorities

### Adventure tourism

Outdoor activities such as hiking and mountain biking can be dangerous, especially in Madeira.

If you intend to participate in adventure tourism activities:

* share your itinerary with a friend or family member if you’re alone
* stay on marked trails and consider hiring an experienced guide from a reputable company
* obtain detailed information on your activity and the environment in which you will be setting out
* buy travel insurance that covers incidents related to these types of recreational activities
* ensure that you have proper equipment and bring sufficient water
* monitor weather conditions and other possible hazards

### Roads

Fatal accidents are frequent.

Drivers don’t always respect traffic laws. Motorcyclists tend to be reckless and drive at excessive speeds and tailgate.

Always drive defensively.

Most highways in Portugal require toll payments. You may need to pay via an electronic payment method. International credit or debit cards are not always accepted.

### Public transportation

#### Taxis

Baggage fees and toll charges are sometimes added to the final bill if starting your trip at the airport. There could be discrepancies between the amount the driver is charging you and the meter fare.

* Only use officially marked taxis
* Confirm the driver's identity and license plate before getting into the car
* Never share a taxi with strangers
