# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

The authorities of a country or territory decide who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Serbian authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for the expected duration of your stay in Serbia.

Ensure to have your passport stamped when you enter and leave Serbia to avoid issues exiting and re-entering the country.

#### Passport for official travel

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Registration

You must register with the local police within 24 hours of arrival in Serbia. Registration will normally be arranged by your hotel or your host. Failure to register can result in fines and difficulties when departing.

### Kosovo

Serbia does not recognize any border crossing points from Kosovo as official international entry points. Don’t attempt to enter Serbia directly from Kosovo unless you initially travelled into Kosovo from Serbia and obtained a valid entry stamp from the Serbian immigration authorities. Otherwise, you should transit via a third country such as Albania, North Macedonia or Montenegro.

Entry to Kosovo from Serbia is subject to delays or may be prohibited entirely. Some border posts have been closed for short periods. Verify the border situation before you undertake travel. If travelling by road, you may have to provide proof of the purpose of your visit to Kosovo at the checkpoint between Serbia and Kosovo. Some travellers may be exempted, such as holders of a Serbian identity card.
