### Areas bordering Kosovo

Exercise a high degree of caution within 10km of the border with Kosovo due to the potential for political tensions, possible civil unrest and the presence of  landmines.

Stay on the main roads. Unexploded landmines and other unexploded ordnance remain in Serbia, particularly in the southern Serbian district of Pčinja, including the municipalities of Bujanovac and Preševo.

Disputes between ethnic Serb communities and local authorities in Northern Kosovo could lead to tensions and security incidents near the border.

If you are near the border with Kosovo:

* expect an increased presence of military and security forces
* follow the instructions of local authorities
* don’t attempt to enter Kosovo directly from Serbia

### Areas bordering North Macedonia

Expect possible delays at the border with North Macedonia due to the migrant situation.

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing, occurs. Thieves target tourists, particularly in crowded public areas such as:

* buses, trains, bus and train stations and airports
* large crowds or public markets

During your trip:

* keep your personal belongings, including passports and other travel documents, in a secure place
* don't show signs of affluence or wear expensive jewellery
* don't carry large sums of cash or valuables unnecessarily

Car thieves target luxury vehicles and four-wheel-drive models. Avoid leaving any luggage or valuables in the vehicle and use secure parking facilities.

### Fraud

Credit card fraud is common. When using credit cards:

* pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others
* use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

* Use secure public Wi-Fi networks
* Avoid making purchases on unencrypted websites
* Be cautious when posting information on social media
* Be particularly vigilant when contacting or meeting individuals known over the internet
* Never click a suspicious link in an email or text message asking for your credit card details

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in Europe. Terrorist attacks have occurred in a number of European cities. There is a potential for other violent incidents.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Serbian law does not prohibit sexual acts between individuals of the same sex. However, homosexuality is not widely socially accepted.

2SLGBTQI+ persons have been targets of harassment and violence. Some Pride events have met organized counter-protests, which may create an intimidating or threatening environment.

### Soccer matches

Confrontations, which at times become violent, may occur between opposing fans at soccer matches. This is especially true for matches between Belgrade clubs Partizan and Red Star. Traffic and public transportation may also be affected.

* Exercise caution if you attend a soccer match or if you stay near sporting venues
* Be aware of large groups of supporters during a soccer match

### Road safety

#### Road conditions

Road conditions and road safety can vary greatly throughout the country.

Secondary roads are often narrow and poorly maintained. State Road 22 connecting Belgrade to the border with Montenegro, commonly known as “Ibarska Magistrala,” is dangerous due to poor road conditions.

#### Serbian licence plates

Travellers driving to neighbouring countries with Serbian plates could face tensions, especially when driving on the roads and at border crossings in:

* Kosovo
* Bosnia and Herzegovina
* Croatia
* Albania.

If you plan on travelling in the region with a car registered in Serbia, be aware of your surroundings.

Dial 987 for roadside assistance.

### Public transportation

Safety standards vary on public transportation. Buses and trams are often in poor condition and are frequently out of order or forced to stop mid-route for repairs.

#### Taxis

Use only officially marked taxis and pre-negotiate fares where a meter is not in use. At Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport, use the taxi reservation service in the baggage claim area to avoid being charged exorbitant rates for transportation to the city centre.

If departing from a hotel or restaurant, consider calling for a radio taxi. Operators usually speak English and will guarantee an official taxi.

#### Trains

Rail service is slow and often subject to delays due to extensive repairs on outdated railway tracks. Railway equipment is old and poorly maintained. Rail service is not an efficient means of domestic or regional travel.

#### International bus

Several companies offer domestic and international bus services. The larger companies have modern, well-maintained fleets.

### Air travel

We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.
