## Safety and security

### Crime

The crime rate is very low. Petty crime occurs.

Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times.

### Water activities

The outer coasts of Tuvalu’s atolls can be dangerous due to very strong current. The Funafuti lagoon is highly polluted.

* Follow the instructions and warnings of local authorities
* Ensure that you’re properly equipped
* Ensure that you’re well informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
