# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### State of emergency

A state of emergency is in effect in the provinces of Lima and Callao to curb a rise in violent crime.

The Peruvian government frequently declares regional states of emergency and publishes the information in *El Peruano*. A state of emergency allows the military to assist police forces to respond to security incidents and natural disasters. When a state of emergency is in effect, security forces have increased rights to:

* restrict freedom of movement
* monitor correspondence
* conduct search and seizures
* detain persons of interest

If you are in Peru during a state of emergency:

* monitor local media for the latest information
* follow the instructions of local authorities
* avoid crowds

### Valley of the Apurímac, Ene and Mantaro rivers (VRAEM)

#### Drug trafficking

Cocaine production and trafficking occurs in VRAEM. Travel is particularly dangerous in areas where there is coca cultivation and processing.

#### Domestic terrorism

Incidents of domestic terrorism have occurred in VRAEM, particularly the region where the Apurímac, Ayacucho, Cuzco and Junín departments meet. Although tourists are rarely involved, you could be in the wrong place at the wrong time.

### Border area with Colombia

Criminal activity related to drug production and trafficking, illegal mining and the presence of armed groups near the border, particularly along the Putumayo River, pose a threat to personal security.

### Border area with Ecuador

Expect an increased security presence in the border area due to crime, particularly theft and extortion. Landmines and unmarked minefields are also present along the border.

Only cross the Peru–Ecuador border at the official crossing point near Tumbes, the Centro Binacional de Atención Fronteriza (Binational Border Centre). Access this border crossing via the Pan-American Highway. This is the only land border crossing with Ecuador that is currently open.

Be aware that basic services in the Tumbes district have become increasingly difficult to access due to an increased number of migrants entering Peru from Ecuador.

### Province of Lima

There has recently been a marked increase in violent crime in the Province of Lima, including in the city of Lima. Theft is very common, and thieves may be armed with guns.

### Crime

Crime rates are high throughout the country.

* Always be aware of your surroundings, especially at night
* Avoid walking in deserted or under-populated areas
* Travel in groups whenever possible

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and bag snatching, occurs frequently, particularly in:

* Arequipa
* Cusco
* Lima
* Puno

Theft occurs frequently, particularly in crowded public areas such as:

* buses, trains, bus and train stations, and airports
* hotel lobbies
* restaurants

During your trip:

* keep your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, in a secure place
* don’t show signs of affluence or wear expensive jewellery
* avoid using your phone at the roadside or in a vehicle with the windows open, as motorists may snatch it
* never leave bags unattended

Pickpockets and bag snatchers may work in pairs or groups and employ a variety of ruses to divert their victim’s attention. A common scam involves spraying a substance on victims and then robbing them while pretending to help clean the stain, or distracting the victim by asking questions while another person perpetrates the theft. In some cases, thieves on motorcycles will snatch purses, backpacks or cellular phones.

#### Violent crime

Violent crime occurs. Incidents have included:

* armed robberies
* assaults, including sexual assaults
* carjackings
* kidnappings
* extortion

#### Armed robbery

Armed robberies are on the rise. While most victims are not physically injured, criminals will not hesitate to use force when opposed.

Armed robberies occur, including in tourist areas, particularly when travellers walk alone.

* Don’t show signs of affluence or wear expensive jewellery
* If you are robbed, hand over your cash, electronic devices and valuables without resistance
* Be extra cautious when withdrawing cash from ATMs and use ATMs inside banks and during regular service hours
* Don’t resist an attack

#### Sexual assault

Incidents of sexual assault, including rape, occur throughout the country. In some cases, tour guides have been implicated.

* Do not travel alone, especially after dark
* Remain particularly vigilant at bus terminals and in taxis
* Be careful when dealing with strangers or recent acquaintances, especially regarding the acceptance of rides or other invitations

If you are a victim of sexual assault, you should be report it to the police immediately. Medical examinations at identified clinics are part of the investigation process. Those who delay reporting may experience more scrutiny by local authorities.

#### Assault

Assaults have occurred along the Inca Trail and in the Huaraz region of the Cordillera Blanca mountains. Hiking in these regions should be done in groups.

#### Kidnapping

Express kidnappings involving tourists have occurred. Victims are usually abducted for a few hours and forced to withdraw money from ATMs for their release. Most express kidnappings take place at night, but incidents also occur during daylight hours. Incidents often involve criminals posing as taxi drivers, or taxi drivers working for organized gangs.

 Virtual kidnappings occur throughout the country. Criminals use stolen cellphones to contact family members claiming to have kidnapped the owner of the phone and then ask for ransom money.

* Be suspicious of strangers approaching you on the street
* Never leave your cellphone unattended
* Be cautious when using cellphones and smart devices in public as they are often targeted by thieves, especially while people are using them
* Ensure your phone is password protected

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations occur frequently, often with little to no notice. Roadblocks are frequently erected during demonstrations, which can complicate travel plans. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. Police have used tear gas and other methods to disperse crowds. Authorities often declare a state of emergency in response to demonstrations. Protestors may also block rivers essential for transportation in some remote regions, including the Manu River area of Madre de Dios Department and Iquitos region. This may result in tourists being temporarily stranded.

Peruvian law prohibits political activities by foreigners. You may face detention or deportation if you take part in a demonstration.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

[Mass gatherings (large-scale events)](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/mass-gatherings)

### Strikes

Strikes occur frequently, often with little or no notice, and expand quickly from one region to another. Strikes can complicate travel and disrupt public transport and services, including your ability to travel to or leave isolated tourist destinations such as Machu Picchu. They could also lead to border closures, including with Bolivia.

### Organized crime

Organized crime and violence associated with it has increased throughout the country. In some parts of the country, military and security forces are deployed to assist police in combatting organized crime.

### Domestic terrorism

Incidents of domestic terrorism occur, particularly in remote jungle areas, such as:

* parts of the Huancavelica and Ucayali departments
* the Upper Huallaga River Valley in the Huánuco and San Martín departments

Incidents have included:

* raids
* temporary ambushes of small villages
* bombings or threats of violence against local security forces or community figures

Overland travel in these regions is unsafe.

### Fraud

#### Counterfeit currency

Counterfeit currency in both sol and U.S. dollars is a growing and serious problem. Counterfeit bills are widely distributed, including by banks, casinos and local stores.

Avoid moneychangers on the street, as they may carry counterfeit currency or work with pickpockets.

#### Credit card fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud occurs. Be cautious when using debit or credit cards:

* pay careful attention when others are handling your cards
* use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

#### Scams

Criminals posing as taxi drivers often rob tourists along the route to and from Peru’s main airports, including Lima’s Jorge Chávez International Airport, and at bus terminals.

* Only use authorized cabs located inside airport terminals and bus stations
* Only use reputable cab companies or ride-sharing apps
* Avoid hailing taxis on the street

Thieves also pose as police officers to gain the confidence and cooperation of their potential victims.

* If you are stopped by local authorities, ask to see official identification and record the officer’s name, badge number and district
* For traffic violations, request that the officer issue you a fine in writing, which is payable at a later date
* You should also note the location of the arrest

Legitimate police officers have also extorted money in exchange for dismissing minor offences or traffic violations. They have also stolen money and valuables during searches. If you are searched, even at the airport, ensure you have all your belongings before leaving.

Scammers may pose as volunteer organizations or owners of rental properties.

* If you are planning to participate in volunteer activities in Peru, ensure that the company organizing your trip is legitimate
  + When booking accommodations, use reputable platforms and companies

### Spiked food and drinks

Snacks, beverages, gum and cigarettes may contain drugs, including incapacitating drugs such as Rohypnol and Scopolamine, that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

* Be wary of accepting these items from new acquaintances
* Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers

### Harassment

Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment or verbal abuse.

Homosexuality is not widely accepted in Peruvian society. 2SLGBTQI+ travellers could be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression or sex characteristics. Avoid public displays of affection.

### Telecommunications

In remote areas, the telecommunications network is not always reliable and Internet access may be limited.

### Adventure travel

Outdoor activities can be dangerous if unprepared. Each year, hikers and climbers are victims of serious, sometimes fatal, accidents in the Andes. Trails may be steep, slippery, poorly marked and maintained. Some hikers have become lost on trails around Machu Picchu in the Cusco Region and Huaraz in the Ancash region.  Tour operators may not meet Canadian safety standards.

Access to Vinicunca, the “Rainbow Mountain”, is regularly disrupted by violent disputes between communities located around routes in the Cusipata and Pitumarca districts. If you plan to visit Vinicunca, consult your tour operator to confirm that the area is secure and that access is open.

* Stay on marked trails and consider hiring a registered guide from a reputable company
* Know the symptoms of high-altitude illnesses, dehydration and heatstroke, which can be fatal
* Share your itinerary with a friend or family member if hiking alone
* Obtain detailed information on your activity and on the environment in which you will be setting out
* Buy travel insurance that covers incidents related to this type of recreational activity
* Monitor weather conditions and other possible hazards
* Ensure that you have proper equipment and bring sufficient water

### Sand buggies

There are reports of accidents, severe injuries and deaths involving recreational sand buggies, particularly in the sand dunes around Ica and Lake Huacachina. These vehicles are not regulated, often poorly maintained, and safety equipment is not always available.

### Water activities

There have been several recent white-water rafting accidents and drownings involving tourists, particularly on the Urubamba River near Cusco. Companies offering white-water rafting, their guides and their equipment may not be held to the same standards as similar companies in Canada. Rescue services may not be consistent with international standards.

Coastal waters can be dangerous. Strong currents exist in the Pacific Ocean and in rivers. Lifeguards are not always present or properly trained at beaches.

Swimming in jungle lakes and rivers can be dangerous due to the presence of parasites and wildlife.

Seek advice and consult residents and local authorities about conditions before swimming, surfing or participating in other aquatic activities.

### Ayahuasca ceremonies

Spiritual cleansing and ayahuasca ceremonies, offered by shamans and other individuals, involve consuming substances that can cause medical complications and severely impair cognitive and physical abilities. Exposure to these substances has led to serious illness, injury, assault and even the death of several tourists.

Ceremonies often take place in remote areas with no access to medical or mental health facilities or resources and limited communication with local authorities. Most of the time, the facilities lack basic first aid or emergency plans for those suffering from physical or psychological illness from these ceremonies. Ayahuasca ceremonies are not regulated and there is no way to assess the safety of any of the services, operators or shamans.

Avoid participating in spiritual cleansing or ayahuasca ceremonies.

### Roads

Mountainous roads can be dangerous, especially at night.  Accidents causing fatalities are common.

Police checks can cause traffic delays.

When renting a vehicle, always purchase insurance. Most drivers in Peru have only the minimum required car insurance, which may not adequately cover accidents.

Vehicles are a target for robbery. Criminals have different tactics, including throwing objects in front of oncoming traffic in the hope that cars will stop or dispersing nails on the road to puncture tires and force people to stop. If this occurs and you need to stop, do so only in a safe location, such as a gas station.

* While travelling by car, keep your doors locked and windows shut at all times
* Keep your personal belongings in the trunk of the vehicle, as criminals have been known to shatter windows to “smash and grab” and to attempt entry when they see travel bags or merchandise
* Follow the main roads used by bus tour companies
* Avoid travelling by road outside of major cities after dark, when there is a higher risk of robbery

#### Road conditions

Road conditions vary throughout the country.

Driving can also be dangerous due to:

* bad road markings and signage
* lack of guardrails
* narrow, winding and mountainous roads

#### Driving habits

Some drivers and motorcyclists can be aggressive and reckless and do not always respect traffic laws.

### Amazon River

Thieves, often armed, have targeted tourists travelling by boat along the Amazon River. If you are visiting the Amazon River, only use a reputable tour operator.

### Public transportation

Buses and minibuses operate between most major cities. Demonstrations and strikes can lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

#### Buses and coaches

Many local buses in Lima are old, poorly maintained and overcrowded. Drivers of these vehicles tend to dominate the roads and disregard other drivers or pedestrians.

Intercity bus travel can be dangerous due to the risk of bus accidents, which are usually caused by excessive speed, poor vehicle maintenance and driver fatigue. Armed gangs have been known to stop buses to rob travellers, especially at night. Incidents of assaults on buses have also been reported.

The Government of Peru publishes a list of the bus companies with the highest rates of involvement in fatal or serious injury traffic accidents.

* Only use reputable transportation companies
* Avoid taking buses and coaches at night
* Always keep your personal belongings and identification on you for long-distance travel
* Avoid storing bags under or above your seat and on empty seats

### Trains

Trains operate between Arequipa-Cusco-Puno and between Cusco-Ollantaytambo-Machu Picchu**.**Demonstrations, strikes and derailments can disrupt travel by train, including trains to or from Machu Picchu.

### Taxis

Licensed taxis are not metered. Taxi drivers sometimes do not provide change or will continue to drive until they can obtain change.

* Avoid hailing taxis on the street
* Use official taxi compagnies located inside airports’ terminals or bus stations
* Only use reputable taxi companies through establishments such as hotels or ride-sharing apps
* Confirm the fare in advance
* Don’t pay until you have reached your destination
