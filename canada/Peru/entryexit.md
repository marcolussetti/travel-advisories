# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

The authorities of a country or territory decide who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Peruvian authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country's entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months after the date of your arrival in Peru.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

You should also be aware that current systems used by some countries and travel companies may not recognize the “X” gender identifier. You may still be asked to provide your sex/gender information as either male or female when travelling.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Entering by land

If you enter Peru by land, you must obtain an entry stamp in your passport.

### Ecuador entry restrictions

If you enter Ecuador from Peru through land or river borders, you must present a criminal record check from your country of origin or residence. The original criminal record check and the Spanish translation must be apostilled and cover the past five years. Minors travelling with their family members are generally exempt.

If you cannot provide a criminal record check, the Ecuadorian Migration System will check to verify that you don’t have previous convictions.

### Overstays

Overstaying is a criminal offence. There is a fine for each day of overstay. This fee must be paid upon exiting the country.

### Domestic flights

Rules for international flights also apply to domestic flights within Peru, including touristic flights over the Nazca lines archaeological site. Pisco International Airport is the closest and safest airport from Lima that offers this type of flight.

Carry your passport with you and be prepared to show it to officials

### Dual citizenship

Peruvian Canadians entering Peru using their Canadian passport are subject to visit restrictions, including length of stay and associated fines. Dual nationals must use the same nationality to enter and exit the country.

### Children and travel

Children who have resident status in Peru or have been staying more than 183 days in Peru must have written permission from their non-accompanying parents to leave the country.

Children born to Canadian parents in Peru require a Peruvian passport to leave the country for the first time.
