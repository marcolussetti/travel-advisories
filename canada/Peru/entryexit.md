# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

The authorities of a country or territory decide who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Peruvian authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond the date you expect to leave Peru.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Visas

Tourist visa: not required for a stay of less than 90 days per 365 day period  
Business visa: required   
Student visa: required

If you entered Peru with a business visa, you must obtain a certificate from the Peruvian Ministry of the Economy to prove that all Peruvian taxes on income earned during the trip have been paid prior to leaving the country. The certification is required even if no money was paid or earned and must be presented to the central Peruvian immigration office in Lima before departure.

### Entering the country

You must register your entry into Peru at the port of entry or checkpoint.

* Only cross the border at official checkpoints
* Ensure the immigration office at your port of entry is open at the time you intend to cross the border

### Other entry requirements

Customs officials may ask you to show them:

* a return or onward ticket
* proof that you have a place to stay
* proof that you have sufficient funds for the duration of your stay

### Ecuador entry restrictions

If you enter Ecuador from Peru through land or river borders, you must present a criminal record check from your country of origin or residence. The original criminal record check and the Spanish translation must be apostilled and cover the past five years. Minors travelling with their family members are generally exempt.

If you cannot provide a criminal record check, the Ecuadorian Migration System will check to verify that you don’t have previous convictions.

### Length of stay

As a Canadian tourist, you may stay in Peru for up to 90 days in a 365-day period.

Overstaying is a criminal offence. There is a fine for each day of overstay. This fee must be paid upon exiting the country.

### Dual citizenship

Peruvian–Canadians entering Peru using their Canadian passport are subject to visit restrictions, including length of stay and associated fines. Dual nationals must use the same nationality to enter and exit the country.

### Children and travel

Travellers under 18 exiting Peru after a stay of 183 days are automatically protected by Peru’s law on minors and will require the authorization of both parents/guardians to exit the country.

Children who have resident status in Peru must have written permission from the non-accompanying parents to leave the country.

Children born of Canadian parents in Peru require a Peruvian passport to leave the country for the first time. Contact Peruvian immigration officials for more information.
