### Rainy season

The rainy season extends from November to May in the Peruvian Andes.

Seasonal flooding, mudslides and landslides can hamper overland travel, result in the closure of popular tourist areas, and reduce the provision of essential services such as utilities, emergency and medical care, food, fuel and water supplies. Roads may become impassable, rail services may be disrupted and bridges damaged.

* Stay informed of regional weather forecasts and plan accordingly
* Stay away from flooded areas
* Follow instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders

### El Niño

The complex weather phenomenon called El Niño happens at irregular intervals of 2 to 7 years. El Niño generally generates heavy rainfalls, occurring at the same time as the rainy season, from September to April.

* Keep informed of regional weather forecasts before and during your travels, and plan accordingly
* Ensure you have adequate insurance to cover the consequences of such events, including the disruption of travel plans

In case of a major fire:

* stay away from the affected area, particularly if you suffer from respiratory ailments
* monitor local media for the latest information
* follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders

#### High tides

Higher tides are experienced several times throughout the year, often after an earthquake, and may cause flooding and damage along the coast.

### Volcanoes

There are several active volcanoes in southern Peru. Some have erupted in recent years. Further eruptions could occur at any time and without warning.

Debris from erupting volcanoes may clog rivers and cause them to overflow, resulting in potential flash floods and mudslides. Volcanic ash may disrupt domestic and international flights and cause the closure of roads and bridges. The air quality may deteriorate and affect your breathing, especially if you suffer from respiratory ailments.

If you are near active volcanoes:

* always obey safety rules and advice
* follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders
* monitor local media sources for up-to-date information on volcanic activity
