## Natural disasters and climate

### Rainy season

The rainy season extends from November to May in the Peruvian Andes.

Seasonal flooding, mudslides and landslides can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services such as utilities, emergency and medical care, food, fuel and water supplies. Roads may become impassable and bridges damaged.

* Stay of regional weather forecasts and plan accordingly
* Stay away from flooded areas
* Follow instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders

### El Niño

The complex weather phenomenon called El Niño happens at irregular intervals of 2 to 7 years. El Niño generally generates heavy rainfalls, occurring at the same time as the rainy season, from November to May.

* Keep informed of regional weather forecasts before and during your travels, and plan accordingly
* Ensure you have adequate insurance to cover the consequences of such events, including the disruption of travel plans

### High tides

Higher tides are experienced several times throughout the year and may cause flooding and damage along the coast.

### Wildfires

Forest fires are common during the dry season, from June to October. Heavy smoke may deteriorate the air quality in areas near active fires.

In case of a major fire:

* stay away from the affected area, particularly if you suffer from respiratory ailments
* monitor local media for the latest information
* follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders

### Seismic activity

#### Earthquakes

Peru is located in an active seismic zone and is prone to earthquakes.

Dangerous landslides can also occur, even after minor earthquakes.

#### Tsunamis

Tsunamis can occur following seismic activity. Tsunami evacuation routes are posted along the Costa Verde in Lima and several locations on the coast.

#### Volcanoes

There are active and potentially active volcanoes in southern Peru. Debris from erupting volcanoes may clog rivers and cause them to overflow, resulting in potential flash floods and mudslides. Transportation and services may be affected. Ash clouds may cause disruptions to domestic and international flights. If you live or are travelling near active volcanoes:

* monitor levels of volcanic activity through the local media
* pay careful attention to all warnings issued and follow the advice of local authorities
* Be prepared to modify your travel arrangements or even evacuate the area on short notice
