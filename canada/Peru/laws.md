## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Transfer to a Canadian prison

Canada and Peru are Parties to the Treaty between the Government of Canada and the Government of the Republic of Peru on the Execution of Penal Sentences. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in Peru to request a transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both Canadian and Peruvian authorities.

This process can take a long time, and there is no guarantee that the transfer will be approved by either or both sides.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect lengthy jail sentences and heavy fines.

If you are arrested in Peru, you should expect lengthy delays to resolve your case, preventive detention of several months and significant related expenses.

* Pack your own luggage and monitor it closely at all times
* Never transport other people’s packages, bags or suitcases

### Identification

You must carry photo identification at all times. Keep a photocopy of your passport in a safe place, in case it's lost or confiscated. Failure to show identification could result in detention.

### Behaviour

Peruvian authorities may impose fines and other penalties for any action considered to be disrespectful at historical and archaeological sites.

To avoid offending local sensitivities:

* behave discreetly
* respect religious and social traditions
* respect the established and published rules of the sites
* check with your travel guide or agent for the latest information

### Exports

Peruvian law strictly prohibits the export of:

* antiques and artefacts from pre-colonial civilizations
* coca products
* protected species

 Only purchase reproductions of colonial or pre-colonial art from reputable dealers and obtain documentation from Peru's National Institute of Culture.

### Photography

It is forbidden to photograph military installations.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Peru.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Peru, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Peru.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Peru, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Peruvian court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Peru to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Driving

Police officers often request drivers to pull over and present their documents. Carry identification and vehicle registration at all times. As a tourist, you may use your Canadian driver's licence for the duration of your authorized stay.

If a police officer stops you for violating traffic rules, you will receive a written document indicating the offence. Don’t pay the fine to the police directly but at a tax administration service, ‘Servicio de Administración Tributaria’, or any agency of ‘Banco de la Nación.’ If a police officer asks you to pay a percentage of the fine in cash, don’t pay it. Inform the police officer that you will pay the fine at the appropriate entity. You can check the fine online with your license plate number.

Traffic regulation is different from Canada, the legal age to drive is 18.

### Money

The currency is the Peruvian sol (PEN). The U.S. dollar is widely accepted.

You must declare upon arrival and departure if you carry more than US$10,000 or equivalent in other currencies.

Credit cards are not commonly accepted outside major cities. Many establishments will request to see a passport to confirm the identity of the person using the credit card.

ATMs are not easily accessible in small towns and they often have limits on the amount and number of daily withdrawals.
