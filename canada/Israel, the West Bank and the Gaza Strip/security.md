## Safety and security

### Information for Canadians in the Middle East

Heightened tensions in the region could pose security risks.

This may result in:

* travel disruptions, including flight cancellations and airspace closures
* military debris falling in various locations

You should:

* monitor local and international media to stay informed of the rapidly evolving situation
* follow the instructions of local authorities at all times
* be vigilant and prepared to shelter in place

If you encounter any debris or fragments:

* move away from them immediately
* contact local authorities

### Regional tensions

On November 27, 2024, a ceasefire took effect between Israel and Lebanon. The security situation in northern Israel, and along the Blue Line, remains volatile and unpredictable. Hostilities could resume at any time.

Previous attacks reached populated areas and resulted in several casualties, including civilians.

Drone, rocket and missile attacks may occur between Israel and armed groups in neighbouring countries.

Terrorist groups and lone actors continue to carry out attacks in Israel.

Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations and public areas.

If you are in Israel despite the advisory in effect:

* monitor local and international media to stay informed of the rapidly evolving situation
* identify the location of the closest bomb shelter, if available
* if there are no bomb shelters nearby, shelter in a hardened structure away from windows when air raid warning sirens are active
* follow the instructions of local authorities, including air-raid sirens and evacuation orders
* download an alert application to receive detailed information and instructions (e.g. Home Front Command)

### Hostilities in Israel and the Gaza Strip

The security situation is volatile and unpredictable in Israel and extremely dangerous in the Gaza Strip due to ongoing hostilities.

Due to infrastructure damage, there could be connectivity problems in the Gaza Strip.

### Tensions and violence in the West Bank

Tensions and violence remain high in the West Bank. Frequent military operations throughout the West Bank and terrorist attacks can lead to casualties. Bystanders have been injured or killed.

Extremist Israeli settler violence occurs frequently and civilians have been targeted.

There are several Israeli checkpoints and movement restriction measures throughout the West Bank, including curfews.

Individuals of Palestinian or Arab descent may be subject to increased scrutiny, detention, or arrest. Personal electronic devices may be searched at Israeli military checkpoints, including flying checkpoints.

You, your friends, and your family members could face detention, arrest, and/or the suspension or withdrawal of your official permits if you share information deemed to be inaccurate and sensitive by Israel. This includes content shared on social media such as political opinions. Be conscious of these potential consequences if you discuss political views online.

If you are in the West Bank:

* assess if you are currently in a safe location
* shelter in place if you can't leave the area safely
* limit your movements
* remain extremely cautious
* monitor local and international media to get the latest information
* try to keep your phone charged

### Naval blockade

The security situation along the Mediterranean coast of the Gaza Strip remains dangerous. The Israeli Navy regularly patrols the area and the Israeli security forces continue to intercept attempts to breach Israel’s naval blockade.

These incidents have resulted in:

* deaths
* injuries
* arrests
* deportations

In cases of deportation, local authorities are not obliged to notify the Canadian Embassy in Tel Aviv nor the Representative Office of Canada in Ramallah.  As a result, Canadian officials may not be able to provide you with consular assistance.

* Avoid travelling to the Gaza Strip
* Don’t attempt to break the naval blockade

#### Border areas

Border areas with Israel are particularly dangerous and heavily guarded. Landmines are present in certain areas along Israel’s borders. Some minefields have not been clearly marked or fenced.

#### Syria

Militant activity close to the Israeli barrier in the Golan Heights makes the area extremely dangerous and unstable.

Despite the United Nations-monitored buffer zone between Israel and Syria in the Golan Heights, cross-border gunfire and rocket fires occur with little or no warning. The Israel Defence Forces also conduct military operations in the area, including air strikes.

* Don’t approach the Israeli barrier along the border with Syria in the Golan Heights
* Monitor local media for information on the latest incidents
* Don’t travel east of Highway 98 except to the following cities:

+ Buq’ata
+ Mas’ada
+ Majdal
+ Ghajar

#### Egypt

The border area with Egypt is dangerous due to military operations and smuggling activities.

The Israeli Defence Forces regularly patrols the area to intercept drug smugglers resulting in frequent armed clashes.

The security situation can also deteriorate rapidly due to instability and the risk of terrorist attacks in northern Sinai.

Don’t drive on:

* Highway 10
* Highway 12
* south of the intersection of highways 10 and 12
* between Eilat and the Netafim passage

The highways are subject to closure by Israeli authorities without warning.

If you’re planning to travel near the border with Egypt despite this advisory:

* expect roadblocks and checkpoints
* be aware of your surroundings
* monitor local media to determine where military activity is occurring

#### Lebanon

There is no official international border between Israel and Lebanon. The United Nations observe the “Blue Line,” which separates the two countries, in addition to a fence constructed by Israel on its side of the Blue line. There are sporadic clashes between Israeli and Lebanese armies patrolling along the Blue line.

Landmines are present in the area.

Terrorist groups based in southern Lebanon have fired several rockets from Lebanon into northern Israel, resulting in retaliatory air strikes by the Israel Defence Forces. Further incidents could occur without notice.

Rockets fired from Lebanon have targeted areas near several cities in northern Israel, including:

* Haifa
* Kiryat Shmona
* Shlomi
* Metula
* Metzuba
* Betzet
* Hanita
* Idmit

There are ongoing military operations in the following areas:

* Kfar Shouba Hills
* Shebaa Farms

If you choose to travel near the border with Lebanon despite this advisory:

* remain cautious at all times
* monitor local media for any active security alerts
* follow the advice of local authorities

### Jerusalem

Confrontations and clashes can occur in areas of Jerusalem, including parts of the Old City. Jerusalem has also seen an increased number of terrorist attacks targeting civilians.

During periods of imposed movement restrictions and on religious holidays, exacerbated tensions can lead to security incidents.

There are periodic clashes near the Al-Aqsa Mosque Mosque on the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount, especially during Ramadan.

* Avoid travel to the Old City during periods of exacerbated tensions
* Travel in groups
* Always dress conservatively

Due to recent events in Israel, West Bank and the Gaza Strip, local authorities may close or restrict access to checkpoints in and around Jerusalem.

### West Bank

The situation remains unpredictable in the West Bank. Tensions have increased in various areas. Violent clashes between Israeli settlers, Palestinians and Israeli defence and security forces frequently occur. Incidents of violence often occur along major roadways and intersections where passing vehicles may be subject to random stops at checkpoints or targeted with stone-throwing and other forms of vandalism.

There are multiple Israeli military checkpoints throughout the West Bank, where there is a greater threat of violent confrontations. Areas in the vicinity of the barrier separating Israel and the West Bank are particularly high-risk.

Due to recent events in Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, local authorities may close or restrict access to checkpoints without notice.

Frequent Israeli security operations target individuals in cities and villages throughout the West Bank. There is risk of injury to bystanders during these operations. These incidents occur most frequently in:

* Hebron
* Jenin
* Nablus
* Jericho
* Ramallah
* Bir Zeit
* Bethlehem
* Tulkarem
* Qalqiliya

Although violence is usually not common in the cities of Bethlehem, Jericho and Ramallah, there is an increase in violent incidents, especially clashes involving Palestinians, Israeli settlers, the Israeli Security Forces and the Palestinian Authority security forces.

If you are travelling to the West Bank despite the advisory in effect:

* consider alternate travel arrangements in case of a rapid deterioration in the security situation
* avoid travelling at night
* monitor local and international media

### Demonstrations and strikes

Planned and unplanned demonstrations occur regularly.

Demonstrators frequently gather across Israel to express opposition to the government in place. These demonstrations and strikes often result in disruptions to services and public transportation. They sometimes lead to violent incidents, such as vandalism and clashes between demonstrators and police. Security forces sometimes use tear gas and water cannons to disperse crowds.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Road safety

Road safety can vary considerably in Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.

#### Road conditions

Although most roads in Israel are in good condition, many roads in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank are in poor condition.

During the winter months, precipitation can cause difficult driving conditions and road closures across the territory.

Driving may also be dangerous due to:

* traffic jams and heavy traffic
* narrow, winding and mountainous roads
* flash floods in some regions

#### Driving habits

There is a high rate of road accidents due to dangerous driving habits across the territory. Drivers often drive at excessive speed and don’t always respect the right of way, especially in roundabouts.

It’s mandatory to have a high visibility vest and a warning triangle kit in your car. If you must stop on the side of the road and get out of your car, you must wear the vest and use the triangles according to the safety instructions provided.

If you plan to drive:

* always drive defensively
* plan your trip in advance, especially if you are visiting a rural area
* always carry a cell phone and charger
* familiarize yourself with the route before you travel

### Checkpoints

There are security checkpoints across the territory, mainly in the West Bank.

The Israel Defence Forces control access to the West Bank through a series of security checkpoints and the Palestinian Authority police may do so within their jurisdiction. Following incidents of politically motivated violence, the government of Israel may also establish additional checkpoints without warning and increase the intensity of vehicle checks. Additional measures may include frequent and extended closures of checkpoints at the discretion of Israeli Security Forces.

Officers may ask to see your valid documents. There is no guarantee that you may pass through security checkpoints even if you have a valid visa and authorization to enter.

During periods of religious holidays, checkpoint and border-crossing hours of operation are subject to change.

If travelling by car during your stay:

* expect multiple roadblocks and checkpoints
* be prepared to present your identification documents
* don’t pass through checkpoints without stopping, even if they appear unattended
* follow instructions of police or military officers if you get stopped

### Public transportation

#### Buses

The bus system is reliable. However, violent incidents occur occasionally in public buses and at bus stops. Attacks have resulted in deaths and injuries in the past.

If you’re travelling by bus during your stay:

* be aware of your surroundings at all times
* stay behind bollards or behind the bus stop while waiting
* stand away from large groups of people
* notify the driver of any suspicious objects or persons

#### Trains

The train network is extensive. It covers most of the territory and links major cities, such as Tel Aviv, Haifa, and Jerusalem. The Gaza Strip and some parts of the West Bank are not covered. In order to access train stations, you will have to pass a security check.

Trains in Israel are generally modern, clean and frequent.

If you’re travelling by train:

* be vigilant
* avoid travelling alone at night
* allow extra time to go through security checks
* validate your ticket to avoid fines

#### Taxis

Taxis are generally reliable in Israel and the West Bank.

In the West Bank, taxis are the easiest way of moving around.

Mobile applications are also available.

If you’re taking a taxi:

* never use shared taxis
* negotiate the fare in advance
* avoid travelling alone at night
