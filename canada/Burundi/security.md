## Safety and security

### Security situation in Bujumbura Mairie Province

The security situation in Bujumbura Mairie Province is volatile and unpredictable due to the ongoing conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The security situation could deteriorate rapidly and without warning.

If you are in Bujumbura Mairie Province or the surrounding area:

* be vigilant
* follow the instructions of local authorities

### Bubanza and Cibitoke provinces

Border security is a concern in the provinces of Bubanza and Cibitoke due to the various violent clashes in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo and occasional cross-border movement by armed groups.

Banditry, small arms trafficking, kidnappings and attacks on civilians by former soldiers, rebels and youth gangs occur.

### Political tensions

Burundi has a recent history of political violence. Politically motivated attacks involving small arms and grenades have occurred in recent years, including in Bujumbura.

### Security searches

Security forces have the authority to conduct searches at any time of homes and vehicles, in order to allegedly recover weapons. Car searches seem to be conducted randomly, usually at roadblocks. Foreigners have been subjected to both car and home searches.

To search a house, officers must present their identification card but don’t require a search warrant. Cooperate with the officer. Should you encounter problems, request to contact the Consulate in Bujumbura or the High Commission to Kenya in Nairobi.

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism. Terrorist attacks could occur at any time. Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

### Crime

Incidents of muggings at gun and knifepoint, purse snatching and pickpocketing occur. Crime is often committed by children. Criminal activity increases at night.

There is a risk of assault if you’re walking or jogging alone, particularly on roads around Lake Tanganyika. Avoid walking, driving or taking public transportation after dark anywhere in the country, including in Bujumbura.

Keep valuables, travel documents, and cash in safe locations, such as in hotel safes. Keep separate and digital copies of important documents, including your passport.

### Kidnapping

Kidnapping for ransom occurs and criminals have targeted foreigners in the past.

### Check points

There are frequent checkpoints throughout the country. Travellers have reported incidents of harassment, intimidation and physical violence at checkpoints, particularly at night.

### Identification

You should carry photo identification at all times. To limit the risk of your passport being lost or stolen, carry only a photocopy of it.

### Tourism Infrastructure and telecommunications

Tourism infrastructure are limited throughout the country. The telecommunications network is not always reliable outside the capital.

* Plan your trip accordingly
* Choose accommodation that provides adequate security
* Do not rely on your cell phone for emergency calls, especially outside the capital

### Adventure tourism

Outdoor activities, such as zip lining,  swimming, paragliding, hiking, cycling, etc. and other adventure activities can be dangerous if unprepared. Trails are not always marked, and weather conditions can change rapidly, even during summer.

Tour operators may not always adhere to international safety standards.

If you intend to practice adventure tourism:

* never do so alone, and do not part with your tour companions
* consider hiring an experienced guide from a reputable company
* obtain detailed information on your activity and on the environment in which you will be setting out
* consult residents and tour operators for information on possible hazards and safe swimming areas

### Power outages

Power outages occur regularly, especially outside the capital. They could impact essential services such as:

* public transportation
* telecommunications
* banking transactions
* the purchase of basic necessities

Not all buildings are equipped with generators.

* Plan accordingly
* Keep a supply of water, food and fuel on hand
* Make sure you always have an emergency kit on hand

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations and mass gathering occur occasionally, particularly in Bujumbura, and have the potential to turn violent. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Women’s safety

Sexual assault, including rape, is common. Be aware that in some jurisdictions, the victim is required to provide food during the perpetrator’s incarceration.

### Road safety

Road conditions vary throughout the country but is generally dangerous due to:

* unmarked and damaged roads
* limited street lights and traffic signals
* erratic and reckless driving habits

Avoid driving unless you are familiar with local conditions. If hiring a driver, make sure to do so through a reputable company.

You should travel by convoy and only during the day. Travelling outside Bujumbura puts you at higher risk.

If you must drive:

* always respect security rules and procedures
* check information on road security on a daily basis
* carry multiple spare tires

During the rainy season, many roads are only accessible with four-wheel-drive vehicles.

Service stations are rare, fuel shortages are frequent and roadside assistance is not available outside the capital.

In the event of an accident, leave the scene without stopping and go to the nearest police station or, if necessary, to the hospital.

You may encounter legitimate roadblocks. Be aware, however, that criminals are known to impersonate security forces and set up unofficial roadblocks to solicit bribes.

### Public transportation

Avoid using taxis. Drivers often operate within a criminal network. If the use of a taxi is unavoidable, hire one from a reputable company.

You should also avoid using public buses. Vehicle and road conditions are the cause of frequent and serious accidents.

We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.
