## Safety and security

### Political instability

The political and security situation in Niger remains unpredictable since the military-led coup d’État against the democratically elected government, which took place on July 26, 2023. The ousted President remains in captivity in Niamey.

There is a heightened military presence near government buildings, including at the Presidential Palace on Boulevard de la République.

The unpredictable economic situation and potential supply disruptions may result in shortages of necessities.

* Keep a supply of water, food, medicine and cash on hand
* Monitor local and international media to stay informed on the evolving situation

If you are in Niger:

* have evacuation plans that do not rely on Canadian government assistance
* exercise caution and be aware of your surroundings
* avoid areas near government buildings, groups of security forces and where large gatherings are taking place

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations take place regularly in Niamey, especially in relation to the presence of Western foreign forces in Niger. Security forces may use tear gas to disperse crowds.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Niamey

Crime and the risk of kidnapping pose a threat.

* After dark, be extremely vigilant and limit or avoid your movements
* Travel between the airport and Niamey only in a convoy of at least two vehicles

### State of emergency

A state of emergency and/or movement restriction measures are in effect in many regions throughout Niger.

Follow the instructions of local authorities, including curfew orders in the affected areas.

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Crime occurs throughout the country, including in the capital. Common crimes include muggings, theft and armed assaults. In Niamey, petty crimes such as pickpocketing and purse snatching also occur.

#### Robberies

Home invasions and car jackings occur periodically. Many thieves specifically target foreign nationals.

Bandits operate freely in certain isolated regions of the country. There is a heightened risk of armed robberies in areas north of the Tahoua–Zinder–Diffa axis.

* Avoid walking after dark
* Don’t display any sign of wealth or affluence in public
* Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Safely store photocopies of passports, visas and travel documents in case of loss or seizure

### Road safety

Except for main routes, road conditions are poor throughout Niger.

Road hazards include aggressive drivers, bicycles, mopeds, pedestrians, roaming farm animals, slow-moving carts and broken-down vehicles.

In case of an accident, go to the nearest police station to file a report.

Emergency roadside or medical assistance is not available.

### Travelling outside of Niamey

Don’t travel after dark. Nighttime attacks on tourists have occurred in most of the country, particularly on the Agadez–Arlit, Agadez–Tahoua and Tillabéry–Niamey roads and within the city of Zinder. In particular, avoid off-road driving in the northern region of Agadez due to residual landmines.

If you must travel outside of Niamey despite the advisory:

* do so only during daylight hours
* travel in a convoy of several vehicles in excellent mechanical condition
* be accompanied by an experienced driver at all times
* don’t leave the main roads
* bring sufficient supplies of food and water, and a medical kit
* lock car doors and keep windows shut at all times
* carry a satellite phone, especially when travelling in remote areas

### Fraud

Fraud and scams are commonplace. They may present as romance and friendship, business ventures, loan requests or employment opportunities. They can pose serious financial risk to targeted victims. Proceed with great caution when considering such proposals.

### Kidnapping

There’s a high threat of kidnapping from terrorist groups throughout Niger. This includes the capital, Niamey.

Terrorist groups and bandits have kidnapped foreign nationals.

* Don’t travel to isolated areas, particularly to the regions around Agadez, Arlit, Tahoua and Tillabéry and in Zinder
* Avoid the regions bordering Mali and Burkina Faso
* Use varied and unpredictable routes and schedules when moving from one place to another
* Limit your movements
* Avoid travelling after dark
* Remain extremely vigilant at all times

### Terrorism

There’s a threat of terrorism. In July 2024, terrorists attacked a village near the border with Burkina Faso.

Additional attacks are likely to occur, especially in border areas.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including police stations
* Schools, including universities
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels, tourist attractions and other sites frequented by foreigners
* cultural venues

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

Be particularly vigilant during:

* sporting events
* religious holidays
* public celebrations
* major political events, such as elections

Terrorists may use such occasions to mount attacks.

### Public transportation

Avoid using public transportation, including transportation organized by hotels.

Most taxis are in poor condition and don’t meet basic safety standards.

You should consider hiring a driver, for safety and security reasons.

### Air travel

We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.
