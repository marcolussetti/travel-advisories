# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Political instability

The political and security situation in Niger remains unpredictable since the military-led coup d’État against the democratically elected government, which took place on July 26, 2023.

There is a heightened military presence near government buildings, including at the Presidential Palace on Boulevard de la République, where the ousted President remains in captivity

The unpredictable economic situation and potential supply disruptions may result in shortages of basic necessities.

* Keep a supply of water, food, medicine and cash on hand
* Monitor local and international media to stay informed on the evolving situation

If you are in Niger:

* have evacuation plans that do not rely on Canadian government assistance in case of emergency
* exercise caution and be aware of your surroundings
* avoid areas near government buildings, where groups of security forces and large gatherings are taking place

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations may occur. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Roads

#### Road safety

There are major road safety issues in Niger. Fatal accidents are common, and they often involve pedestrians. Police and emergency services assistance is limited or even unavailable in rural areas.

#### Road conditions

Except for the main roads, roads are in poor condition throughout Niger.

Roads can be dangerous due to:

* potholes
* stray animals
* numerous motorcycles and bicycles
* lack of traffic signs
* pedestrians on the road
* insufficient lighting and vehicles not using their headlights
* floods and landslides during the rainy season
* poorly maintained vehicles

#### Driving habits

Drivers often disregard traffic laws and speeding is common. Pedestrians and other drivers’ rights of way are not respected.

If you choose to drive in Niger:

* always drive defensively
* always keep doors and windows closed and locked
* consider using a four-wheel-drive vehicle outside urban centres
* fill your gas tank before you travel
* during the rainy season, confirm that the chosen route is passable

#### Travelling outside of Niamey

Tourists travelling at night have been attacked almost everywhere in the country, particularly on the roads connecting Agadez to Arlit, Agadez to Tahoua, and Tillabéry to Niamey, as well as in the city of Zinder. Off-road driving should be avoided in the region north of Agadez due to the presence of landmines. If you must travel outside of Niamey despite the advisory:

* do so only during daylight hours
* travel in a convoy of several vehicles in excellent mechanical condition
* be accompanied by an experienced driver at all times
* do not leave the main roads
* bring sufficient supplies of food and water, and a medical kit

Police and military checkpoints are common throughout the country.

* Be prepared to show your identification

* Remain calm and courteous

If you are asked to pay a fine on the spot for a traffic violation, ask for a copy of the written fine that can be paid later, or insist on going to the nearest police station.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

The Charter for the Rebuilding of the State of Niger currently in force criminalizes homosexuality and any behavior considered “unnatural.” Those found guilty face fines and prison sentences.

2SLGBTQI+ persons can be victims of discrimination, harassment and acts of violence based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression or sexual characteristics.

2SLGBTQI+ persons should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Niger.
