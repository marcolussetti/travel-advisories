## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Death penalty

The death penalty may be imposed for more than two dozen criminal offences, including:

* drug trafficking
* murder
* illegal gathering
* blasphemy
* rape

Executions in Pakistan occur by hanging.

### Drugs and alcohol

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect the death penalty, jail sentences, heavy fines and/or deportation.

The possession and consumption of alcohol is prohibited. Transgressors may be punished by detention or other penalties.

### Religious proselytizing

Religious proselytizing is not permitted and may lead to accusations of blasphemy, which is considered a capital crime.

### Others illegal activities

The following activities are illegal in Pakistan and punishable by heavy fines or jail time:

* trafficking or eating pork
* importing pornographic material
* engaging in prostitution
* heterosexual couples to live together without being married
* photographing government buildings, military installations, infrastructure and airports (even from an aircraft)

### Identification

Local authorities may ask you to show identification at any time.

* Carry photo identification at all times
* Keep a photocopy of your passport and visa or residence permit in a safe place, in case they are lost or confiscated

### Photography

Ask permission before taking photographs of local residents.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Pakistan.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Pakistan, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

[Dual citizens](http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/documents/dual-citizenship)

If you were born in Pakistan, and one of your parents is a Pakistani citizen, you should confirm your citizenship status with the High Commission of Pakistan in Ottawa as you could be considered a Pakistani citizen while in Pakistan.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Pakistan.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Pakistan by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Pakistan to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Family Law

Pakistani family law is very different from Canadian law.

In case of dispute, consult a local lawyer to be fully aware of local laws regarding custody, guardianship and visitation rights.

### Dress and behaviour

The country's customs, laws and regulations adhere closely to Islamic practices and beliefs.

To avoid offending local sensitivities:

* dress conservatively
* behave discreetly
* respect religious and social traditions

Shorts are considered inappropriate attire for both men and women, particularly in remote locations. Women should consider carrying a headscarf with them at all times while travelling in Pakistan.

Couples should avoid physical contact, such as holding hands, in public.

### Ramadan

In 2025, the lunar month of Ramadan is expected to begin on or around February 28.

In public, between sunrise and sunset, refrain from:

* drinking
* eating
* smoking

### Driving

Vehicles drive on the left.

You should carry an International Driving Permit.

### Money

The currency is the Pakistani rupee (PKR).

The economy is primarily cash based. Credit cards are accepted by some larger establishments.

Currency can be exchanged at all international airports. ATMs are available in main cities but may not accept foreign debit cards.

* Plan accordingly
* Make sure you have access to sufficient local currency while in the country

These policies and restrictions may change. Consult with financial authorities such as the [State Bank of Pakistan](https://www.sbp.org.pk/index.html) before you travel.
