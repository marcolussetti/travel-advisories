# Safety and security

## Safety and security

The Government of Canada may not be in a position to provide consular assistance to Canadians in areas where:

* there are serious security concerns
* the Government of Pakistan prohibits entry
* advance permission is required for entry

### Tensions along the Pakistan–Afghanistan border

On February 26, 2026, tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan have escalated in coordinated cross border attacks.

Pakistan carried out airstrikes on targets in Kabul and in multiple Afghan provinces. Pakistani authorities also reported that drones were intercepted and destroyed. Retaliatory terrorist attacks could also occur at any time in Pakistan.

The situation remains highly volatile, and further strikes may occur with no warning, including beyond border areas.

If you decide to travel near the border with Afghanistan despite this advisory:

* expect military activity, including airstrikes and the presence of drones
* monitor local media, as the security situation may further deteriorate
* follow the instructions of local authorities and be prepared to leave the area immediately if tensions escalate further

### Security situation

Security forces continue to be on high alert in the following cities:

* Islamabad
* Rawalpindi
* Lahore
* Karachi, including the port and international airport

The security situation is evolving and remains unpredictable.

* Communication networks may be disrupted
* Roadblocks could lead to significant disruptions to traffic and public transportation, including transit routes to airports

If you are in Pakistan:

* avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* always be aware of your surroundings when in public places
* carry photo identification at all times
* expect an increased presence of security forces
* be prepared to change your travel plans on short notice
* monitor local media to stay informed on the evolving situation
* follow the instructions of local authorities, including curfew orders

### Border area with India

The level of tension between Pakistan and India is susceptible to sudden changes. You could experience difficulties when travelling between the two countries and may be subject to scrutiny if officials from either country become aware that you have recently travelled to the other.

The security situation in the Kashmir region, especially along the Line of Control (LoC), which separates India-administered Kashmir in the south from Pakistan-administered Kashmir in the north, and along the working boundary that continues south toward Sialkot, remains volatile. Since September 2016, cross-border gunfire and shelling have been occurring sporadically along the LoC.

In May 2025, the Indian military conducted airstrikes on several targets in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and Punjab Province, resulting in casualties. After three days, the Pakistani and Indian governments agreed to stop military action.

The Wagah border crossing is currently closed.

### Border areas with Afghanistan, China and Iran

Border areas with Afghanistan, China and Iran often experience terrorist activity, smuggling and violence. With the exception of official border crossings, foreigners are prohibited from travelling within 50 kilometres of the border with Afghanistan.

Bandits in border areas with Afghanistan and Iran are usually involved in drug trafficking.

Sistan-Baluchistan in Iran, which borders Pakistan, is regularly affected by ethnic conflicts and is also a known route for smugglers. Foreign nationals have been the target of kidnappings.

Terrorist attacks may also occur in this province.

If you decide to travel overland to Iran and Afghanistan despite this warning:

* travel only on main roads
* travel in organized groups
* avoid travel after dark

### Balochistan

The security situation in the province of Balochistan remains unstable, due to a long-standing nationalist insurgency and government counter-insurgency operations. Insurgents and militants may target commercial spaces and foreigners, in particular those associated with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Attacks on police and security forces occur frequently and have increased recently. Balochistan, which borders Iran and Afghanistan, is also a known route for smugglers.

### Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province

The security situation in Central and Western Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Province, including its capital Peshawar is unstable due to terrorism, sectarian and political violence and high levels of crime. North Waziristan, South Waziristan, and the Khyber District are particularly volatile and continue to be impacted by the security situation in Afghanistan. Attacks on security and military forces occur frequently. Civil unrest also takes place regularly.

### Karachi

Certain sectors of Karachi experience high levels of violence. These include:

* Lyari
* Malir
* Quaidabad
* Orangi Town

Extremist groups are present in some parts of the city and there have been terrorist attacks in recent years on high-profile targets, including the Stock Exchange and Chinese Consulate. Carefully plan any travel to, or in the city. Strikes and protest marches tend to take place in central areas of Karachi. These events may cause travel disruptions throughout the city and lead to violent civil unrest. Other criminal activities and violence that can occur in Karachi include carjacking, armed robbery, kidnapping and murder.

### Gilgit-Baltistan

Clashes between protesters and security forces have occurred. Past demonstrations have led to traffic and public transport disruptions. Do not travel by road to Gilgit-Baltistan province.

### Chitral

Many parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province are unstable due to terrorism, violence, and crime rates, including Upper and Lower Chitral districts. Do not travel by road to this area.

### Terrorism

There is a high threat of terrorism in Pakistan. The security situation is fragile and unpredictable. Several terrorist groups are present and operate across the country. Incidents are typically attributed to extremism, ethnic divisions, sectarian strife, regional political disputes and the situation in neighbouring Afghanistan. Bombings, shootings and other terrorist attacks have been directed at a wide range of targets and have caused many deaths and injuries.

In the formerly Federal Administered Tribal Area (FATA) and in the province of Balochistan, attacks are frequent and are often directed at security and military forces.

Further attacks are likely. Attacks can take many forms, including:

* targeted killings and kidnappings
* armed assaults
* suicide bombings
* improvised explosive devices

Some attacks involve detailed planning to maximize casualties through multiple and consecutive explosions. Targets could include:

* sects or minority groups
* government and military assets and personnel
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners
* elections-related events and polling stations
* civil aviation facilities, including aircrafts

There is an increased risk of attack during religious holidays and days of national significance, such as:

* National Day (March 23)
* Independence Day (August 14)
* the Islamic month of Muharram (particularly on the day of Ashura)
* the Muslim holidays of Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha

Expect heightened security measures and associated disruptions during these periods.

#### Islamabad

In Islamabad, you should:

* keep a low profile, particularly in areas regularly frequented by foreigners
* avoid the Lal Masjid Mosque (also known as the Red Mosque)
* be particularly cautious in or around western-style restaurants and shopping centres
* only stay in hotels that have stringent security measures in place, including metal detectors and closed security perimeters

### Military activity

Stay away from areas where military or militant activity is taking place.

### Crime

#### Kidnapping

The risk of kidnapping for ransom is high, especially in Balochistan, Punjab and Sindh. Pakistani citizens are particularly at risk. Express kidnapping also takes place.

* Use varied and unpredictable routes and schedules when moving from one place to another
* Maintain a high level of vigilance at all times

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs. Cell phones, credit cards and passports are favourite targets. Credit card fraud is common.

* Ensure that your personal belongings, passports other travel documents are secure at all times
* Avoid showing signs of affluence
* If travelling by car, keep valuable belongings out of sight, windows closed and doors locked
* Avoid travelling after dusk, particularly in rural areas where road conditions are unsafe
* Make arrangements to be met at the airport, especially if arriving after dark
* Verify flight and airport operation details before travelling
* Remain aware of the security situation on routes to and from airports

### Demonstrations and civil unrest

Demonstrations take place regularly. Demonstrations can take place without warning, and some may take on an anti-western tone. They have the potential to suddenly turn violent. Deaths, injuries and widespread violence have occurred at such events. Demonstrations can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Women's safety

Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse. Gender-based violence is common in Pakistan. Honour killings and forced marriages are frequently reported.

If you are the victim of a sexual assault, you should report it immediately to the nearest Government of Canada office.

* Avoid travelling alone, especially at night
* Remain particularly vigilant in less-frequented areas
* Be careful when dealing with strangers or recent acquaintances

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

2SLGBTQI+ persons could be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression or sex characteristics. Human rights organizations have reported discrimination and violence being committed against 2SLGBTQI+ persons in Pakistan, including the denial of basic rights and services, sexual violence and murder. Many hotels and similar establishments may only allow “married couples” to stay together, and same-sex couples should be prepared to stay separately while travelling.

There are no laws in Pakistan to prohibit public or private sector discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Pakistani law prohibits sexual acts between individuals of the same sex. Those convicted can be fined, face up to life imprisonment or the death penalty.

2SLGBTQI+ persons should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Pakistan.

### Forced marriages

Forced marriage affecting foreigners occurs. It sometimes occurs without the affected person's prior knowledge or consent.

Some Canadians have been forced into marital arrangements and have been detained against their will. They have been subjected to threats, intimidation and violence by family members.

#### If you're in Canada

If you're in Canada and you believe that you're being forced to travel overseas or to marry, you should call your local police for assistance.

#### If you're in Pakistan

If you're in Pakistan and you believe that you're being forced to marry, contact the High Commission of Canada to Pakistan in Islamabad. You may also contact the [Emergency Watch and Response Centre](https://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-assistance).

Family members may retain passports to prevent victims from returning to Canada.

* Keep digital or physical copies of your travel documents in a safe place
* [General information and advice about forced marriage](https://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/forced-marriage)

### Fraud

Business deals can involve extortion and corruption. All business disputes, including those involving criminality, are subject to Pakistani legal proceedings. The High Commission of Canada cannot intervene on a Canadian's behalf in a private legal matter.

### Trekking and climbing

No trekking is allowed in the closed zones located near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border and near the Line of Control between Pakistan- and India-administered Kashmir. Trekking permits are required by the Government of Pakistan for peaks over 6000m, and in most national parks. Access to roads are limited, and often in very poor condition.

Only experienced climbers should go to the northern mountains of the Himalayas, Hindukush or Karakoram. Because of their great height, the Karakoram Mountains experience heavy glaciation, particularly on the southern, more humid slopes.

If you intend on engaging in trekking activities:

* never do so alone and always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation from remote areas
* confirm that the air ambulance firm contracted has a local agent in Pakistan who can ensure that local rescue teams provide the required emergency services
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* ensure that you're properly equipped and well informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary, including when you expect to be back to camp
* know the symptoms of high-altitude illnesses, which can be fatal
* obtain detailed information on trekking routes or ski slopes before setting out and don't venture off marked trails or slopes

In case of air evacuation, advance payment of the total evacuation cost is required from the insurance company before rescue teams will perform rescue operations. The Government of Canada is unable to intervene, provide, or pay for rescue services.

### Road travel

#### Road conditions

In many urban areas, roads may be narrow, crowded and poorly lit, with limited signage and poor maintenance. Outside major highways and main cities, roads are mostly unpaved and four-wheel drive vehicles may be necessary.

Mountain roads may have steep drops and lack safety barriers.

Weather conditions can change quickly, particularly during winter. Snow, ice, fog, rain can lead to dangerous driving conditions and disrupt travel. Landslides caused by heavy rain can block or wash away roads.

* Check local news and weather reports along your route before you travel

#### Driving habits

Drivers can be aggressive and reckless, and they do not respect traffic laws. Accidents are common. If an accident occurs and you feel that your safety is threatened, leave the area and report the accident to the nearest police station.

Checkpoints may be set up without warning.

#### Karakoram highway/Northern region

Sections can be very narrow with precipitous drops and are sometimes partially obstructed by rock and earth slides.

* Travel on mountain roads only during daylight hours
* Consult local authorities regarding road openings, particularly during the monsoon rains and winter seasons
* Avoid the section of the Karakoram Highway from Mansehra to Chilas

If you chose to drive in Pakistan:

* avoid driving after dark
* keep doors locked and windows up at all times
* leave a travel itinerary with a third party
* carry photo identification to present at police checkpoints
* be well prepared and equipped with gasoline, water, food and a cell phone
* call the police if involved in an accident

### Public transportation

There are frequent rail accidents due to low safety and maintenance standards. Railways have been targets for riots and terrorist attacks.

Avoid using public transportation including taxis and trains. If you must use public transportation:

* use bus lines that provide two drivers if you're travelling long distances
* use radio-controlled taxis from reputable companies
* consider using taxi hailing apps in major cities
