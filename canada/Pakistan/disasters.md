## Natural disasters and climate

### Climate change

Climate change is affecting Pakistan. Extreme and unusual weather events are becoming more frequent, such as:

* avalanches
* cyclones
* dust storms
* earthquakes
* floods
* landslides

Extreme temperatures can occur in both summer and winter. Monitor local news to stay informed on the current situation.

### Air pollution

Smoke haze and other types of air pollution can reach extremely hazardous levels, especially in urban areas. Air pollution is typically worse in winter. In rural areas, air quality can be affected by agricultural burning.

Monitor air pollution levels, which change quickly, especially if you suffer from respiratory ailments or have pre-existing medical conditions.

During periods of high pollution:

* limit your activities outdoors
* monitor local media
* follow the instructions of local authorities

### Seismic activity

Severe earthquakes can occur in the western and northern regions of the country. Landslides are possible in affected areas, and strong aftershocks may occur after the initial quake. Transportation, health and telecommunications services may be affected, and land travel could be disrupted.

* Monitor local news reports
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Consult advisories from the provincial disaster management authorities

### Monsoon and cyclones

The rainy (or monsoon) season extends from June to September. Seasonal flooding can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services. It can also lead to landslides. Roads may become impassable and bridges damaged.

Flash flooding can occur, including in densely populated areas. There is a risk of flooding along rivers, including the Indus River.

Pakistan's coastline is subject to tropical cyclones, which are usually accompanied by high winds and heavy rain. During any storm, flash floods and mudslides as well as damage to transportation routes and infrastructure may occur.
