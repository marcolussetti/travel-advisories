# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

The authorities of a country or territory decide who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Uzbek authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid at least 6 months before entering Uzbekistan.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with a “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

You should also be aware that current systems used by some countries and travel companies may not recognize the “X” gender identifier. You may still be asked to provide your sex/gender information as either male or female when travelling.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Overland travel

When travelling by rail or road in Uzbekistan, it is sometimes necessary to cross into neighbouring countries. To avoid complications, make sure you have a multi-entry visa for Uzbekistan and any visa required for entry into these countries.

### Registration

You must register with the local authorities if you intend to stay for more than 3 days. Hotel staff normally registers guests when they check-in. The registration slip may be requested upon leaving Uzbekistan.

Travel to certain tourist areas, including in the Surkhandarya region, requires special permission from the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
