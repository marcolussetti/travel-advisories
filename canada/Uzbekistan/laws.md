You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Drugs

### Medication

Uzbekistan's customs authorities strictly control the import of medicines and pharmaceutical products and quotas are imposed.

You must declare to customs if you have narcotics or psychotropic substances in your possession.

The law also requires you to present a letter from your doctor declaring:

* your diagnosis
* your prescription’s name
* the dosage
* how long you must take the medication for

You must also present the original prescription to customs officers.

If you fail to declare the drugs in your possession at customs, you could face:

* heavy fines
* confiscation of your medication
* detention

### Identification

You should carry photo identification at all times, such as a passport, but keep a photocopy in a safe place, in case it is lost or confiscated.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

The laws of Uzbekistan prohibit sexual acts between individuals of the same sex.

2SLGBTQI+ persons should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Uzbekistan.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Uzbekistan.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of Uzbekistan, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Uzbekistan.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Uzbekistan, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Uzbek court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Uzbekistan to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Driving

You must be at least 18 years old to drive a car in Uzbekistan, but certain car rental agencies impose the minimal age at 21 years old.

Using a cell phone while driving is prohibited.

Police officers rarely speak English.

Numerous roadside cameras have been installed to help enforce traffic regulations. You could receive heavy fines if you drive above the speed limit or don’t comply with the Highway Code.

A Canadian driver’s licence alone is not acceptable to drive in Uzbekistan. You must carry an international driving permit.

### Religious proselytism

Religious proselytizing and certain religious activities are illegal in Uzbekistan, including:

* wearing religious attire in public

If you engage in illegal religious activities, you could face:

### Dress and behaviour

Islamic practices and beliefs are closely adhered to, particularly in rural areas.

To avoid offending local sensitivities:

* dress conservatively
* behave discreetly
* respect religious and social traditions

### Ramadan

In 2026, the lunar month of Ramadan is expected to begin on or around February 17.

In public, between sunrise and sunset, be discreet when:

* drinking
* eating
* smoking

### Money

The currency of Uzbekistan is the Uzbekistani sum (UZS), which is used for most transactions.

You may also be able to use U.S. dollars. Carry bills that are in good shape, as worn U.S. bills may not be accepted by stores and banks.

Credit cards are not widely accepted, except in larger hotels, restaurants and cafés in major cities.

You can exchange money at official exchange counters at international airports or at any bank and major hotel, but Canadian dollars cannot be exchanged in Uzbekistan.

There are ATMs throughout Uzbekistan, but they are more prevalent in larger cities. The majority dispense Uzbekistani sums and don’t accept international cards, but some ATMs provide U.S. dollars. It is common that ATMs run out of cash.

Purchasing money on the black market is illegal and may result in extortion or jail sentences.

### Foreign currency declaration

There are no restrictions on the amount of foreign currency you can import. However, you must declare any foreign currency equivalent to more than 2,000 USD.
