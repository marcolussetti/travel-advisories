Hepatitis A

There is a risk of [hepatitis A](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/hepatitis-a.html) in this destination. It is a disease of the liver. People can get hepatitis A if they ingest contaminated food or water, eat foods prepared by an infectious person, or if they have close physical contact (such as oral-anal sex) with an infectious person, although casual contact among people does not spread the virus.

Practise [safe food and water precautions](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/food-water) and wash your hands often. Vaccination is recommended for all travellers to areas where hepatitis A is present.

Rabies 

In this destination, [rabies](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/diseases/rabies) is commonly carried by dogs and some wildlife, including bats. Rabies is a deadly disease that spreads to humans primarily through bites or scratches from an infected animal. While travelling, take [precautions](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/rabies/prevention.html), including keeping your distance from animals (including free-roaming dogs), and closely supervising children.

If you are bitten or scratched by a dog or other animal while travelling, immediately wash the wound with soap and clean water and see a health care professional. **In this destination, rabies treatment may be limited or may not be available, therefore you may need to return to Canada for treatment.**

Before travel, discuss rabies vaccination with a health care professional. It may be recommended for travellers who are at high risk of exposure (e.g., occupational risk such as veterinarians and wildlife workers, children, adventure travellers and spelunkers, and others in close contact with animals).

Measles 

Measles is a serious viral infection that spreads easily. It spreads through the air, and can stay in the air for up to 2 hours. You can also get measles by direct contact with an infected person or by touching a surface with the virus on it and then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth before washing your hands.

Getting vaccinated is the best way to protect yourself and others from measles. In Canada, the measles vaccine is part of the routine immunization schedule. If you’re unsure whether you’re protected, talk to a healthcare provider.

Hepatitis B

[Hepatitis B](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/hepatitis-b.html) is a risk in every destination. It is a viral liver disease that is easily transmitted from one person to another through exposure to blood and body fluids containing the hepatitis B virus.  Travellers who may be exposed to blood or other bodily fluids (e.g., through sexual contact, medical treatment, sharing needles, tattooing, acupuncture or occupational exposure) are at higher risk of getting hepatitis B.

Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all travellers. [Prevent hepatitis B](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/hepatitis-b/prevention-risks.html#a2) infection by practicing safe sex, only using new and sterile drug equipment, and only getting tattoos and piercings in settings that follow public health regulations and standards.

COVID-19

COVID-19 is an infectious viral disease. Most of the time, it spreads when people are in close contact with others who are infected with the virus. It spreads through respiratory particles, or through an infected surface or object.

Vaccination is one of the most important ways to protect yourself from developing serious complications from COVID-19. Talk to a healthcare provider about the COVID-19 vaccine before travelling. Evidence shows that the COVID-19 vaccines used in Canada are very effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19.

In addition to vaccination, use personal protective measures to help protect yourself and others.

[COVID-19: Spread, prevention and risks](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks.html#p)

Influenza

 The best way to protect yourself from seasonal [influenza](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/flu-influenza.html) (flu) is to get vaccinated every year. [Get the flu shot](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/flu-influenza/get-your-flu-shot.html) at least 2 weeks before travelling.

 The flu occurs worldwide.

* In the Northern Hemisphere, the flu season usually runs from November to   April.
* In the Southern Hemisphere, the flu season usually runs between April and   October.
* In the tropics, there is flu activity year round.

The flu vaccine available in one hemisphere may only offer partial protection against the flu in the other hemisphere.

The flu virus spreads from person to person when they cough or sneeze or by touching objects and surfaces that have been contaminated with the virus. Clean your hands often and wear a mask if you have a fever or respiratory symptoms.

### Food and Water-borne Diseases

Travellers to any destination in the world can develop [travellers' diarrhea](http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/diseases/diarrhea) from consuming contaminated water or food.

In some areas in Central Asia, food and water can also carry diseases like [hepatitis A](http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/diseases/hepatitis-a) and [typhoid](http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/diseases/typhoid). Practise [safe food and water precautions](http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/food-water) while travelling in Central Asia. ***Remember: Boil it, cook it, peel it, or leave it!***

Travellers' diarrhea

[Travellers' diarrhea](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/diarrhea.html) is the most common illness affecting travellers. It is spread from eating or drinking contaminated food or water.

Risk of developing travellers' diarrhea increases when travelling in regions with poor standards of hygiene and sanitation. Practise safe food and water precautions.

The most important treatment for travellers' diarrhea is rehydration (drinking lots of fluids). Carry oral rehydration salts when travelling.

Typhoid 

[Typhoid](http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/diseases/typhoid) is a bacterial infection spread by contaminated food or water. Risk is higher among children, travellers going to rural areas, travellers visiting friends and relatives or those travelling for a long period of time.

Travellers visiting regions with a risk of typhoid, especially those exposed to places with poor sanitation, should speak to a health care professional about vaccination.

### Insects and Illness

In some areas in Central Asia, certain insects carry and spread diseases like [Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs208/en/), [leishmaniasis](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/leishmaniasis.html), [Lyme disease](http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/id-mi/lyme-fs-eng.php), [malaria](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/malaria.html), and [tick-borne encephalitis](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/tick-borne-encephalitis.html).

Travellers are advised to [take precautions against bites](http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/insect-bite).

Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever

[Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs208/en/) is a viral disease that can cause fever, pain and bleeding under the skin.  In some cases, it can be fatal.  It spreads to humans through contact with infected animal blood or tissues, or from the bite of an infected tick.  Risk is generally low for most travellers. Celebrations which include the slaughtering of animals and contact with their blood and/ or tissues may increase the risk of exposure to the virus.

Protect yourself from tick bites and wear gloves or other protective clothing if you are in contact with the blood and tissues of  animals, particularly livestock. There is no vaccine available for Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever.

### Animals and Illness

Travellers are cautioned to avoid contact with animals, including dogs, monkeys, snakes, rodents, birds, and bats. Certain infections found in Central Asia, like [rabies](http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/diseases/rabies), can be shared between humans and animals.

### Person-to-Person Infections

Crowded conditions can increase your risk of certain illnesses. Remember to [wash your hands](http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hl-vs/iyh-vsv/diseases-maladies/hands-mains-eng.php) often and practice proper cough and sneeze etiquette to avoid colds, the [flu](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/flu-influenza.html) and other illnesses.

[Sexually transmitted infections (STIs)](http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/diseases/sti) and [HIV](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/hiv-aids.html) are spread through blood and bodily fluids; practise safer sex.

Tuberculosis

[Tuberculosis](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/tuberculosis.html) is an infection caused by bacteria and usually affects the lungs.

For most travellers the risk of tuberculosis is low.

Travellers who may be at high risk while travelling in regions with risk of tuberculosis should discuss pre- and post-travel options with a health care professional.

High-risk travellers include those visiting or working in prisons, refugee camps, homeless shelters, or hospitals, or travellers visiting friends and relatives.

### Medication

Some prescription medication may not be available in Uzbekistan.

Pharmacies operate with little oversight and may disregard international standards and recommendations. They sell several medications without requiring a prescription from a doctor, including narcotics.

Counterfeit and expired medicines are prevalent in Uzbekistan.

If you take prescription medication, you’re responsible for determining their legality in the country.

* Bring sufficient quantities of your medication with you
* Always keep your medication in the original container
* Pack your medication in your carry-on luggage
* Carry a copy of your prescriptions

### Medical services and facilities

Medical services and facilities are below Canadian standards and medical personnel is often not properly trained. The equipment is not adequate for serious medical procedures and often lack basic supplies, especially in rural areas.

Make sure you get travel insurance that includes coverage for medical evacuation and hospital stays.

### Keep in Mind...

The decision to travel is the sole responsibility of the traveller. The traveller is also responsible for his or her own personal safety.

Be prepared. Do not expect medical services to be the same as in Canada. Pack a [travel health kit](http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/kit), especially if you will be travelling away from major city centres.
