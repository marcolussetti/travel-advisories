# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Borders areas

Armed clashes have occurred in the mountainousarea bordering Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan*.* The situation could escalate without notice.

#### Afghanistan

The land border between Uzbekistan and Afghanistan has been closed since the Taliban takeover in 2021.

The area is heavily guarded and the Uzbek military established several checkpoints to deter smuggling, illegal crossings and other illegal activities.

In 2022, shelling from Afghanistan was reported in the Uzbek city of Termez, causing damage to several buildings.

#### Tajikistan

In 2020, Uzbekistan announced the completion of a demining operation along its border with Tajikistan.

Although no incidents have been reported since, landmines still pose a threat to your safety.

#### Kyrgyzstan

Land disputes and tensions between Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan have occurred since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. However, in early 2023, Uzbek and Kyrgyz authorities announced that they finally reached an agreement on the delimitation of their shared borders.

Kyrgyz authorities may restrict access to border crossings with Uzbekistan without warning.

You should confirm with local authorities if border posts are open for travel before heading to Kyrgyzstan.

### Landmines

Despite landmines clearing efforts, marked and unmarked minefields may still be present in areas bordering the following countries, especially in uncontrolled areas:

* Tajikistan
* Kyrgyzstan

If you are travelling to any of these areas despite the advisory in effect:

* stay on main roads and paved surfaces
* avoid roadside ditches, shoulders and unmarked trails
* cross only at official border crossings
* strictly observe warning signs indicating the possible presence of landmines

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism. Local security forces conduct operations to counter terrorist threats, which can lead to sporadic violence.

Terrorist attacks could occur at any time.

Targets could include:

* government buildings and military installations
* schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

Be particularly vigilant during:

* sporting events
* religious holidays
* public celebrations
* major political events, such as elections

Terrorists may use such occasions to mount attacks.

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, is common and home break-ins and burglaries occur. Thefts occur in crowded places, such as:

* public transportation
* public markets and bazaars
* restaurants
* bars and nightclubs

Incidents of petty crime are more frequent at night and in the following regions:

* Tashkent
* Bukhara
* Samarkand
* Ferghana

There are reports of foreigners being robbed by individuals posing as police officers.

If you’re approached:

* ask to see police credentials
* offer to go to the police station
* remain vigilant

During your stay:

* keep your car and home doors locked and windows closed at all times
* don’t leave personal items and documents in plain sight in a vehicle
* make sure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents are secure at all times
* don’t show signs of affluence
* avoid travelling alone in isolated and poorly-lit areas

### Demonstrations

Planned and unplanned demonstrations are rare and security forces tightly control crowds to prevent escalation and violence.

In 2022, the authorities intervened in large-scale demonstrations in the Karakalpakstan region over constitutional reforms. They have led to vandalism and violent clashes between demonstrators and security forces. The situation could escalate without notice.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Adventure tourism

Adventure tourism, such as zip-lining, rock climbing or trekking, can be dangerous, especially if they are not well-organized. Trails are not always marked and weather conditions can change rapidly.

Tour operators may not meet international standards.

If you are participating in adventure tourism, such as zip-lining, rock climbing, trekking, hiking, parasailing:

* never do so alone, and do not part with your tour companions
* consider hiring an experienced guide from a reputable company
* obtain detailed information on your activity and on the environment in which you will be setting out
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to tackle the challenges of your activity
* avoid venturing off marked trails
* refrain from using equipment if you have doubts on their safety
* Make sure you always have access to an emergency kit

### Power outages

Power outages, referred to as planned outages, occur regularly throughout the year and last for several hours due to the lack of natural gas supply. During winter months, the heating of buildings is difficult and the supply of drinking water is limited due to freezing temperatures.

They usually lead to long lines at grocery stores, gas stations and pharmacies.

* Plan accordingly
* Keep a supply of water, food and fuel on hand

### Road safety

#### Road conditions

Roads are generally in good condition in Tashkent, but in rural areas, particularly in the Tian Shan and Fan mountains, they are poorly maintained and dangerous due to:

* large potholes
* malfunctioning or absence of traffic lights
* insufficient lighting
* uneven surface
* bad road markings and signage

Gas stations are limited and the quality of fuel is poor in rural areas.

### Driving habits

Drivers often disregard traffic laws, including:

* sudden lane changes without signaling
* driving on the opposite side of the road and astride lanes
* stopping abruptly

Vehicles entering roundabouts have priority over those already in them.

Pedestrians often cross in the middle of the road and drivers don’t always give pedestrians the right of way.

Police frequently stop drivers for minor infractions or to verify their identification. Foreigners may face harassment, including bribes.

If you’re driving in Uzbekistan:

* always drive defensively
* avoid driving at night
* use main roads and highways as much as possible
* always carry a cellphone and a charger

### Public transportation

#### Taxis

You should avoid taking taxis in Uzbekistan. Licensed and unlicensed taxis operate in Uzbekistan, but it’s difficult to differentiate them.

Vehicles don’t always have roof-mounted taxi signs and are not always equipped with safety features like seatbelts.

Drivers are often distracted and don’t always take the shortest itinerary. Unlicensed taxis may pick up additional passengers, which poses a risk to your safety.

In major cities, there are ridesharing applications on which you can order a taxi with safer vehicles and fixed fares.

If you choose to take taxis during your stay:

* order it at the reception if you are staying at a hotel
* don’t use unmarked taxis
* never share a taxi with strangers
* confirm the fare in advance
* have small bills available for payment

#### Trains

The rail network is extensive and trains are generally modern and safe.

When travelling by rail in Uzbekistan, it is sometimes necessary to cross into neighbouring countries.

* Make sure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Make sure that you have the required travel documents to cross into neighboring countries
* Don’t leave your compartment unattended
* Keep the door locked from the inside

#### Bus

Buses operate in and between major cities. They are generally crowded and have no air conditioning. Some buses are in poor condition.

Pickpockets are common on buses.

Minibuses called "Damas vans" often lack security features like seatbelts.

* Always carry your valuables and identification with you
* Avoid storing bags in the overhead compartment or under your seat
* Don't take buses that look overloaded or in poor condition
