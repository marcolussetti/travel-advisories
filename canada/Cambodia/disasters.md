## Natural disasters and climate

### Monsoon

The rainy (or monsoon) season extends from May to November. Severe rainstorms can cause flooding and landslides, resulting in loss of life and extensive damage to infrastructure. They can also hamper the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable and bridges damaged. Flooding can affect wide areas in numerous provinces, including certain parts of Phnom Penh.

* Keep informed of regional weather forecasts
* Avoid disaster areas
* Follow the advice of local authorities
