## Natural disasters and climate

### Climate change

Climate change is affecting Cambodia. Extreme and unusual weather events are becoming more frequent and may affect your travel plans. Monitor local media for the latest information.

### Monsoons and typhoons

The rainy season (monsoon) extends from May to November. Typhoons in the region can intensify rainfall and floods during this season.

Severe rainstorms can cause flooding and landslides, resulting in loss of life and extensive damage to infrastructure. They can also hamper the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable and bridges damaged. Flooding can affect wide areas in numerous provinces, including certain parts of Phnom Penh.

* Remain vigilant, especially in areas around major rivers
* Stay away from flooded areas
* Monitor weather reports
* Monitor local media for the latest updates, including those on road conditions
* Follow the advice of local authorities, including evacuation orders
