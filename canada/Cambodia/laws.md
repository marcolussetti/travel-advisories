## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Drugs

There are severe penalties for the possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs. If you are convicted, you can expect lengthy jail sentences and steep fines.

### Expulsion, deportation and limitation of visit

Cambodian authorities can expel, deport or limit a traveller's visit if you are accused, or suspected of:

* violating local laws, which include possession of invalid entry documents and requirements
* having a criminal record
* being involved in criminal activities
* suffering from mental illness or serious transmitted diseases

### Legal process

Detention during the investigative period is common and can exceed 6 months before charges are laid.

### Illegal or restricted activities

#### Overstaying a visa

Immigration regulations are strict. You could face fines, detention and deportation if you overstay your visa. There is a daily fine for overstaying the validity of your visa. There is no limit to this fine. If you overstay more than 30 days, you will need to leave Cambodia in addition to paying the fine.

#### Exploitation of minors

There are harsh penalties for sexual exploitation of minors. It is a serious offence in Cambodia.

Canadians may also be subject to criminal proceedings in Canada for acts of this nature committed while abroad.

#### Surrogacy

All forms of commercial surrogacy are illegal in Cambodia. Penalties for surrogates, as well as operators of clinics and hospitals providing surrogacy services, may include imprisonment and/or fines. If you have already entered into a surrogacy agreement, you should seek advice from a local lawyer on how these guidelines, including its exit requirements, apply to your situation.

#### Cultural heritage and antiquities

A permit is required to purchase, export or possess cultural or archaeological artefacts.

To avoid any difficulties, make sure you obtain and carry the required legal paperwork to purchase or export antiquities.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Cambodian law doesn't prohibit sexual acts between individuals of the same sex.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Cambodia.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Cambodia, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Cambodia.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Cambodia by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Cambodia to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Driving

You must have and carry a Cambodian driver's licence.

Helmets are mandatory for motorcycle riders, but many helmets do not meet international safety standards. Ensure your medical insurance will cover you when riding as a driver or passenger.

### Dress and behaviour

There are reports of local authorities cracking down on events such as pub crawls, raves, booze cruises and pool parties, as well as other events where recreational drugs may be present. Avoid these types of events.

Behaviour that is deemed scandalous, drunken or disorderly is considered highly disrespectful to the local culture and population, especially near the Angkor temples.

To avoid offending local sensitivities:

* dress conservatively
* behave discreetly
* respect religious and social traditions
* do not photograph airports or military installations
* ask permission before photographing individuals, including Buddhist monks

### Money

The currency is the riel (KHR).

U.S. dollars are also widely used. Only newer, undamaged notes are accepted. Notes with the slightest tear will not be accepted.

Credit cards are not widely accepted outside major cities. Some banks in Phnom Penh accept certain credit cards for cash advances. There are many ATMs in Phnom Penh, Siem Reap and Sihanoukville but fewer in smaller cities.
