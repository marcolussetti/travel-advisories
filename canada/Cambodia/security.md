* remain at the scene
* report the accident to the police and your insurance company as soon as possible
* if you are found to be at fault, you may be detained until all fines are paid

#### Road conditions

The road system outside of major cities is in poor condition. Main roads are paved but secondary roads may not be. Narrow and unpaved roads affect rural driving. Conditions may be more hazardous during the rainy season.

Travel by road during daylight hours.

### Travel by motorcycle

Motorcycles are a common in urban areas. Motorcycle accidents kill or maim several Canadians in Cambodia each year.

Riding motorcycles in Cambodia as it is dangerous, even for experienced motorcyclists.

Rental agencies often request passports as a guarantee when renting motorcycles.

Confirm fares before entering a taxi, and/or request that the taxi driver use the meter.

#### Trains

Travel can be affected by the poor track maintenance and drivers trying to beat the train at crossings.
