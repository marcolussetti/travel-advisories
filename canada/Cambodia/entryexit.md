# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Cambodian authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you use for travel.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond the date of entry into Cambodia. If you wish to extend your stay in Cambodia, make sure that your passport is valid for at least 6 months beyond the extension period.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Visas

Tourist visa: required  
Business visa: required  
Student visa: required

Tourist and business visas allow entry to Cambodia for 30 days only, counting from the date of entry.

Travellers must pay a fee in cash of US$30 for tourist visas or US$35 for business visas and provide two passport-sized photos. The photos can be purchased at the airport for US$3 each.

Make sure Cambodian officials stamp your passport when you arrive. Keep your immigration card intact in your passport or put it in a safe place. You will have to contact Cambodian immigration officials if you lose your immigration card before you can leave the country.

#### E-visa

You can request a single-entry tourist visa online through Cambodia's e-Visa service.

#### Visa expiry date

When issued outside Cambodia, visas have an expiry date, which refers to the date by which the visa must be used, not the length of time allowed in the country. Visas must be renewed for stays over 30 days and may only be extended once.

#### Where to get a visa

Tourist and business visas can be obtained at:

* a Cambodian embassy abroad
* upon arrival at the airports in Phnom Penh and Siem Reap
* certain land borders as e-visas

For more information, contact the nearest Cambodian embassy or consulate.

### Other entry requirements

The trial period for the Cambodia e-Arrival application (CeA) will end on August 31, 2024. As of September 1, 2024, the electronic form in the app will replace the standard immigration, customs and health forms.

You will have to complete your e-Arrival forms (immigration, customs and health) within 7 days of your scheduled arrival.

An onward or return ticket and proof of sufficient funds are required to visit Cambodia.

### Foreigners Presence in Cambodia System (FPCS)

Cambodian immigration has required that foreign nationals in Cambodia be registered on the FPCS – an online registration system aiming to protect foreigners' safety and security in case of an emergency while living or staying in Cambodia. If you don't register, you may be denied a visa extension. Verify with your accommodation staff or owners if they have registered your information on the system. If you own your accommodation, you can self-register by downloading the mobile app.
