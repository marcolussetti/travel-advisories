# Safety and security

## Safety and security

On May 7, 2025, the Indian military conducted air strikes on several targets in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and Punjab Province, resulting in casualties. There has also been artillery fire across the Line of Control.

Tensions could increase and the situation could deteriorate rapidly.

There are air travel disruptions and local authorities could take additional measures, such as closing the airspace.

If you are in or near the affected areas:

* monitor local and international media to stay informed of the rapidly evolving situation
* follow the instructions of local authorities, including air-raid sirens and evacuation orders
* be vigilant and prepared to shelter in place

### Security situation

In the context of recent developments in Canada and in India, there are calls for protests and some negative sentiment towards Canada in traditional media and on social media. Demonstrations, including anti-Canada protests, could occur and Canadians may be subjected to intimidation or harassment. In Delhi and the National Capital Region, you should keep a low profile with strangers, and not share your personal information with them. Avoid crowded areas, including public transportation. You should always travel with someone and inform a friend or a family member of your travel plans.

Consular services in person are temporarily unavailable in and around Bengaluru, Chandigarh and Mumbai. Consular services in person at the High Commission of Canada in New Delhi will remain available.

### Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir

The security situation in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir is tense. There are high risks of violent protests, civil unrest and acts of terrorism and militancy.

Violent clashes between militants and security forces occur regularly. Terrorist attacks against security forces have led to civilian casualties. Further attacks could take place at any time. You could find yourself in the wrong place at the wrong time.

The Indian army has enhanced powers in this territory. Authorities may impose curfews and security restrictions on short notice.

* Avoid gatherings and demonstrations
* Always carry ID
* Expect a heightened security presence and security checks
* Follow the instructions of local authorities

### Border areas with Pakistan

The level of tension between India and Pakistan may change suddenly. You could experience difficulties when travelling between the two countries. You may be subject to scrutiny if officials from either country become aware that you have recently travelled to the other.

The security situation along the border with Pakistan, especially along the Line of Control (LoC), which separates the Union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh from Pakistan-administered Kashmir, remains volatile. Cross-border gunfire and shelling are occurring sporadically along the LoC. The presence of landmines and unexploded ordnance also constitute a risk.

The Attari-Wagah border crossing is currently closed.

### Parts of Northeastern India

Several extremist and insurgent groups are active in the northeastern states of Assam and Manipur. They regularly target local government and security forces and may use various criminal activities to finance their activities.

Ethnic tensions in the State can also lead to conflict and civil unrest.

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in India, particularly in:

* the Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir
* the State of Manipur
* the State of Assam
* areas of East India where Naxalites groups are active

Maoist extremist insurgents, known as Naxalites, are responsible for the majority of terrorist attacks in India. These groups are usually based in rural and forested areas within zones of concerns, as defined by the Government of India, which include:

* Andhra Pradesh
* Bihar
* Chhattisgarh
* Jharkhand
* Madhya Pradesh
* Maharashtra
* Odisha
* Telangana
* Uttar Pradesh
* West Bengal

Extremist and insurgent groups usually target government and security forces, and sometimes, trains and railway tracks. While tourists are not usually specifically targeted, bystanders could be affected. Be particularly vigilant during election periods and in the lead-up to, and during, religious holidays and times of national significance, such as:

* Republic Day (January 26)
* Eid
* Independence Day (August 15)
* Diwali

Targets of terrorist attacks could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks

While in India:

* always be aware of your surroundings when in public places
* if you see a suspicious package, immediately leave the area and report it to authorities

### Crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, is common. Criminals may target foreigners, especially in major cities and tourist areas.

* Be vigilant in all crowded locations
* Don’t carry large sums of money

Petty crime frequently occurs on public transportation and overnight trains.

* Don’t accept any offer, no matter how convincing
* Beware of offers for cheap transportation or accommodation, extended taxi rides and unsolicited guided tours

#### Romance scams

If you’re travelling to India to meet someone you’ve otherwise only met online, you may be the victim of a scam.

Be alert to attempts at fraud by persons who profess friendship or romantic interest over the internet.

Unsolicited emails offering attractive business or financial opportunities are most likely fraudulent.

Don’t travel to India to obtain restitution after losing money to a scam.

### Spiked food and drinks

Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

### Women’s safety

Crimes committed against women frequently occur in India. Foreign women are often the target of unwanted attention.

Staring, verbal abuse, groping, and other forms of sexual harassment can occur anywhere, including in tourist sites and areas. Attackers sometimes act as a group.

Reports of rape and assault against foreign women have increased. You should be particularly vigilant:

### Forced marriages

Forced marriage affecting foreigners occurs, sometimes without the affected person’s prior knowledge or consent.

Some Canadians have been forced into marital arrangements and have been detained against their will. They have been subjected to threats, intimidation and violence by family members.

#### If you’re in Canada

If you’re in Canada and you believe that you’re being forced to travel overseas to marry, you should call your local police for assistance.

#### If you’re in India

If you’re in India and you believe that you’re being forced to marry, contact the nearest office of the Government of Canada. You may also contact the [Emergency Watch and Response Centre](https://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-assistance).

Family members may retain passports to prevent victims from returning to Canada. Keep digital or physical copies of your travel documents in a safe place.

### Demonstrations and mass gatherings

### Protests in Manipur

Violent demonstrations have been taking place in Manipur State since May 3, 2023, resulting in casualties. Protests have led to disruptions to traffic and public transportation. Curfews have been imposed in several districts and mobile and internet services may be limited.

If you are in Manipur:

Demonstrations, mass gatherings, general strikes, “bandh” or “hartal,” take place frequently. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

Stampedes have occurred during mass gatherings, including religious ceremonies, and resulted in deaths and injuries.

Local authorities may impose curfews and other restrictions on short notice.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities, including curfews

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety are poor throughout the country. Most roads, including major highways, are poorly maintained. There is severe traffic congestion. Driving conditions may be hazardous during the rainy season, and some roads can become impassable.

Drivers don’t respect traffic laws. They are often aggressive or reckless. Driving can be hazardous due to the presence of livestock or wandering cows, including in urban areas.

Fatal road accidents are frequent. They can lead to mob anger and assault.

* Avoid travelling outside urban centres after dark
* Avoid driving or riding motorcycles in India, even if you are an experienced motorcyclist
* Be very careful when crossing the street, even at pedestrian crossings
* If involved in an accident, contact local authorities immediately

### Public transportation

#### Trains

India has an extensive passenger train system. Rail accidents are common, mostly due to poor maintenance. Thefts are frequent on certain train lines.

#### Taxis

If you use a taxi, get it from a reputable hotel, an official taxi stand, or a trusted ride-sharing app. At the airport, use officially marked taxis or pre-paid transport services.

* Negotiate fares in advance, or insist that the driver use the meter, as you may be overcharged
* Avoid travelling alone, especially at night
* Don’t share taxis with strangers

#### Maritime transportation

Maritime accidents occur regularly due to the overloading and poor maintenance of some vessels.

* Don’t board vessels that appear overloaded or unseaworthy
* Always wear a life jacket

### Piracy

Pirate attacks and armed robbery against ships occur in coastal waters. Mariners should take appropriate precautions.

Beaches are not usually supervised by lifeguards. Many beaches don’t display warnings of dangerous conditions.

* Seek local advice before swimming
* Avoid swimming if red flags are flown
* Avoid swimming during Monsoon season
* Always wear a life jacket if you use a boat or a small embarkation
