# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Indian authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for 6 months from your date of entry into India and must contain at least two blank pages for use by immigration officials.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

Ensure you apply for the proper type of visa for the specific purpose of your trip. If you are denied entry by immigration officials, you will be returned to your point of departure.

Canadian-Pakistani citizens are subject to different visa application and registration procedures.

You can only stay in India for up to 180 consecutive days on a tourist visa, even when its validity exceeds 180 days.

#### Residency registration

If you stay in India for more than 180 days, you must register within 14 days of arrival with the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO).

#### Penalties for overstaying

Strict penalties are enforced for overstaying. If you overstay, you could be subject to fines, detention and a future travel ban.

If you have overstayed your visa, you must request an exit visa from the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO). This process can be lengthy.

### Other entry requirements

Customs officials may ask you to show them a return or onward ticket and proof of sufficient funds to cover your stay.

### Dual citizenship

If you hold an Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) card, you must present it upon entry and exit.

### Departure

You must present a boarding pass and a photo identification to access airport departure terminals and public areas.

#### Lost or stolen passport

If your passport is lost or stolen, an exit visa is required to leave India.

To obtain an exit visa, you must present the FRRO with:

* a police report
* two current passport-size photographs
* a letter providing details of the loss or theft from the High Commission of Canada to India in New Delhi or Consulate General of Canada in either Chandigarh or Mumbai

The FRRO will verify the entry details before issuing an exit visa. This process can take several days.
