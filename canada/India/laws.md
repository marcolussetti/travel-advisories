## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect heavy fines and jail sentences. Detention during the investigation is common and can be lengthy.

#### Alcohol

Laws regarding the purchase and consumption of alcohol, including the legal drinking age, differ from state to state. Authorities often call for dry periods during:

* religious festivals
* elections
* national holidays

### Smoking

It is prohibited to import, possess or use e-cigarettes, vaporisers and their refills.

### Beef consumption

Cows are protected and venerated by several groups of faith in India.

Several states impose prohibitions on beef slaughter and consumption. In some rural areas, cow protection vigilantes have attacked people suspected of selling, consuming, or possessing beef or items made with cowhide.

Avoid consuming beef or its derived products while in India.

### Religious proselytism

In certain states, it’s illegal to engage in religious proselytism, such as preaching, possessing, or distributing religious literature or material with the intent of converting. Indian authorities require foreign missionaries to obtain a missionary visa.

If you plan to conduct religious activities in India, ensure that:

* the activities are legal
* you possess the proper visa for the activities you plan to perform

### Satellite and GPS devices

It’s illegal to carry and/or use satellite phones and GPS devices in India without a licence, even if you are only transiting through the country. This does not include regular cell phones.

### Photography

It is prohibited to take pictures of military installations, airports and dams.

Ask permission before photographing places of worship such as temples or mosques.

### Imports and exports

There are strict regulations on the importation or exportation of items such as:

* firearms
* antiquities
* electronic equipment
* local currency
* ivory and gold objects
* protected animals
* pornographic material

Among others, you must register antique items for export with local police, with a photograph of each item.

### Dress and behaviour

India is a traditional, conservative and multi-faith society. To avoid offending local sensitivities:

* Dress conservatively
* Behave discreetly
* Respect religious and social traditions
* Avoid displays of affection in public
* Avoid using footwear in places of worship

### Family law

Indian family law is very different from Canadian law.

In case of dispute, consult a local lawyer to be fully aware of local laws regarding marital fraud, dowry abuse or extortion, custody, guardianship and visitation rights. Individuals facing charges may be forced to remain in India until their cases have been settled or charges dismissed.

### Commercial surrogacy

If you’re planning to visit India to commission surrogacy arrangements, you should consider the potential challenges involved in pursuing international surrogacy. Seek specialist legal advice on Indian and Canadian laws before making any arrangements.

A proposed Indian government ban on foreign commercial surrogacy could affect Canadians travelling to India to enter into a surrogacy agreement.

You should also consult with Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) on current policies regarding citizenship through descent and the issuance of Canadian travel documents.

### Land and property disputes

If you plan on buying property or are involved in a land dispute in India, you should seek legal advice. Do so before making commitments. Related disputes could take time and be costly to resolve.

The offices of the Government of Canada in India can’t provide assistance or legal advice related to private legal matters.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Indian law doesn't criminalize sexual acts or relationships between persons of the same sex.

However, 2SLGBTQI+ persons could be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or sex characteristics.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in India.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of India, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and India.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in India by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in India to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.
