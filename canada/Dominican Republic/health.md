This section has information and advice about health risks you might face when travelling. Following this advice can help reduce your risk of getting sick. Not all risks are listed here.

It's best to talk to a healthcare provider or visit a travel health clinic preferably 6 weeks before your trip to get personalized health advice. Even if your travel date is coming up soon, it's still worthwhile to make an appointment.

### Routine vaccines

Make sure your routine vaccinations are up-to-date before you travel, no matter where you’re going.

These may include vaccines for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), polio, varicella (chickenpox), meningococcal disease, seasonal flu, and others.

[Provincial and Territorial Immunization Information](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/provincial-territorial-immunization-information.html)

### Pre-travel vaccines and medications

When travelling in this destination, you might be at risk for diseases that can be prevented with vaccines or medications. Talk to a travel health care provider about which ones are right for you based on your travel plans.

The highlights below will also tell you if your destination may require that vaccine for entering or exiting.

Hepatitis A

There is a risk of [hepatitis A](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/hepatitis-a.html) in this destination. It is a disease of the liver. People can get hepatitis A if they ingest contaminated food or water, eat foods prepared by an infectious person, or if they have close physical contact (such as oral-anal sex) with an infectious person, although casual contact among people does not spread the virus.

Practise [safe food and water precautions](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/food-water) and wash your hands often. Vaccination is recommended for all travellers to areas where hepatitis A is present.

Yellow Fever - Country Entry Requirements 

[Yellow fever](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/yellow-fever.html) is a disease caused by a flavivirus from the bite of an infected mosquito.  
  
Travellers get vaccinated either because it is required to enter a country or because it is recommended for their protection.

**Risk**

* There is no risk of yellow fever in this country.

**Country Entry Requirement\***

* Proof of vaccination is required if arriving from some states in Brazil, including travellers having transited for more than 12 hours through an airport in those same states.

**Recommendation**

* Vaccination is not recommended.

[About Yellow Fever](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/yellow-fever.html)

[Yellow Fever Vaccination Centres in Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/travel-health/yellow-fever.html#select-centre)  
\* It is important to note that [country entry requirements](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/vaccination-requirements-and-recommendations-for-international-travellers-and-malaria-situation-per-country-2022-edition) may not reflect your risk of yellow fever at your destination. It is recommended that you contact the nearest [diplomatic or consular office](http://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?view=d) of the destination(s) you will be visiting to verify any additional entry requirements.

Measles 

Measles is a serious viral infection that spreads easily. It spreads through the air, and can stay in the air for up to 2 hours. You can also get measles by direct contact with an infected person or by touching a surface with the virus on it and then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth before washing your hands.

Getting vaccinated is the best way to protect yourself and others from measles. In Canada, the measles vaccine is part of the routine immunization schedule. If you’re unsure whether you’re protected, talk to a healthcare provider.

Hepatitis B

[Hepatitis B](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/hepatitis-b.html) is a risk in every destination. It is a viral liver disease that is easily transmitted from one person to another through exposure to blood and body fluids containing the hepatitis B virus.  Travellers who may be exposed to blood or other bodily fluids (e.g., through sexual contact, medical treatment, sharing needles, tattooing, acupuncture or occupational exposure) are at higher risk of getting hepatitis B.

Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all travellers. [Prevent hepatitis B](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/hepatitis-b/prevention-risks.html#a2) infection by practicing safe sex, only using new and sterile drug equipment, and only getting tattoos and piercings in settings that follow public health regulations and standards.

COVID-19

COVID-19 is an infectious viral disease. Most of the time, it spreads when people are in close contact with others who are infected with the virus. It spreads through respiratory particles, or through an infected surface or object.

Vaccination is one of the most important ways to protect yourself from developing serious complications from COVID-19. Talk to a healthcare provider about the COVID-19 vaccine before travelling. Evidence shows that the COVID-19 vaccines used in Canada are very effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19.

In addition to vaccination, use personal protective measures to help protect yourself and others.

[COVID-19: Spread, prevention and risks](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks.html#p)

Influenza

 The best way to protect yourself from seasonal [influenza](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/flu-influenza.html) (flu) is to get vaccinated every year. [Get the flu shot](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/flu-influenza/get-your-flu-shot.html) at least 2 weeks before travelling.

 The flu occurs worldwide.

* In the Northern Hemisphere, the flu season usually runs from November to   April.
* In the Southern Hemisphere, the flu season usually runs between April and   October.
* In the tropics, there is flu activity year round.

The flu vaccine available in one hemisphere may only offer partial protection against the flu in the other hemisphere.

The flu virus spreads from person to person when they cough or sneeze or by touching objects and surfaces that have been contaminated with the virus. Clean your hands often and wear a mask if you have a fever or respiratory symptoms.

Malaria 

[Malaria](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/malaria.html) is a serious and sometimes fatal disease that is caused by parasites spread through the bites of mosquitoes.  
 

[Antimalarial medication may be recommended](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/catmat/appendix-1-malaria-risk-recommended-chemoprophylaxis-geographic-area.html) depending on your itinerary and the time of year you are travelling. Consult a health care professional or visit a travel health clinic before travelling to discuss your options. It is recommended to do this 6 weeks before travel, however, it is still a good idea any time before leaving.   
   
[Protect yourself from mosquito bites](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/insect-bite-prevention.html) at all times:   
• Cover your skin and use an [approved](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/about-pesticides/insect-repellents.html) insect repellent on uncovered skin.   
• Exclude mosquitoes from your living area with screening and/or closed, well-sealed doors and windows.  
• Use insecticide-treated bed nets if mosquitoes cannot be excluded from your living area.   
• Wear permethrin-treated clothing.   
   
If you develop [symptoms](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/malaria/symptoms-malaria.html) similar to malaria when you are travelling or up to a year after you return home, see a health care professional immediately. Tell them where you have been travelling or living.

Rabies 

In this destination, [rabies](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/diseases/rabies) is commonly carried by dogs and some wildlife, including bats. Rabies is a deadly disease that spreads to humans primarily through bites or scratches from an infected animal. While travelling, take [precautions](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/rabies/prevention.html), including keeping your distance from animals (including free-roaming dogs), and closely supervising children.

If you are bitten or scratched by a dog or other animal while travelling, immediately wash the wound with soap and clean water and see a health care professional. **In this destination, rabies treatment may be limited or may not be available, therefore you may need to return to Canada for treatment.**

Before travel, discuss rabies vaccination with a health care professional. It may be recommended for travellers who are at high risk of exposure (e.g., occupational risk such as veterinarians and wildlife workers, children, adventure travellers and spelunkers, and others in close contact with animals).

### Safe food and water precautions

Eating or drinking unsafe food or water, or swimming in contaminated water can make you sick while travelling. Take precautions by following these tips:

* Boil it, cook it, peel it, or leave it (only eat food that is prepared safely)
* Avoid, if possible, getting water in your eyes, mouth, or nose when swimming in freshwater (like streams, lakes, or canals), especially after heavy rain or flooding - the water might look clean but can still be contaminated
* Don’t swallow water when bathing, showering, swimming in pools, or using hot tubs

[Eat and drink safely abroad](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/food-water)

Cholera

**Risk**

[Cholera](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/cholera.html) is a risk in parts of this country. Most travellers are at very low risk.

To protect against cholera, all travellers should practise [safe food and water precautions](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/food-water).

Travellers at higher risk of getting cholera include those:

* visiting, working or living in areas with limited access to safe food, water and proper sanitation
* visiting areas where outbreaks are occurring

Vaccination may be recommended for high-risk travellers, and should be discussed with a health care professional.

Travellers' diarrhea

[Travellers' diarrhea](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/diarrhea.html) is the most common illness affecting travellers. It is spread from eating or drinking contaminated food or water.

Risk of developing travellers' diarrhea increases when travelling in regions with poor standards of hygiene and sanitation. Practise safe food and water precautions.

The most important treatment for travellers' diarrhea is rehydration (drinking lots of fluids). Carry oral rehydration salts when travelling.

Typhoid 

[Typhoid](http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/diseases/typhoid) is a bacterial infection spread by contaminated food or water. Risk is higher among children, travellers going to rural areas, travellers visiting friends and relatives or those travelling for a long period of time.

Travellers visiting regions with a risk of typhoid, especially those exposed to places with poor sanitation, should speak to a health care professional about vaccination.

Salmonellosis

[Salmonellosis](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/salmonellosis-salmonella.html) is a common illness among travellers to this country. It can be spread through contaminated food or beverages, such as raw or undercooked poultry and eggs, as well as fruits or vegetables.

[Practice safe food and water precautions](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/salmonellosis-salmonella/prevention.html). This includes only eating food that is properly cooked and still hot when served.

Pregnant women, children under 5 years of age, those over 60 years of age, and those with weakened immune systems are at greater risk of becoming seriously ill.

Most people recover on their own without medical treatment and from proper rehydration (drinking lots of fluids).

* + Carry [oral rehydration salts](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/rehydration) when travelling.

Travellers with severe symptoms should consult a health care professional as soon as possible.

### Tick and insect bite prevention

Many diseases are spread by bites from infected ticks and insects like mosquitoes, fleas, or flies. Before you travel, find out what types of ticks or insects are in the area, when they’re most active, and what diseases they can spread.

To protect yourself from bites:

* use an approved bug spray (insect repellent) on exposed skin
* wear light-coloured, loose clothing made of tightly woven materials like nylon or polyester
* wear socks and closed-toe shoes
* sleep under mosquito netting if you’re outdoors or staying in places that aren’t fully enclosed
* do a full body tick check on yourself, your children, your gear, and any pets you’re travelling with when you return from outdoor activities

Chikungunya

There is a risk of chikungunya in this country. The level of risk may vary by:

* season
* year
* region
* elevation

The virus that causes chikungunya is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. It can cause fever and pain in the joints. In some cases, the joint pain can be severe and last for months or years.

Protect yourself from mosquito bites at all times.

[Insect bite and pest prevention](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/insect-bite-prevention.html)

A vaccine for the prevention of chikungunya (IXCHIQ) is approved in Canada. Talk to your healthcare provider about how best to prevent chikungunya, including the benefits and risks of vaccination based on factors such as your age, itinerary and personal preferences.

Zika virus 

[Zika virus](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/zika-virus.html) is a risk in this country.

Zika virus is primarily spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. It can also be sexually transmitted. Zika virus can cause serious birth defects.

During your trip:

* [Prevent mosquito bites](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/insect-bite-prevention.html) at all times.
* Use condoms correctly or avoid sexual contact, particularly if you are pregnant.

If you are pregnant or planning a pregnancy, you should discuss the potential risks of travelling to this destination with your health care provider. You may choose to avoid or postpone travel.

For more information, see [Zika virus: Pregnant or planning a pregnancy.](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/zika-virus/pregnant-planning-pregnancy.html)

Oropouche virus disease

Oropouche virus disease (OVD) is a risk in this destination. It is a disease caused by the Oropouche virus, which is spread to humans through the bite of an infected small fly called a midge (also known as no-see-um) and possibly certain mosquitos. Symptoms usually include fever, headache, joint and muscle pain, chills, and sometimes nausea and vomiting. In some cases, aseptic meningitis (inflammation of the membranes that surround the brain) may occur.

Protect yourself from midge and mosquito bites at all times. There is no vaccine or medication that protects against OVD.

[Insect bite and pest prevention](https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.canada.ca%2Fen%2Fpublic-health%2Fservices%2Fdiseases%2Finsect-bite-prevention.html&data=05%7C02%7Cemma.wilson-pease%40phac-aspc.gc.ca%7C950eb571eea04ea8922408dd8bfc0e6b%7C42fd9015de4d4223a368baeacab48927%7C0%7C0%7C638820636858248088%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=3wrheI8AJmjXghdnmKpB6VhknzTfqTjXNWSNKNTG6Wc%3D&reserved=0)

Most travellers are at low risk. There are concerns that the Oropouche virus could be passed from a pregnant woman or pregnant person to their unborn baby, which might lead to serious problems like stillbirth or issues with the baby’s head and brain development. Pregnant women, pregnant people, or anyone planning a pregnancy should discuss the possible risks of travelling to areas with Oropouche virus with their healthcare provider. The healthcare provider may advise you to avoid nonessential travel to areas experiencing an OVD outbreak.

* To find out if your destination is experiencing an ongoing OVD outbreak, check the top of the Health section for any travel health notices or outbreak monitoring alerts.

### Animal precautions

Some infections can spread directly from animals to people, like rabies or bird flu (avian influenza). Others don’t spread directly from animals but can infect people who visit areas animals have contaminated with their droppings or body fluids.

Certain activities can increase your chances of coming into contact with animals, their droppings, or their body fluids, like:

* travelling in rural or forested areas
* camping, hiking, or visiting caves
* visiting places where live animals are sold or killed for food, like wet markets

To reduce your risk of getting sick:

* avoid contact with animals like stray dogs, livestock (such as pigs and cows), monkeys, snakes, rodents, birds, and bats.
* stay away from places where animal waste can build up, such as caves
* avoid eating undercooked meat

Make sure to closely watch children; they are more likely to try to touch animals.

### Person-to-person infections

When travelling, you can reduce your risk of getting or spreading respiratory infections, like the flu or COVID-19, by:

* staying at your accommodation and limiting contact with others if you’re sick
* wearing a well-fitting mask, especially:   
  + if you’re sick and need to be around others
  + when you’re at large indoor events or in crowded settings, like sporting events, concerts, and airports
* cleaning your hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or using hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol
* covering your coughs and sneezes with a tissue or your elbow, not your hands

[Respiratory infectious diseases: How to reduce the spread with personal protective measures](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/respiratory-infectious-diseases-reduce-spread-personal-protective-measures.html)

To lower your risk of getting sexually transmissible infections (STIs), HIV, and mpox, you can:

* get vaccinated against mpox if you’re eligible
* practise safer sex methods
  + use barrier protection during sexual activity, like condoms and dental dams.

[Mpox vaccines](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/mpox/symptoms-management.html#a4)

[HIV and AIDS: Travel health advice](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/hiv-aids/travel-health-advice.html)

Tuberculosis

[Tuberculosis](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/tuberculosis.html) is an infection caused by bacteria and usually affects the lungs.

For most travellers the risk of tuberculosis is low.

Travellers who may be at high risk while travelling in regions with risk of tuberculosis should discuss pre- and post-travel options with a health care professional.

High-risk travellers include those visiting or working in prisons, refugee camps, homeless shelters, or hospitals, or travellers visiting friends and relatives.

### Medical services and facilities

Good health care is only available in major cities. The quality of the care varies greatly across the country.

Public clinics and hospitals may be overwhelmed. Public facilities may also lack medical supplies and equipment. Not all doctors or medical staff will speak English or French.

Medical facilities may require payment up front for medical treatment.  Private hospitals and doctors may also require payment in advance. They could also request to see proof of your insurance before admitting you as a patient.

Ambulances are unreliable in most areas of the country. They are more reliable and available in major cities and tourist areas, including:

* Santo Domingo
* Santiago
* Punta Cana
* Puerto Plata

Private hospitals and clinics are better equipped than public ones. There have been cases of overcharging for medical services and unnecessary overnight hospital stays at private facilities.

You should be cautious of in-house resort doctors. Many are contracted out by private hospitals and may use aggressive sales tactics and offer services with additional or hidden costs.

If you go to the hospital during your stay:

* inquire about fees prior to undergoing treatment
* let the hospital administrators know if you feel you have been overcharged after a visit
* request assistance in English or French from the hospital’s guest services desk

Make sure you get travel insurance that includes coverage for medical evacuation and hospital stays.

### Medical tourism

Canadian citizens have had serious health complications following cosmetic or other elective surgeries abroad.

If you are considering travel to the Dominican Republic for cosmetic surgery, be aware that legal options in case of malpractice are very limited.

Before leaving for a medical travel:

* make sure you have done your research
* use reputable health-care providers only

[Receiving medical care outside Canada](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/medical-care-outside-canada)

### Keep in Mind...

The decision to travel is the sole responsibility of the traveller. The traveller is also responsible for his or her own personal safety.

Be prepared. Do not expect medical services to be the same as in Canada. Pack a [travel health kit](http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/kit), especially if you will be travelling away from major city centres.
