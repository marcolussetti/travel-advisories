You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

In accordance with Dominican law, a person detained or arrested by the authorities may be held without charges for up to 48 hours before the case is presented to a judge.

Judicial processes may last several years during which accused individuals are normally detained. It could lead to very long prison sentences in difficult conditions.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect lengthy jail sentences and heavy fines.

The Dominican Republic has a zero-tolerance policy to illegal drugs, including cannabis. Authorities can impose severe penalties for possession of even a small quantity.

#### Drug trafficking

Drug traffickers have used tourists as unwitting drug couriers.

Even unsuspecting individuals transporting illegal drugs, including cannabis, can be criminally charged and face long jail sentences.

Pack and carry only your personal belongings, and never leave them unattended.

### Identification

Local authorities may request to see your identification at any time.

* Always carry valid identification or a photocopy of it
* Keep a photocopy of your passport and your visa or entry stamp in a safe place in case it’s lost or seized

### Reporting a crime

Victims of crime, including foreigners, are responsible for reporting incidents to police in the Dominican Republic. If you are the victim of a crime, you should contact the local tourist police and the embassy of Canada to the Dominican Republic, in San Domingo. If you wish to pursue prosecution or seek compensation, you will have to hire a lawyer in the Dominican Republic to file a formal complaint to the police and to pursue the case through the justice system. The Embassy of Canada can provide a list of attorneys.

### Reporting a car accident

You must call the police and wait at the scene of an accident. The driver in any accident that causes severe injury or death will be taken into police custody until they have completed their investigation.

You should register any accident with a government accident reporting centre. English-speaking agents can help you navigate police and insurance company processes.

If you’re detained because of a road accident, you should ask the police to contact the Embassy of Canada in Santo Domingo.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and the Dominican Republic.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in the Dominican Republic, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Dominican court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in the Dominican Republic to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.
