# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Border with Haiti

Land and sea borders with Haiti are closed to travellers. The Embassy of Canada in Santo Domingo cannot help you enter the Dominican Republic from Haiti.

The security environment is highly unpredictable in the border areas between Haiti and the Dominican Republic, particularly in Dajabón. Disturbances and incidents are common, some of which can lead to violence. Emergency services are often unavailable near the border.

If you choose to travel near the border with Haiti:

* keep your passport on-hand and accessible
* avoid travelling after dark
* monitor local media to stay informed of the current situation
* follow the instructions of local authorities and security forces

### Crime

Crime, including violent crime, occurs across the country, especially in major cities.

The police are often unable to respond in a timely manner quickly to calls for assistance, especially outside of resort and tourist areas.

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, including pickpocketing and bag-snatching, occurs frequently. Tourists are common targets for theft.

Crime of opportunity is common. Thieves may try to snatch visible money, valuables, or grab your phone from your hands. Crime tends to rise during holiday periods.

Incidents occur:

* at resorts and hotels, including inside private rooms and room safes
* from inside cars, especially rental cars
* at beaches
* at airports
* at bus stations
* on public transportation

Drive-by robberies are common. Thieves on motorcycles, scooters or bicycles snatch bags and other valuables from pedestrians. Thieves may even reach into vehicles, including taxis, stopped at red lights to steal belongings.

At airports, thieves may target checked baggage in departures areas.

* Stay at hotels or resorts with good security
* Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Carry only small amounts of money and avoid showing signs of affluence
* Keep electronic devices like cellphones, tablets, laptops and cameras out of sight
* Keep car doors locked, windows up and your belongings out of sight
* Don’t pack valuables in your checked luggage

#### Violent crime

Violent crime occurs, occasionally targeting foreigners. Incidents take place mainly after nightfall in large cities.

Incidents include:

* armed robberies
* assaults
* burglaries

Criminals target cars for armed robberies on the roads, especially after nightfall. You should arrange to arrive and depart from the Dominican Republic during daylight hours.

During your stay:

* stay at reputable hotels or resorts with adequate security
* be aware of your surroundings at all times
* keep your car doors locked and windows up, especially at a traffic light
* avoid walking alone in unpopulated areas and unpatrolled beaches after dark
* if you’re threatened, hand over your valuables and do not resist an attack

#### Sexual assault

Incidents of sexual assault and rape have occurred, including at major resorts and hotels. Employees of resorts and hotels have been involved.

If you are a victim of a sexual assault or other crime, you should report it immediately to the nearest office of the Government of Canada. You should also file a report with Dominican authorities. Criminal investigations will not move forward unless you file a formal complaint to local authorities before you leave the country.

* Avoid secluded areas, even on resorts and hotel grounds
* Exercise caution when dealing with strangers or recent acquaintances
* Be wary of strangers offering rides or other invitations
* Avoid taking public transportation or walking alone at night

### Fraud

#### Credit, debit and ATM card fraud

Credit and debit card as well as ATM fraud occur frequently. Card reader tampering, also known as skimming, is a common scam. Businesses could try to save your credit or debit card information when you make a legitimate purchase through a compromised card reader. Be cautious when using debit or credit cards.

* Cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* Pay careful attention when others are handling your cards
* Avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* Use ATMs located in public areas or inside a bank or business
* Check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

#### Unethical lawyers

Unethical lawyers, known locally as “pirate lawyers” operate in tourist areas, particularly in Punta Cana. They wait near tourist police stations and offer legal services to detained foreigners, for which they charge excessive fees to resolve the cases.

The Embassy of Canada, in Santo Domingo, can provide you with a list of available lawyers.

#### Cybercrime

Cybercrime, malware attacks and online extortion occur.

Criminals can compromise public Wi-Fi networks to steal personal data or credit card information. They can also monitor social media and listen to your phone conversations.

Romance scams through dating sites and/or social media have occurred.

* Be cautious when posting information or photos on social media
* Use your own USB adaptor or carry an extra battery pack
* Use secure public Wi-Fi networks
* Beware of people who show a keen interest in you online
* Keep in mind that you may be the victim of a scam if you go to the Dominican Republic to meet an online acquaintance in person
* Do not discuss travel plans or any other personal information within earshot of strangers

### Demonstrations and strikes

Demonstrations take place from time to time throughout the country, particularly in Santo Domingo. They do not often affect resort areas.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Adventure tourism

Outdoor activities, such as kayaking, scuba diving, snorkelling, and extreme sports can be dangerous.

The tourism industry is not well regulated. Tour operators may not meet Canadian safety standards, and many industry workers may have little or no training or certifications. Local authorities may not routinely inspect facilities and equipment. Many destinations have hazards that are unidentified or poorly indicated.

If you intend to participate in adventure tourism activities:

* buy travel insurance that covers incidents related to this type of recreational activity
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to tackle the challenges of your activity
* ensure that you have proper equipment and bring sufficient water
* monitor weather conditions and other possible hazards
* avoid using equipment if you are unsure of its condition or safety

### Water activities

#### Swimming

Coastal waters can be dangerous. Follow the instructions and warnings of local authorities.

Lifeguard and rescue services don’t always meet Canadian standards. Many beaches have limited or no lifeguards on duty. Several drownings occur every year.

* Respect the areas reserved for swimming
* Always maintain a safe distance from boats and restricted areas
* Always respect warning flags advising of dangerous conditions
* Consult residents and tour operators for information on possible hazards, the presence of dangerous species and safe swimming areas
* Do not dive in unfamiliar waters as hidden rocks or shallow water can cause serious injury or death
* Follow the instructions of local authorities

#### Riptides

Tidal changes and strong winds can cause dangerous riptides.

### Roads

#### Road safety

Road safety may vary considerably across the country. Accidents occur frequently. You should consider hiring a licensed professional driver if you plan on travelling by road.

Pedestrians don’t have the right of way, even at traffic lights. Be aware of your surroundings and stay alert when crossing the street, particularly in Santo Domingo. Local authorities treat serious car accidents as criminal investigations. If you are involved in a car accident, you must report it to the police.

If you are issued a ticket by the police, you do not need to pay it on the spot. You can pay fines on the website of the Office of the Attorney General.

#### Road conditions

Road conditions and road safety can vary greatly throughout the country. Major highways connecting cities and tourist areas are generally in good condition, but they are not well maintained in rural areas. Many roads do not have marked lanes.

Driving can also be dangerous due to:

* unmarked speed bumps
* potholes
* animals and livestock on the roads
* insufficient lighting
* traffic jams and heavy traffic, especially on weekends and statutory holidays
* vehicles travelling in the wrong direction

#### Driving habits

Drivers don’t always respect traffic laws. They often speed and can be aggressive and reckless. Drinking and driving is common.

Heavy traffic, drinking and driving, and accidents are more common during busy holiday periods including Christmas and Easter.

If you choose to drive during your stay:

* always drive defensively
* plan your trip in advance, especially if you plan to visit a rural area
* travel in groups during daylight hours
* carry a cell phone and a charger
* fill your gas tank before you travel, especially if you are travelling to a remote area
* keep your car doors locked and the windows closed at all times

### Roadblocks

Military and police roadblocks are common, especially near the Haitian border. You should be prepared to show identification.

### Public transportation

#### Buses

Public buses are unreliable. You should only use private intercity buses from reputable tour operators. Avoid using open-door microbuses, known as “gua-guas” or “carros publicos.” These services are often unregulated and poorly maintained.

#### Ride-share services

Ride-share services are available in major cities and most popular tourist destinations.

If you use a ride-sharing app:

* confirm the driver’s identity and license plate before getting in the car
* use the security features in rideshare apps

#### Taxis

Taxis are not metered. You should arrange your pickup with your hotel before arrival when travelling by air. At the airport, only use taxis from the official stands. If you are uncertain whether a taxi is official, ask for assistance at an airport information desk.

During your stay:

* only use reputable taxi companies through establishments such as hotels or ride-sharing services
* never share a taxi with strangers
* avoid using or renting motorcycle taxis known as “motoconchos”
* negotiate the fare prior to departure
