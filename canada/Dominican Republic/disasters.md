### Earthquakes and tsunamis

The Dominican Republic is located in an active seismic zone. Tremors occur frequently.

A tsunami can occur within minutes of a nearby earthquake. However, the risk of tsunami can remain for several hours following the first tremor. If you’re staying on the coast, familiarize yourself with the region’s evacuation plans in the event of a tsunami warning.
