# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the authorities of the Dominican Republic. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Until November 30, 2025, Canadians can enter the Dominican Republic for tourism purposes with a passport valid for their entire stay.

If you are travelling for other purposes, you are required to have a passport valid for a minimum of six months after the date of arrival in the Dominican Republic.

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for a minimum of 6 months after the date of your arrival in the Dominican Republic.

#### Passport for official travel

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### E-Ticket

You must complete an electronic form, or E-ticket, to enter and exit the country. You will need a new E-ticket every time you travel to the Dominican Republic.

If you enter the Dominican Republic by air, the cost of the tourist card is included in your airline ticket.  If you enter the Dominican Republic by sea, you can obtain the card from the General Directorate of Internal Taxes at your point of entry.

#### Extension and overstay

You can apply for a stay extension for a period of up to 120 days. You must request to extend your stay at the Dominican Directorate General for Migration, in Santo Domingo, after you arrive in the Dominican Republic and before your tourist card expires.

If you overstay the duration of your tourist card or your extension, you could be deported or refused re-entry.
