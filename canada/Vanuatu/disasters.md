### Volcanoes

There are several active or potentially active volcanoes in Vanuatu. In the event of an eruption, volcanic ash clouds could significantly disrupt air traffic in the region. The Vanuatu Meteorology & Geo-Hazards Department lists active volcanoes and associated alert levels. If you are travelling near a volcano, check for the latest activity and alerts and always follow the instructions of local authorities.

### Rainy season

The rainy (monsoon) season occurs from November to April.

Severe storms can put you at risk and can hamper the provision of essential services. During a cyclone or monsoon, hotel guests may be required to leave accommodations near the shore and move to safety centres inland. Travel to and from outer islands may be disrupted for some days.

If you decide to travel to Vanuatu during this time:

* know that you expose yourself to serious safety risks
* be prepared to change your travel plans on short notice, including cutting short or cancelling your trip
* stay informed of the latest regional weather forecasts
* carry emergency contact information for your airline or tour operator
* follow the advice and instructions of local authorities
