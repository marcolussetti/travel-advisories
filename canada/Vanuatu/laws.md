## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect jail sentences and heavy fines.

#### Alcohol

The sale of alcohol is prohibited between Saturday and Monday or during elections. Exceptions apply to hotels and restaurants.

### Dress and behaviour

Always ask permission before photographing locals.

To avoid offending local sensitivities:

* dress conservatively
* behave discreetly
* respect religious and social traditions
* donâ€™t wear beach attire outside of beaches or resorts

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Vanuatu law does not prohibit sexual acts between individuals of the same sex. However, homosexuality is not widely accepted in Vanuatu society.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Vanuatu.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of Vanuatu, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Vanuatu.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Vanuatu by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Vanuatu to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Money

You may use Australian dollars at some shops, restaurants and hotels in Port-Vila. Major credit cards are generally accepted in Port-Vila and Luganville, but less so elsewhere in Vanuatu. ATMs are available at the ANZ and Westpac banks.
