# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Crime

Violent crime in Vanuatu is rare, but petty crime occurs. Ensure that your personal belongings, including passports and other travel documents are secure at all times.

Home break-ins occur, even when the occupants are present. Lock your doors and windows at night and when you are not home.

Criminal activity generally increases in the weeks leading up to holidays.

Exercise caution when attending bars and clubs in Port-Vila as tourists have been the target of attacks.

### Women’s safety

Women may be subject to sexual harassment or sexual assault, more so if travelling alone at night. Women should avoid travelling alone, particularly on public transportation and in isolated locations and beaches.

### Fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud occurs. Be cautious when using debit or credit cards:

* pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others
* use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

### Demonstrations

Public disturbances occur occasionally and demonstrations are rare. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Tourist facilities

Tourist facilities and services are good but limited outside Port-Vila.

Plan ahead to minimize safety risks.

### Water activities

Sharks are present in the waters off Vanuatu, particularly around the islands of Espiritu Santo and Malekula. Seek advice from local authorities before swimming.

Some beaches are located on private property and may not be clearly identified. Do your research to make sure you are not trespassing on private property.

### Adventure activities

Safety standards for adventure activities, such as diving, may not be up to international standards. If engaging in adventure activities:

* never do so alone and always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* ensure that you are properly equipped and well informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary, including when you expect to be back to camp
* ensure the company, operator or guide you are using is properly certified
* inspect equipment to make sure it is in proper working condition and use all available safety equipment

### Public transportation

Boat services between Vanuatu’s islands may not be safe. The boats may not be suitable for inter-island travel or may not have required trained personnel or safety equipment for safe passage.

Taxis may be hailed on the street and are metered. Minibuses are also available, but are often in poor condition.

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety vary throughout Vanuatu. The islands of Efate and Santo have paved roads. Roads in all other areas are unpaved or dirt tracks.

Driving conditions may be hazardous due to poor lighting and pedestrians walking on the roads.

### Air travel

We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.
