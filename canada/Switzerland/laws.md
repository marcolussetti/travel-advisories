## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Transfer to a Canadian prison

Canada and Switzerland are signatories to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in Switzerland to request a transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both Canadian and Switzerland authorities.

This process can take a long time, and there is no guarantee that the transfer will be approved by either or both sides.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect jail sentences or heavy fines.

### Concealing your face in public places

It is illegal to cover your face in public places. This ban is already in force in several cantons and is expected to be implemented nationwide in 2022.

There is no exemption for tourists or for religious reasons.

Offenders risk a fine.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Switzerland.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Switzerland, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### Compulsory military service

Swiss male citizens must perform military service, or alternative civilian service.

A man with dual Canadian and Swiss citizenship or who is eligible for Swiss citizenship may also be required to do so.

In peacetime, the Swiss authorities do not generally call up their nationals living abroad for compulsory military service as long as they remain abroad.

Consult a Swiss embassy or consulate before your trip.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Switzerland.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Switzerland, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Swiss court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Switzerland to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Driving

You must be at least 18 years old to drive in Switzerland.

You can drive with your Canadian licence for up to 12 months. If you stay in Switzerland, you will have to exchange your Canadian licence for a Swiss licence.

To drive on the motorways, you must obtain a vignette and affix it to the windshield of your vehicle.

Valid for one year, this vignette can be purchased:

* at most border crossings
* at tourist offices
* at petrol stations
* at post offices
* online at the Swiss Post website

Drivers who do not display the vignette are liable to heavy fines levied on the spot.

All vehicles must be equipped with a safety kit and a warning triangle for use in the event of a breakdown.

In winter, winter tires are mandatory and snow chains may be required in some mountainous areas.
