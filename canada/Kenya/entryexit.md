# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from Kenyan authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least six months from the date of entry into Kenya.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

As of January 1, 2024, tourists are required to apply and pay for an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) prior to their travel. You can still use issued valid tourist visas until they expire.

You must obtain your visa or eTA online prior to your departure. Be sure to check the visa validity immediately after issuance.

If you don’t have a valid visa, you could be detained, taken to court and charged for being in Kenya illegally. You could be subject to a fine or deportation.

#### Visa extension

Kenyan Immigration authorities may extend your visa for one month at a time, for a maximum of three months. Each extension costs KSH 1000, and must be requested while the visa is still valid.

To extend your visa, contact immigration authorities once you are in the country.

### Fees

You must pay all visa fees in exact cash and only in U.S. dollars, British pound sterling or euros. You can’t pay for a visa with a credit card.

There is no fee for visas for children under 16 years.

### East African tourist visa

The East African Tourist Visa allows for multiple entries to Kenya, Uganda, and Rwanda.

This visa is valid for 90 days and cannot be extended.

You must obtain this visa from the authorities of the country that is your first entry point. If you plan to begin your trip in Kenya, you must obtain it from the High Commission for the Republic of Kenya or on arrival.

### Work Permits

You must have a valid work permit to work or volunteer in Kenya. It is illegal to work or volunteer in Kenya with any other type of visa.

As a foreign worker in Kenya, you must carry the necessary work permits and documentation with you at all times, even when volunteering. Strict actions will be taken if you don’t comply, including deportation.

To obtain an electronic working permit, apply online with the Department of Immigration Services. You must visit the Kenya Immigration headquarters (Nyayo House in the Central Business District of Nairobi) after completing the online application to obtain your permit.

### NGO workers

Canadians planning to work or volunteer (including, temporarily or part-time) in Kenya for any period are required to have a work permit.

The National Council of NGOs can provide assistance in obtaining a work permit for individuals planning to work for a local NGO if contacted in advance.

If an employee moves from one organization to another, the first permit becomes void and the individual must apply for a new permit to work with the subsequent organization.

Consult with the NGO with whom you are planning to volunteer, as well as with the Kenya Immigration Foreign Nationals Services for full information and requirements.
