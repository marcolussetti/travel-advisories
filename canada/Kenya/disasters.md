## Natural disasters and climate

### Rainy seasons and droughts

Drought is the most prevalent natural hazard in Kenya affecting mainly the eastern, north eastern and coast area, as well as parts of the Rift Valley.

There are normally two rainy seasons in Kenya: from October to November, and from late March to mid-June. Seasonal flooding and mudslides can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable and bridges damaged.

If you reside in or are travelling to affected areas:

* exercise caution
* monitor local news and weather reports
* follow the advice of local authorities

### Volcanoes and earthquakes

Natural disasters are possible due to regional volcanic and seismic activity. While there have not been any recent incidents, pay careful attention to all warnings issued.
