## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Identification

You must carry photo identification or a copy of your passport at all times. Police and immigration officials have the right to demand proof of your identification, residency or valid visas. You should cooperate with authorities if you are asked for identification. Failure to present proof of residence or a valid visa to authorities when requested to do so could result in fines or arrest. Keep a photocopy of your passport in a safe place, in case it's lost or confiscated.

### Volunteering

It is illegal to work or volunteer in Kenya without a valid work permit. Kenyan authorities strictly enforce this law. Convicted offenders could face heavy fines, jail sentences of up to five years and deportation.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect jail sentences ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment and heavy fines. You could also face fines and jail time if you are convicted of being in a location where there are illegal drugs, even if they are not yours.

#### Alcohol

There are strict restrictions on the sale of alcoholic beverages and on consuming alcohol in public places.

### Photography

Photography of government buildings, foreign embassies and missions (including the Canadian High Commission), airports, military facilities or other sensitive locations is prohibited and may lead to arrest or detention.

#### Firearms

To carry firearms, you must obtain permission from local authorities prior to entering the country. Firearms are strictly forbidden in wildlife reserves and national parks.

#### Pornographic material

Possession of pornographic material is forbidden.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Kenyan law prohibits sexual acts between individuals of the same sex. Those convicted can face lengthy prison sentences.

Even though there are few convictions, 2SLGBTQI+ persons are routinely harassed by the police, and societal discrimination based on sexual orientation is widespread.

2SLGBTQI+ persons should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Kenya.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Kenya.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Kenya, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Kenya.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Kenya by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Kenya to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Driving

Traffic drives on the left.

While driving, drivers must always carry:

* a valid driver's licence
* vehicle registration documents
* proof of valid insurance
* a valid vehicle inspection certificate

These documents must be produced on demand by a police officer.

You must be at least 18 years old to drive a private motor vehicle in Kenya.

You may drive using a Canadian driver's licence for up to 90 days from the date of entry into Kenya.

An International Driving Permit is accepted, if presented with your original Canadian licence.

Residents of Kenya may apply for a Kenyan driver's licence with proof of a valid Canadian driver's licence.

If using a Canadian licence for any of the above cases, it must be in English or a certified translation must accompany it and be presented on demand.

Private motor vehicles must have 2 emergency triangles.

If you are stopped due to a traffic violation, the police officer may ask you to pay an on-the spot fine. Police, however, are not permitted to accept cash on the spot without issuing an official receipt. If you disagree with the traffic ticket, you have the right to ask for due process. The officer should provide you with information on when and where you can go to be properly charged, and then you may pursue that process.

### Culture

Exercise common sense and discretion in your dress and behaviour, particularly in the coast region, where the majority of the population is Muslim.

To avoid offending local sensitivities:

* dress conservatively
* behave discreetly
* respect religious and social traditions

### Ramadan

In 2026, the lunar month of Ramadan is expected to begin on or around February 17.

In public, between sunrise and sunset, be discreet when:

* drinking
* eating
* smoking

### Money

The currency is the Kenyan shilling (KES).

ATMs are widely available.

Credit cards are widely accepted at major hotels, but not always in more remote locations.

Many banks and hotels exchange foreign currency. It is also possible to convert Kenyan shillings into foreign currency at the airport upon departure.

M-PESA is a common form of electronic funds transfer accepted across Kenya, including at national parks. National parks do not accept cash and generally accept credit cards, but at times, due to technical difficulties, only payment via M-PESA is accepted.

Travellers who import the equivalent of U.S. $5,000 or more must provide documentation stating the source and purpose of the funds.
