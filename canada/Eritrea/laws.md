### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Eritrea.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of Eritrea, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

### Mandatory military service

All Eritrean citizens between the ages of 18 and 40 are subject to mandatory military service and could be called for military mobilization.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Eritrea.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Eritrea by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Eritrea to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Money

The currency of Eritrea is the nakfa (ERN).

On arrival, travellers must declare all foreign currency they are importing in excess of US$10,000 or the equivalent in other foreign currencies.

Eritrea has a cash-based economy. Credit cards are not accepted as a method of payment for everyday transactions. It is illegal to use foreign currency to make purchases, except for official hotels, where foreigners are expected to pay for accommodations in euros or U.S. dollars.

Foreign currency must be exchanged at a branch of the “Himbol”, the official state foreign currency exchange, at main banks or in major hotels in Asmara.

You can’t take more than 1000 nafka out of the country. Offenders could have their money confiscated and/or face prosecution.
