### Local culture

### Ramadan

In 2026, the lunar month of Ramadan is expected to begin on or around February 17.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Eritrea.

If local authorities consider you an Eritrean citizen, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services, thereby preventing Canadian consular officials from providing you with those services.

Dual citizens returning to Eritrea may have to do compulsory military service.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Eritrea.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Eritrea by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Eritrea to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Money

The currency is the nakfa (ERN).

On arrival, travellers must declare, in writing, all foreign currency they are importing in excess of US$10,000 or the equivalent in other foreign currencies.

Credit cards are not accepted as a method of payment for everyday transactions. They are made in cash, using the nakfa. However, the Government of Eritrea expects foreign tourists to pay for accommodations in foreign currency.

Foreign currency must be exchanged at a branch of the Himbol Exchange at the official exchange rate.

You can’t take more than 500 nakfa out of the country. Offenders can have their money confiscated or face prosecution.
