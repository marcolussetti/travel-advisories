# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Military Operations in Tigray

The Eritrean military called for a mobilization of armed forces on September 15, 2022.

A cessation of hostilities agreement was signed on November 2, 2022 between the Government of Ethiopia and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF). The agreement has yet to be fully implemented and there remains uncertainty regarding its implications for security along the Eritrean borders with Ethiopia and the Sudan.

Additional security measures could be imposed in Eritrea on short notice.

If you are in Eritrea:

* limit your movements
* ensure that your travel documents are up-to-date
* monitor local media to stay informed on the evolving situation

### Border between Eritrea and Djibouti

Political tension and territorial conflicts continue to cause instability in the area by the Eritrean–Djiboutian border. Border raids could be carried out and can result in armed confrontations and other violent incidents. Crime is also of concern in this area.

### Border between Eritrea and Ethiopia

Armed conflicts involving Eritrean forces have been taking place in the Tigray region of Ethiopia since early November 2020. In late 2020, several explosions were reported in Asmara. Although the situation in Ethiopia has somewhat stabilized, the conflict continues in the Tigray region and the situation near the border remains volatile.

All border crossings between Ethiopia and Eritrea are currently closed. There are also unmarked landmines in the border area. You should avoid all travel within 50km of the border with Ethiopia.

If you must travel in this region despite this advisory:

* stay on the main paved roads
* do not walk in the countryside

### Border between Eritrea and Sudan

The presence of rebel groups in the area next to Eritrea’s border with Sudan poses a risk. Crime and bomb attacks occur. The border remains closed: do not attempt to cross it.

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism. Terrorist attacks could occur at any time. Terrorist targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

Stay at hotels that have robust security measures; however, keep in mind that even the most secure locations cannot be considered completely free of risk.

### Crime

Street crime is infrequent in Asmara and in other towns and villages. However, petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs and is targeted towards foreigners. Crime is more common in border areas.

* Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Avoid showing signs of affluence

Banditry occurs along the coast north of Massawa.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations may occur. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Shortages

Due to the closure of many of Eritrea’s water purification and bottling plants, there is a generalized drinking water supply problem.

* Plan to have adequate water supplies
* Ensure that your emergency kit is complete

### Landmines

Landmines continue to cause occasional injury and death. Many areas are mined. Exercise caution in remote areas or off main roads. Avoid walking and hiking in the countryside.

### Telecommunications

Landline telephone, cell phone and Internet networks are unreliable and often limited to a few hours of service a day in major cities.

### Road safety

Paved roads connect the major cities of Asmara, Barentu, Dekemhare, Keren, Massawa and Mendefera, but roads to small villages are unpaved.

Driving can be dangerous due to:

* lack of road signs;
* lack of safety guard rails;
* the presence of animals, numerous pedestrians and cyclists on the road.

Avoid travelling in rural areas after nightfall./p>

### Public transportation

Public transportation, especially buses, is often overcrowded. Many taxis are available, but they often take several passengers and follow predetermined itineraries. If you pay a higher fare, you may ask a driver in advance not to take other passengers.

### Piracy

Pirate attacks and armed robbery against ships occur in coastal waters and, in some cases, farther out at sea. Mariners should take appropriate precautions.
