# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Military operations in Tigray

A cessation of hostilities agreement was signed on November 2, 2022, between the Government of Ethiopia and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF). The security situation along the Eritrean borders with Ethiopia and Sudan remains uncertain despite this agreement.

Local authorities could impose additional security measures on short notice.

If you are in Eritrea:

* limit your movements
* ensure that your travel documents are up to date
* monitor local media to stay informed of the evolving situation

### Border between Eritrea and Djibouti

Political tension and territorial conflicts continue to cause instability in the Eritrean-Djiboutian border area. Armed confrontations, violent incidents and military activities could occur.

### Border between Eritrea and Ethiopia

The border with Ethiopia is still heavily militarized despite the peace agreement signed in 2018. Although the situation has stabilized in Ethiopia’s Tigray region, the situation near the border remains volatile and armed conflict could erupt without notice.

All border crossings between Ethiopia and Eritrea are currently closed. There are also unmarked landmines in the border areas.

### Border between Eritrea and Sudan

The security situation in the area between Eritrea and Sudan is volatile due to the presence of armed groups operating along the border, the risk of terrorist attacks and criminal activity.

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism.

Terrorists may target public places and crowded areas.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including police stations
* schools, including universities
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners
* cultural venues

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

### Crime

Street crime is infrequent in Asmara and in other towns and villages. However, petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occasionally occurs and mostly targets tourists. The risk increases after dark.

During your trip:

* keep your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, in a secure place
* do not show signs of affluence or wear expensive jewellery
* do not carry large sums of cash or valuables unnecessarily

Crime and banditry are more common in border areas and along the coast north of Massawa.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations may occur. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Landmines

Landmines and unexploded ordnance still pose a serious risk in several regions.

If you’re travelling outside of cities:

* be especially vigilant in remote areas
* stay on paved
* stay on main roads
* cross only at official border crossings
* avoid walking in fields and rural areas
* pay attention to signs indicating the possible presence of landmines

### Women’s safety

Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

2SLGBTQI+ persons could be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression or sex characteristics and could be victims of harassments and verbal or physical violence. Avoid public displays of affection.

Eritrean law criminalizes sexual acts and relationships between persons of the same sex.

Convicted offenders could face up to 7 years of imprisonment and heavy fines.

2SLGBTQI+ persons should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Eritrea.

### Power outages

Power outages occur regularly in the entire country, including in Asmara. Power outages often impact essential service, such as:

* public lighting and traffic lights
* the public water supply
* telecommunications

Not all buildings are equipped with generators.

### Telecommunications

Landline telephone, cell phone and Internet networks are unreliable. Local SIM cards cannot be purchased without a residence permit. Data service and roaming are not available. Local authorities control telecommunications. They may cut off access to cell phone and Internet systems during periods of civil unrest.

### Roads

#### Road safety

There are major safety issues in Eritrea. The number of fatal road accidents is high and often involve pedestrians. Police and emergency services assistance is limited, particularly in rural areas.

#### Road conditions

Roads are usually in good condition in Asmara, but can be steep, curving and narrow in the hilly part of the city. Paved roads connect the major cities of Asmara, Barentu, Dekemhare, Keren, Massawa and Mendefera. Secondary roads are unpaved.

Driving can be dangerous due to:

* insufficient lighting
* potholes
* unpaved roads
* poorly maintained vehicles
* lack of traffic signs
* lack of guardrails
* fog at certain moments of the year
* the presence of animals, pedestrians and cyclists on the road

#### Driving habits

Drivers often disregard traffic laws and speeding is common. Pedestrians and other drivers’ rights of way are not respected. Drinking and driving is common.

If you choose to drive in Eritrea:

* always drive defensively
* avoid travelling after dark
* use only main roads and highways
* fill your gas tank before you travel, especially if you are travelling to a remote area
* always carry a cell phone, a charger and an extra battery pack

#### Checkpoints

Checkpoints are common throughout the country. The police and military have the authority to establish security checkpoints and travel permit checks. Foreign nationals require a government-issued travel permit to travel between regions.

* Always carry identification
* If you are travelling outside Asmara, have your mandatory travel permits with you
* Follow the instructions of local authorities

### Public transportation

#### Buses

Buses are unsafe, overcrowded and frequently involved in accidents. Theft can occur, especially during peak hours.

Even with the necessary permits, foreign nationals have been prevented by local authorities from travelling outside Asmara’s surrounding province.

#### Taxis

Taxis are available in Asmara.

* Only use official taxis, recognizable by their yellow colour
* Never share a cab with strangers
* Make sure the driver does not pick up other passengers on the way to your destination
* Confirm the fare in advance
* Have small bills available for payment

### Piracy

Pirate attacks and armed robberies against ships occur in coastal waters and, in some cases, farther out at sea. Travellers should take appropriate precautions.
