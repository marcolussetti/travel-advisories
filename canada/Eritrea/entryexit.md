# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Eritrean authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you use for travel.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond the date you expect to leave Eritrea.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Visas

Tourist visa: required  
Business visa: required  
Official visa: required  
In-transit visa: required

All visas must be obtained prior to travel. Obtaining a visa can take a very long time. Apply well in advance of your planned departure.

### Dual citizenship

You should always travel using your valid Canadian passport and present yourself as Canadian to foreign authorities at all times. Note, however, that dual citizens must have an Eritrean national ID card, or at least have applied for one, before they can obtain an Eritrean visa in their Canadian passport. Dual citizens who enter Eritrea must obtain an exit visa before leaving the country. Exit visa applications may be denied or cause delays in planning a trip, even for people who have entered Eritrea legally.

### Departure tax

A departure tax must be paid at the airport in nakfas or in U.S. dollars.

### Travel permit outside Asmara

All foreign nationals, including employees of non-governmental organizations and of the United Nations, must obtain a travel permit from the Government of Eritrea for all travel outside Asmara. Foreign nationals living or working outside Asmara must also obtain a travel permit to travel outside the area where they live or work. Travel regulations are strictly enforced throughout Eritrea, and there are numerous military checkpoints. The Department of Tourism, in Asmara, processes applications for travel permits. If you obtain permission to travel outside Asmara and you experience problems, Canadian officials could be limited in their capacity to provide consular assistance. The restrictions on travel outside of Asmara also apply to diplomats.
