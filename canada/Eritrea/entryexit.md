# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Eritrean authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you use for travel.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond the date you expect to leave Eritrea.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Visas

Tourist visa: required  
Business visa: required  
Official visa: required  
In-transit visa: required

All visas must be obtained prior to travel. Processing times can be long. Apply well in advance of your planned departure date.

#### Exit visa

Dual citizens who entered Eritrea with an Eritrean national identification card or an Eritrean passport must obtain an exit visa from the Immigration Office in Asmara before leaving the country. Exit visas may be denied or cause significant delays in travel plans, even for people who have entered Eritrea legally.

### Permit for travel outside Asmara

All foreign nationals, including diplomats, employees of non-governmental organizations and employees of the United Nations, must obtain a permit for all travel beyond 25 km outside Asmara. Travel regulations are strictly enforced throughout Eritrea and there are numerous military checkpoints. Applications for permits are processed by the relevant ministry:

* Ministry of Tourism for tourists
* Ministry of Trade and Industry for business travellers
* Ministry of Foreign Affairs for diplomats and non-governmental organization employees

Foreign nationals living or working outside Asmara must also obtain a travel permit from the local regional administration office, known locally as “zoba”, to travel outside the area in which they live or work.

If you obtain permission to travel outside Asmara and you experience problems, Canadian officials could be limited in their capacity to provide consular assistance.

### Land border crossings

Eritrea’s land border crossings with Ethiopia and Djibouti are closed.
