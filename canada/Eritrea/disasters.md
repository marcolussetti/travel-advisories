## Natural disasters and climate

### Climate change

Climate change is affecting Eritrea. Extreme and unusual weather events are becoming more frequent and may affect your travel plans. Monitor local media for the latest information.

### Rainy season

The rainy season extends from June to September. During this period, most regions of Eritrea are accessible except for the western lowlands, where unpaved roads turn muddy and become impassable. Seasonal flooding can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable due to mudslides and landslides. Infrastructure may be damaged.

* Monitor local media for the latest information, including on road conditions
* Stay away from flooded areas
* Monitor weather reports
* Follow instructions from local authorities, including evacuation orders

### Earthquakes and volcanoes

Eritrea is located in an active seismic and volcanic zone.

Although strong earthquakes arenâ€™t frequent, the tectonic activity in the region still poses a risk, especially along the East African Rift.

Nabro and Dubbi are the two active volcanoes in Eritrea.

Eruptions may occur at any time. Series of tremors sometimes lead to evacuations of surrounding areas. Falling ash may also disrupt air traffic.

In the event of a volcanic eruption:

* monitor local media for the latest information
* follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders
