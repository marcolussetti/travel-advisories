# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Political situation

On February 1, 2021, the Myanmar military detained officials from the elected government and declared a state of emergency, effectively seizing control of the country's governance by force. Since 2021, the political and security situation has worsened, and the armed conflict continues to escalate.

Control over territory is fragmented throughout the country. The regime’s military forces, various armed ethnic organizations, the People's Defence Forces and other groups fight to maintain or gain control of areas.

### Armed clashes

Since October 2023, there has been an escalation in the conflict between military forces and armed groups across Myanmar. There has been an increase in the number of attacks and indiscriminate regime airstrikes, resulting in civilian casualties. There have been reports of increased drones strikes, human rights violations and abuses, mass arson, and torture. The security situation is highly volatile and additional violent attacks could occur at any time across the country.

The conflict has resulted in:

* significant internal displacement
* disrupted access to supplies, cash and goods
* border crossing closures
* a high number of casualties

If you are in Myanmar despite the advisory:

* exercise caution and be aware of your surroundings
* expect a heightened presence of security forces
* expect increased travel disruptions and roadblocks
* use your judgement to decide the best time and the safest means of exit if you need to move to a safer location
* monitor international media to stay informed about the latest developments and decrees

Disruptions to supply chains and the closing of border crossings in Myanmar may result in shortages of necessities including medications.

* Plan to have adequate water and food supplies for at least 7 days
* Keep cash on hand
* Charge your mobile phone in case of internet, communication and power outages, and have portable power chargers for mobile phones

### Civil unrest

Civil unrest and acts of politically-motivated violence may occur anywhere and at any time, particularly leading up to and during days or events of national significance. Improvised explosive devices and drones have been used throughout the country, including in major cities such as Yangon, Mandalay, and Nay Pyi Taw. Further attacks targeting public venues frequented by foreigners, such as shopping malls, markets, hotels, bars and restaurants are possible.

### Arbitrary enforcement of local laws

Myanmar's military regime arbitrarily enforces local laws and may carry out random and arbitrary detentions without due process. While in Myanmar, you are at risk of arbitrary detention.

If you travel to or remain in Myanmar despite these risks:

* maintain a low profile when going outside
* be aware of local laws
* avoid concentrations of police and security forces
* comply with the regulations and guidelines from local authorities

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations take place regularly across the country, particularly in Yangon and Mandalay, and have the potential to suddenly turn violent. Security forces have been using excessive and lethal force against protesters in several locations. This has resulted in multiple casualties.

* Avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings
* Follow the advice of local authorities
* Monitor local media

### Border areas with Thailand, China, Laos, Bangladesh and India

Clashes between the military and armed groups are ongoing in several border regions.

If you travel to border areas despite this advisory:

* exercise extreme caution
* avoid concentrations of police and security forces as well as large gatherings
* follow the instructions of local authorities
* ensure you have adequate supplies to shelter in place for 7 days

### Landmines

Unmarked landmines, particularly in border areas, can be found across the country and pose a significant risk to your safety.

If you are travelling in Myanmar:

* use only major roads and transportation networks
* don't walk in fields, rural areas, roadside ditches, or unmarked trails

### Inter-communal violence

Inter-communal violence occurs and has led to many casualties. Tensions remain high, and further violence is possible. Curfews and restrictions may be imposed or changed on short notice.

Be vigilant and follow the instructions of local authorities.

### Travel restrictions

Travel within Myanmar, including to and from land border crossings, is strictly controlled by the Government of Myanmar. Embassy of Canada officials require permission from the Myanmar government to travel freely outside of Yangon to deliver consular assistance, including in an emergency.

### Security forces

The presence of police and security forces is likely to increase in Yangon and elsewhere in Myanmar on significant dates, including the anniversary of demonstrations led by monks to protest for political reform (September 26) and the anniversary of the 1988 uprising (August 8).

* Stay away from such demonstrations
* Monitor local news

### Crime

#### Violent crime

There have been incidents of violent crime against foreigners including muggings.

Exercise a high level of personal security awareness.

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, has increased. Ensure that your personal belongings, passports and other travel documents are always secure.

#### Organized crime

Transnational criminal networks linked to drug and human trafficking, as well as cyber-fraud, operate across Myanmar, especially in border regions. If you travel near these areas, there is a high risk of detention, extortion and violence. Local authorities have limited capacity to provide assistance.

Criminals have lured, kidnapped, and trafficked foreign nationals with fake business opportunities and job offers. These victims are forced to work in online scams including illegal gambling, fake investment schemes and romance fraud.

The security situation in Myanmar remains volatile and unpredictable, and Canadians may have extremely limited access to consular assistance.

### Gems and jewellery purchases

Scams involving gems and jewellery occur. Merchants sell lower-quality items at inflated prices with promises that the items can be resold later at a profit. The guarantees that merchants offer are not always honoured. The Government of Canada cannot assist in obtaining refunds for purchases made.

* Carefully consider all purchases and, more specifically, purchases of gems and jewellery

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

2SLGBTQI+ persons are discriminated against based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or sex characteristics. 2SLGBTQI+ people are vulnerable under Myanmar's criminal laws, and since the 2021 coup, there have increased reports of targeted rape and sexual violence against perceived members of 2SLGBTQI+.

2SLGBTQI+ persons have been harassed and verbally and physically abused. 2SLGBTQI+ people in detention are particularly vulnerable to torture, including sexual violence. Acts of violence are committed against 2SLGBTQI+ persons.

The laws of Myanmar prohibit sexual acts between individuals of the same sex. 2SLGBTQI+ persons should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Myanmar.

### Communications

Telephone services are unreliable in Yangon and difficult to find in other areas. Long-distance calls can be extremely expensive. Electronic communications, including email, may be monitored by local authorities.

VPN and Internet services are often blocked and directly impact the use of WhatsApp and other social media applications thereby restricting communications with Canada.

### Public transportation

Public transportation within Myanmar, including air, rail and sea travel, often does not meet international safety standards. Railway equipment tends to be outdated, and fatal accidents have occurred. Fatal boat and ferry accidents are common. Vessels may be in poor condition and overloading is a common problem.

### Roads

Travel is restricted outside major cities to designated tourist areas only. Permission from local authorities is required to visit certain areas. Military checkpoints on roads are common.

#### Road conditions

Both left-hand and right-hand drive vehicles are used throughout the country. Driving conditions are hazardous, especially after dark. Some roads can become impassable, particularly during the rainy season.

#### Driving habits

Drivers have little regard for traffic regulations and do not follow safe driving practices.

Driving can also be dangerous due to:

* stray livestock
* pedestrians on the road
* poorly maintained vehicles
* poor visibility
* drunk drivers

A driver involved in any accident with a pedestrian is always at fault and is liable to be detained.

### Air travel

We don't make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.
