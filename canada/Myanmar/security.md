# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Armed clashes

Since October 27, 2023, there has been an escalation of conflict in several parts of Myanmar. Multiple armed resistance groups have attacked regime security forces in Mandalay and Sagaing regions, and the following states:

* Chin
* Kachin
* Kayah (formerly Karenni)
* Mon
* Rakhine
* Shan

There has also been an increase in the number of attacks and regime airstrikes resulting in civilian casualties. The armed conflict is expected to continue and could expand to other states and regions and escalate. The security situation is highly volatile and additional violent attacks could occur at any time across the country.

Violent clashes between regime security forces and armed groups have resulted in:

* significant internal displacement
* disrupted access to supplies, cash and goods
* border crossing closures
* casualties

If you are in Myanmar:

* exercise caution and be aware of your surroundings
* expect heightened presence of security forces
* expect increased travel disruptions and roadblocks
* use your judgement to decide the best time and the safest means of exit if you need to move to a safer location
* monitor international media to stay informed about the latest developments and decrees

Disruptions to supply chains and the closing of border crossings in Myanmar may result in shortages of necessities.

* Keep a supply of water, food, medicine and cash on hand.

### Political situation

On February 1, 2021, the Myanmar military detained officials from the elected government and declared a state of emergency, effectively seizing control of the country's governance. Martial law has been imposed in several townships. Curfews are in effect at specific locations and gatherings are banned.

Demonstrations take place regularly across the country, particularly in Yangon and Mandalay. Security forces have been using excessive and lethal force against protesters in several locations. This has resulted in multiple casualties.

Civil unrest and acts of politically motivated violence may occur anywhere and at any time, particularly leading up to and during days or events of national significance. Improvised explosive devices have been used throughout the country, including in major cities such as Yangon, Mandalay, and Nay Pyi Taw. Further attacks targeting public venues frequented by foreigners, such as shopping malls, markets, hotels, bars and restaurants are possible.

The political situation remains unpredictable and could deteriorate further.

If you're in Myanmar:

* maintain a high level of vigilance at all times
* avoid unnecessary movement, especially on occasions of national significance
* regularly review your security practices
* follow political and social developments carefully
* monitor media to stay informed on the evolving situation
* plan to have adequate water and food supplies for at least 4 days
* charge your mobile phone in case of internet, communication and power outages
* avoid all demonstrations and gatherings
* expect roadblocks, searches and a heavy military presence

### Arbitrary enforcement of local laws

Myanmar's military regime arbitrarily enforces local laws, and may carry out random and arbitrary detentions without due process. If you are in Myanmar, you are at risk of arbitrary detention.

If you travel to or remain in Myanmar despite these risks:

* stay indoors
* maintain a low profile when going outside
* avoid concentrations of police and security forces
* comply with the regulations and guidelines from local authorities

### Border areas with Thailand, China, Laos, Bangladesh and India

The security situation along the border varies and can change quickly.

Clashes between the military and armed groups are ongoing in several border regions. This has caused the displacements of hundreds of thousands of civilians to neighbouring countries.

Landmines are also a danger, particularly in border areas. Unmarked landmines can be found in many border regions and pose a significant risk to your safety.

If you travel to border areas despite this advisory:

* exercise extreme caution
* avoid concentrations of police and security forces as well as large gatherings
* follow the instructions of local authorities

### Chin (Paletwa Township), Kachin, Rakhine, and northern Shan States

Fighting between Myanmar regime military forces and non-state armed resistance groups is occurring in these areas and has resulted in a significant number of deaths, the displacement of hundreds of thousands of civilians as well as disruptions to road and rail connections.

In August 2017, there were coordinated attacks on police and security forces in northern Rakhine state. Since December 2018, serious armed clashes between ethnic armed groups and the military have been occurring in parts of northern and central Rakhine State, including in the tourist destination of Mrauk U. Detonations of improvised explosive devices have taken place in Sittwe Township and on the road between Sittwe and Mrauk U.

Violence in the area is ongoing and the situation is volatile. The security situation can deteriorate suddenly and unexpectedly. Be vigilant and follow the instructions of local authorities.

### Travel restrictions

Travel to parts of the country, including to and from land border crossings, are strictly controlled by the Government of Myanmar. As such, there are some parts of the country where Canadian Embassy officials are not allowed to travel freely without permission from the Myanmar government. The Canadian Embassy's ability to deliver consular assistance, including in an emergency, may be limited or delayed in these areas.

The Ministry of Hotels and Tourism maintains lists of permitted and restricted areas. Consult these lists prior to travelling to Myanmar, especially if you plan on travelling outside of popular tourist destinations.

### Inter-communal violence

Inter-communal violence occurs. More than 200 people have been killed in religious violence since June 2012, and more than 140,000 have been displaced (mostly in Rakhine State). Attacks against religious buildings, shops, and homes have taken place in several areas, including the regions of Bago and Mandalay, resulting in injuries, deaths and displaced persons. Tensions remain high, and further violence is possible. Curfews and restrictions may be imposed or changed on short notice.

Incidents of violence, which resulted in injuries and damage to property, occurred in Mandalay in early July 2014. In late March 2014, violent protests targeting the staff and offices of international organizations took place in Sittwe, Rakhine State.

### Security forces

The presence of police and security forces is likely to increase in Yangon and elsewhere in Myanmar on significant dates, including the anniversary of demonstrations led by monks to protest for political reform (September 26) and the anniversary of the 1988 uprising (August 8).

### Crime

#### Violent crime

There have also been incidents of violent crime against foreigners including muggings.

Exercise a high level of personal security awareness at all times.

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching occur. Scams involving gems and jewellery occur. Merchants sell lower-quality items at inflated prices with promises that the items can be resold later at a profit. The guarantees that merchants offer are not always honoured. The Government of Canada cannot assist in obtaining refunds for purchases made.

* Ensure that your personal belongings, passports and other travel documents are secure at all times
* Carefully consider all purchases if you are not knowledgeable about gems and jewellery

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations can occur and have the potential to suddenly turn violent. They can lead to significant disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings
* Follow the advice of local authorities
* Monitor local media

### Water activities

#### Swimming

Exercise caution at beach resorts in Ngwesaung, Chaungtha and Ngapali as there are strong underwater currents and riptides. There are no lifeguards and drownings have occurred.

#### Scuba diving

Exercise caution when considering diving excursions in Myanmar. Rented diving equipment may not meet internationally acceptable safety standards and may not be maintained adequately.

### Trekking

Tourists trekking in remote parts of the country have experienced difficulties with military authorities, even after obtaining prior permission.

### Tourist facilities

Tourist facilities are adequate in Bagan, Inle Lake, Mandalay, Ngapali Beach, Yangon and Taunggyi, but limited elsewhere. Good hotel facilities exist in Nay Pyi Taw, but transportation is limited. Foreign tourists rarely visit Nay Pyi Taw and may be viewed with suspicion. Foreigners can expect to pay several times more than locals for accommodations, domestic flights and entry to tourist sites throughout the country.

### Communications

Telephone services are unreliable in Yangon and are difficult to find in other areas. Long-distance calls can be extremely expensive. There are Internet cafés in Yangon; identification is required, access to certain websites is restricted and records of which websites users have visited are kept. While some websites were unblocked in 2011, many remain inaccessible. Electronic communications, including email, may be monitored by local authorities.

### Public transportation

Public transportation within Myanmar, including air, rail and sea travel, often does not meet international safety standards. Railway equipment tends to be outdated, and fatal accidents have occurred. Boat and ferry accidents causing deaths are common. Vessels may be in poor condition and overloading is a common problem.

### Road safety

Travel is restricted outside major cities to designated tourist areas only. Permission from local authorities is required to visit certain areas. Military checkpoints on roads are common.

The general condition of automobiles does not meet minimal international standards. There is a combination of both left-hand and right-hand drive vehicles in use throughout the country. Driving can be hazardous, especially after dark. Some roads can become impassable, particularly during the rainy season. Drivers have little regard for traffic regulations and do not follow safe-driving practices. It is common for pedestrians and livestock to walk on roads. A driver involved in any accident with a pedestrian is always at fault and is liable to be detained.

### Air travel

We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.
