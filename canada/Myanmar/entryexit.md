# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Myanmar authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you use for travel.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond the date you expect to leave from Myanmar.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Visas

Tourist visa: required   
Business visa: required

A visa is required for tourism and business purposes and is valid for 28 days. It should be obtained prior to travel at a Myanmar diplomatic mission. Both eVisas and multiple-entry business visas are available. Visitors must produce proof of hotel accommodation on arrival. Staying with friends or colleagues is not a valid option for entry into the country.

The Myanmar government has created a visa-on-arrival program to allow select business travellers, including Canadians, to obtain a business visa upon arrival at the Yangon International Airport. Travellers are encouraged not to rely on this option, however, as the program’s requirements and eligibility criteria remain unclear. It is strongly recommended that all travellers, including business travellers, carefully verify visa requirements and options with the nearest Embassy of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar before travelling.

Foreign journalists have had difficulty obtaining visas, and some have been denied entry upon arrival despite having received a visa. In the past, journalists, and tourists mistaken for journalists, have been denied entry when travelling on tourist visas, have been harassed and have had film and notes confiscated upon leaving the country.

Travel to parts of Myanmar is strictly controlled by government authorities. Foreigners have been deported and detained for visa offences.

### Port of entry

You should use the same port of entry (e.g. Yangon International Airport) to enter and exit Myanmar to avoid problems with immigration services.

### Border crossings

We strongly advise against all travel to Myanmar, including through its land borders, due to the ongoing conflict. You could be caught in violent clashes.

If you decide to travel, know that land border crossing hours of operation are unpredictable and could leave you stranded on either side of the border. Border crossings may close with little or no notice, and entry may be restricted to the nationals of the bordering states and/or to the immediate area or border town.

Some government-authorized tour companies may be able to secure the appropriate permission from the Ministry of Hotels and Tourism to cross these borders in advance, through a process separate from the required visa application.
