## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

The Canadian embassy does not normally receive timely notification of the detention, arrest or deportation of Canadian citizens in Myanmar. If you are arrested or jailed you should request immediate contact with the Embassy of Canada to Myanmar. Research laws before travelling, especially for an extended stay.

A foreigner who has broken the law is subject to deportation upon payment of fine or completion of prison sentence.

### Blasphemy

Under Myanmar law, insulting religion is a prosecutable offence. This includes any disrespectful treatment, depiction or image (including tattoos) of Buddha or other religious representation, or wearing any tattoo of Buddha anywhere below the waist. Foreign nationals have been sentenced to prison, fined and/or deported for breaking this law.

Missionary activities and the importation of religious materials are illegal without the written permission of the Myanmar authorities.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect imprisonment or a death sentence.

### Travel restrictions

Under Myanmar's immigration act, tourists are required to stay in registered hotels, motels, inns, guest houses or resorts. You must show your passport and valid visa at domestic airports, train stations, hotels and security checkpoints. It is illegal to enter restricted areas without authorization.

### Political activism

Political activism (including the dissemination of printed materials), protests, demonstrations and unauthorized assemblies are not tolerated in Myanmar. Freedom of speech and political activities are restricted, and the Myanmar government is very sensitive to any expression of opposition to its rule. Foreigners criticizing the regime in public may be arrested or detained.

### Artifacts and gems

A permit is required to purchase or possess cultural or archaeological artifacts. It is illegal to export gems. Foreigners have been arrested, searched and imprisoned for attempting to take Myanmar gems out of the country.

### Photography

Photography of scenes or people that could be considered politically sensitive, such as military installations, security personnel or demonstrations, is prohibited. Offenders could be arrested, deported and have their equipment confiscated. It is also illegal to fly a drone over certain religious installations.

### Driving

[International driving permits](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/documents/international-driving-permit) are not recognized in Myanmar. It is illegal to drive without a Myanmar driver's licence.

### Imports and export

Customs officials strictly limit what is brought into and out of the country. Baggage is examined and may be searched upon arrival. It is illegal to enter or exit Myanmar with religious materials. Foreign currency in excess of US$10,000 must be declared upon arrival; failure to do so could result in imprisonment. Importation of communications equipment such as mobile phones and laptop computers has been restricted. Laptop computers have been taken from tourists and held at the airport until their departure. Customs regulations on prohibited imports and exports are often unclear and further advice on this subject should be sought from the nearest Myanmar embassy or consulate.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

The laws of Myanmar prohibit sexual acts between individuals of the same sex.

2SLGBTQI+ persons should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Myanmar.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Myanmar.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of Myanmar, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

[Dual citizens](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/documents/dual-citizenship)

The Myanmar authorities activated a 2010 conscription law that came into effect on February 10, 2024. If local authorities consider you a citizen of Myanmar, you may be subject to military obligations requiring all men aged 18-35 and all women aged 18-27 to serve at least two years in the army, with possible extensions up to five years during a state of emergency. The current state of emergency began in February 2021 and has been extended to July 31, 2024. Future extensions are likely. There is no guarantee that travelling with a Canadian passport will provide protection from this law.

You may face up to three years in prison plus a fine, if you evade or ignore a summons to serve. The Government of Canada continues to recommend that Canadian travellers avoid all travel to Myanmar and take this advice seriously.

The Embassy of Canada in Myanmar is extremely limited in its ability to assist Canadian citizens who might be detained in Myanmar.

You should always travel using your valid Canadian passport and present yourself as Canadian to foreign authorities at all times to minimize the risk of your Canadian citizenship being denied. You may also need to carry and present a Myanmar passport for legal reasons, for example to enter and exit the country.

Citizenship is determined solely by national laws, and the decision to recognize dual citizenship rests completely with the country in which you are located when seeking consular assistance. If you are a Canadian citizen, you will require a valid Canadian passport to re-enter Canada.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Myanmar.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Myanmar by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Myanmar to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Dress and behaviour

Exercise common sense and discretion in dress and behaviour, particularly when visiting religious sites. Dress conservatively and respect religious and social traditions to avoid offending local sensitivities or breaking the law.

### Money

The currency of Myanmar is the kyat (MMK). U.S. currency is widely accepted; however, only new, unmarked and undamaged bank notes are accepted. Other foreign currencies are not accepted. There are a few official currency exchange offices in Yangon, including one at the Yangon International Airport. It is illegal to exchange currency at unauthorized locations.

Carry enough cash to cover all of your expenses while in Myanmar. Credit cards are not widely accepted. Even where credit card facilities do exist, Internet connections may be too slow to enable credit cards to be a reliable payment method. Traveller's cheques are never accepted and debit cards are not used for direct purchases. It is possible to find some internationally linked ABMs in Myanmar, but the daily withdrawal limits are low and the machines are often out of service. Neither cash advances via credit or debit card nor cheque-cashing services are available.
