### MYANMAR - AVOID ALL TRAVEL

[Avoid all travel](#levels "Risk Levels") to Myanmar due to the risk of:

* politically-motivated violence
* terrorist attacks
* kidnapping
* arbitrary arrest and detention
* civil unrest during the ongoing armed conflict

If you're in Myanmar:

* leave now if you can do so safely
* shelter in a safe place if you're in an area with ongoing conflict
* be aware that the Government of Canada's ability to provide consular assistance and other support in this country is extremely limited
* keep in mind that you are responsible for your own safety and that of your family

Canadians in need of consular assistance should contact the [Emergency Watch and Response Centre](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-assistance).

We strongly recommend that Canadians sign up with the [Registration of Canadians Abroad service](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/registration) to receive important information.
