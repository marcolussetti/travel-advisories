## Natural disasters and climate

Lebanon is located in a seismic zone. There have been several minor earthquakes in recent years.

In the winter months, mountain roads, including the main Beirutâ€“Damascus highway, may be temporarily blocked or become impassable due to heavy snowfall. Flash floods can occur, rendering roads temporarily dangerous or impracticable.
