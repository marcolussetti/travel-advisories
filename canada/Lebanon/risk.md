### Lebanon - AVOID ALL TRAVEL

[Avoid all travel](#levels "Risk Levels") to Lebanon due to the unpredictable security situation, the continued risk of terrorist attacks and the conflict with Israel. The areas south of the Litani River are particularly dangerous and should strictly be avoided

The security situation can deteriorate further without warning. For emergency consular assistance, contact the [Emergency Watch and Response Centre](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-assistance) in Ottawa.

Register and update your contact information through the Registration of Canadians Abroad service to receive the latest information from the Government of Canada, including available commercial departure options.

If you choose to stay in Lebanon, you should not rely on the Government of Canada for eventual evacuation.

Make sure your travel documents and those of your eligible family members are up to date and secure at all times.
