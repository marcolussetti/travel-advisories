## Risk level

### Lebanon - AVOID NON-ESSENTIAL TRAVEL

[Avoid non-essential travel](#levels "Risk Levels") to Lebanon due to ongoing hostilities in the region, the unpredictable security situation, the continued risk of terrorist attacks and the conflict with Israel.

The security situation could deteriorate further without warning. For emergency consular assistance, contact the [Emergency Watch and Response Centre](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-assistance) in Ottawa.

Register and update your contact information through the Registration of Canadians Abroad service to receive the latest information from the Government of Canada, including available commercial departure options.

In the event that the armed conflict intensifies, commercial means to depart the country may be impacted. The Government of Canada’s ability to provide consular services during an active conflict, including the evacuation of citizens, may be limited.

Make sure your travel documents and those of your eligible family members are up to date and secure at all times.
