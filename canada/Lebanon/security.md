## Safety and security

### Ongoing hostilities in the Middle East

The security situation in the region could deteriorate significantly without notice.

There are reports of military debris falling in various locations. This may result in disruptions to movement and transportation, including:

* border closures or restrictions
* flight cancellations
* airspace closures

You should:

* monitor local and international media to stay informed of the rapidly evolving situation
* be vigilant and follow the instructions of local authorities at all times, including any orders to shelter in place
* sign up with the [Registration of Canadians Abroad](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/registration) service to receive important information about the crisis
* ensure that your travel documents and those of your family are up to date

### Hostilities with Israel

On November 27, 2024, a ceasefire took effect between Israel and Lebanon. The security situation in Lebanon remains volatile and unpredictable as hostilities could resume at any time.

Previous air strikes reached populated areas across Lebanon, including in the Beqaa valley, central Beirut and its suburbs, often resulting in casualties.

### Security situation

The security situation in Lebanon is volatile, especially due to the armed conflict with Israel.

Intensive military activity in southern Lebanon has led to the displacement of thousands of people towards the north of the country and caused major humanitarian needs. The conflict has also exacerbated longstanding sectarian tensions, increasing the risk of violent incidents.

While some airlines have resumed their service to Beirut Rafic Hariri International Airport, disruptions on short notice are possible due to airspace closures, flight cancellations and/or diversions.

If you intend to travel to Lebanon despite the advisory in effect:

* consult local authorities and/or experienced local partners to seek their advice in the event of an attack
* plan a secure route
* monitor the security situation where you are travelling
* consult your travel insurance policy

If you are already in Lebanon:

* be extremely vigilant and aware of your surroundings
* book a flight to leave the country now, if you can do so safely
* expect a heightened security presence
* carry identification documents at all times
* make sure your passport and [travel documents](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/lebanon-2023.html) are up-to-date, including those of your family
* register and update your contact information through the [Registration of Canadians Abroad](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/registration) service and encourage other Canadian citizens in Lebanon to do so

You may need to stock up on food, water and medications in the event of emergency situations.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

2SLGBTQI+ persons are discriminated against based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression or sex characteristics. Incitement to violence and attacks on 2SLGBTQI+ persons occur. On August 23, 2023, members of an organized group stormed a queer-friendly bar in Beirut and physically attacked clients.

There are reports of individuals using popular dating apps and websites to threaten, extort and blackmail 2SLGBTQI+ persons.

* Beware of people who show a keen interest online
* You could be the victim of a scam if you agree to meet with an online acquaintance
* Always meet new acquaintances in a secure and familiar location
* Inviting a stranger to your hotel room or apartment can be risky

### 

### Areas South of Litani River

The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) maintains additional peacekeepers south of the Litani River near the border with Israel due to the security situation. This region remains highly militarized and volatile. Rocket launches and border incidents resulting in casualties occur, provoking retaliatory attacks in this region and elsewhere in Lebanon.

Forces other than the Lebanese authorities exert significant control over parts of this region. Access restrictions may delay or prevent Canadian officials from providing assistance to citizens in these areas.

The international border between Lebanon and Israel is not entirely defined. UNIFIL enforces the Blue Line, which separates the two countries. Areas adjacent to the Blue Line are often heavily mined. The areas of Ghajar, Kfar Shouba Hills and Shebaa Farms are inaccessible from Lebanon. The border with Israel is closed.

If you are travelling to the city of Tyre, use only the main coastal highway. Travel permits from Lebanese authorities and/or UNIFIL may be required to enter areas south of the Litani River that border Israel.

### Southern Suburbs of Beirut

Armed groups are present in large parts of Beirut’s southern suburbs. These neighbourhoods are targets for organized crime and terrorist attacks causing deaths and injuries. Tactics used by terrorists include car bombing, suicide bombing and rocket fire. There is also a risk of kidnapping and you could be caught in violent clashes between armed groups.

### North Lebanon

While Lebanese security forces have conducted operations in northern Lebanon to improve the security situation, some parts of the region remain unstable. Some of these areas have experienced inter-communal violence that can spread to outlying areas. Heavy weapons fire (machine guns, grenades and rocket-propelled grenades), sniper activity and terrorist incidents have occurred.

Extremist groups have sought refuge in northern Lebanon, including throughout Akkar District.

### Border region with Syria

The security situation in regions bordering Syria has deteriorated as a result of the ongoing conflict. Armed groups as well as the Lebanese and Syrian military have carried out operations resulting in casualties. Tensions between armed groups have also increased in border areas, resulting in violent clashes and kidnappings.

The border is not always clearly marked.

### North Eastern Bekaa Valley

The security situation in the North Eastern Bekaa Valley is volatile and there is an ongoing risk of sporadic violence, organized crime, and kidnapping.

### Palestinian refugee camps

The security situation in Palestinian refugee camps and surrounding areas remains tense and unpredictable. Violence is common in some camps—particularly Ain el Helweh, near Saida, and Beddawi, near Tripoli.

Refugee camps are often located close to urban centres and are not always visibly demarcated. Exercise caution and remain aware of your whereabouts at all times in order to avoid unknowingly entering a camp. Palestinian authorities control the security in most camps and may delay or refuse to grant Canadian officials access to Canadian in these areas.

### Terrorism

There’s a threat of terrorism. Attacks can occur at any time and any place in Lebanon.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, military installations and schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Local authorities are on a high state of alert and carry out anti-terrorism operations across the country to prevent attacks. The potential for attacks and a rapid deterioration of the security situation remains across the country, including in Beirut.

There is a significant presence of terrorist groups in several areas of southern Lebanon, including in the southern suburbs of Beirut and the northern Bekaa Valley. Armed actors other than Lebanese authorities exert a large amount of control in some areas, and they may delay or prevent Canadian officials from assisting Canadians in the region.

Politically-motivated attacks also remain likely. A number of such attacks have taken place in the southern suburbs of Beirut.

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places. Be particularly vigilant during sporting events, religious holidays and other public celebrations. Terrorists may use such occasions to mount attacks.

### Shortages

#### Fuel

Lebanon is experiencing chronic fuel shortages. You may have some difficulties securing fuel.

There are frequent, prolonged and unpredictable closures of fuel stations. Long lineups have formed at gas stations, creating road blockades which have led to several accidents. Arguments and violent altercations, sometimes involving use of weapons have also occurred. Decrease in fuel quality has also been reported causing damages to vehicles.

Fuel and diesel shortages are also impacting other sectors such as:

* transport
* telecommunication, including internet
* water and waste collection
* shops, cafes and restaurants

The difficulty to access fuel and diesel has led to frequent unplanned closures of power generators and interruptions in the delivery of basic commodities such as water, flour, and gas.

#### Medicine and medical supplies

There are shortages of medicine and medical supplies. When available, these may be very costly. Such shortages have also significantly affected the health care sector, with many private hospitals closing or reducing their services.

Ensure that your emergency kit is complete.

#### Exchange rates and foreign currency

In recent months, the value of the Lebanese Pound has depreciated quickly against the US Dollar. As a result, there is a high inflation on prices of most goods and services. The economic situation could affect your ability to pay for goods and services.

There is also a severe shortage of foreign currency. It is very difficult to access US Dollars locally. Change in foreign currency may also not be available. While ATMs are generally stocked with Lebanese Pounds, there may be limits on daily withdrawals imposed by certain banks.

Many stores and companies no longer accept credit/debit cards.

* Plan accordingly
* Ensure that you have access to adequate cash
* Avoid carrying large sums of cash on yourself and keep foreign currency out of sight

#### Power disruptions

Power outages and rationing of electricity are common in many parts of the country, including in Beirut. They may affect critical infrastructure, such as hospitals. They could also affect other essential services such as food production and distribution.

Other services are often disrupted during such events, including:

* public water supply
* communications, mainly cellular telephone and Internet
* banking

### Demonstrations

The deterioration of the security environment and the political uncertainty in the country may lead to an increase in civil unrest at any time. Planned and spontaneous demonstrations related to the domestic and regional situations regularly occur in Lebanon, particularly in Beirut.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

There are still sporadic closures on roads to Beirut–Rafic Hariri International Airport due to various factors, including demonstrations and clashes between various local groups. Access to the airport may be unavailable for extended periods when the security situation deteriorates.

* Avoid all areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Allow extra time to get to and from the airport
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Kidnapping

Kidnappings have occurred in the border areas with Syria, in the Bekaa Valley and could happen in other parts of Lebanon. In the southern suburbs of Beirut, foreigners and residents have been held against their will. Although most incidents of kidnapping typically involve Lebanese residents, foreigners have also been targeted. Maintain a high level of vigilance at all times.

### Landmines

Landmines and unexploded ordnance continue to pose a threat in some parts of the country, including south of the Litani River and near the northeastern border region.

* Look for posted landmine warnings
* Stay on paved roads
* Avoid walking or hiking in these areas.

### Crime

Petty crime has significantly increased since 2020. Purse snatching, pick pocketing, car thefts, and residential break-ins, occur regularly.

There are reports of thefts at Beirut’s international airport. Criminals have stolen goods from luggage, looking especially for medications.

* Be vigilant in all crowded locations
* Don’t carry large sums of money
* Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times

Violent crime and sexual assault have also increased. Shooting incidents, especially at gas stations, have led to injuries and deaths of civilians.

There is a highly visible security presence throughout the country.

* Exercise vigilance and appropriate safety precautions
* Carry personal documentation with you and follow the instructions of Lebanese security authorities

### Road safety

Congestion and aggressive driving are serious problems throughout the country. Drivers often don’t respect the rules of the road, and traffic laws are not consistently enforced. Be cautious when crossing streets, as drivers don’t always give pedestrians and cyclists the right of way.

Road accidents and serious road rage incidents causing injury or death are common in Lebanon.

Road lighting is sporadic and unreliable in urban areas and virtually non-existent in rural areas. At night, many drivers use their high beams exclusively, often creating a serious hazard due to blinding glare. Increased power cuts have led to interruptions of traffic lights in the city centre, including at major intersections.

### Public transportation

Avoid public transportation, which is crowded, unsafe and unreliable.

#### Taxi

Foreigners using shared transportation have been victims of armed robbery, either by the driver or other passengers. Most major hotel chains will have an agreement with a reputable taxi company and can arrange the taxi for you.

* Don’t use shared or “service” taxis.
* Always pre-arrange transportation with a safe and reliable taxi company.
* Don’t hail taxis off the street and avoid using unmarked taxi services.

### Air travel

We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.
