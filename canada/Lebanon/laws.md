## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Photography

It is prohibited to photograph or videotape government buildings or military personnel, equipment and installations.

Avoid photographing individuals without their permission.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect jail sentences and heavy fines.

Individuals charged with drug offences can expect to remain in jail and to be denied bail throughout the judicial process. This process often takes years.

### Dress and behaviour

The dress code in Lebanon is more relaxed than most Middle Eastern countries.

To avoid offending local sensitivities:

* dress conservatively
* behave discreetly
* respect religious and social traditions

### Driving

Ensure your travel insurance is valid for driving in Lebanon.

You must carry an international driving permit.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Lebanon. However, local authorities will treat dual Canadian-Lebanese citizens as Lebanese nationals.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of Lebanon, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

### Family law

Family law matters in Lebanon, including child custody and divorce-related decisions, are settled according to local religious laws.

Canadian custody documents, including Canadian court orders pertaining to custody, may not be automatically recognized or enforceable in Lebanon.

Relatives frequently place travel bans on Canadians. If you are involved in custody or other family disputes, consult a lawyer for advice on how religious law in Lebanon may affect your family situation.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Lebanon.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Lebanon by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Lebanon to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Money

The currency is the Lebanese pound (LBP).

There is also a severe shortage of foreign currency. It is very difficult to access US Dollars locally. Change in foreign currency may not be available. While ATMs are generally stocked with Lebanese Pounds, there may be limits on daily withdrawals imposed by certain banks.

Many stores and companies no longer accept credit/debit cards.

Traveller’s cheques are not accepted and will not be changed by local financial institutions.
