# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Lebanese authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond the date you expect to leave Lebanon.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

As a Canadian citizen, you must obtain a visa to visit Lebanon. Ensure you apply for the proper type of visa for the specific purpose of your trip. Visas are available at Lebanese diplomatic missions abroad or at any port of entry into Lebanon.

Make sure your visa is valid for the duration of your stay. An expired entry visa must be extended by Lebanese authorities or you will not be allowed to leave the country.

### Entry stamp

Your passport must show a Lebanese entry stamp in order to exit the country. If you acquire a new passport while in Lebanon, you must present your old passport containing proof of entry to authorities upon departure.

### Travel bans

Local authorities may issue travel bans that won’t allow you to enter or exit Lebanon, regardless of your nationality.

You may also be denied re-entry to Lebanon if you left Lebanon as a refugee. To ensure that you are not subject to a travel ban to re-enter Lebanon, contact the Lebanese authorities prior to your departure to Lebanon

### Regional travel

Travel to or from Israel is illegal in Lebanon. You may be refused entry into Lebanon if your passport bears an Israeli visa, an Israeli border stamp, or an Egyptian or Jordanian border stamp issued by an office bordering Israel, as such a stamp could indicate you visited Israel prior to visiting Lebanon.

### South of the Litani River

Travel permits from Lebanese authorities and/or UNIFIL may be required to enter areas south of the Litani River bordering Israel.

### Children and travel

Children travelling with only one parent may be required to provide an authorization letter from the other parent to exit Lebanon.
