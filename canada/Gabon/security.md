# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Elections

Parliamentary and local elections are scheduled to take place in Gabon on September 27 and October 11, 2025.

Local authorities may adjust security measures and restrict movement.

Even peaceful gatherings can occasionally lead to disruptions or affect traffic and public transportation.

If you are in Gabon:

* avoid demonstrations and large gatherings
* expect an increased presence of security forces
* monitor local media to stay informed of the latest information
* follow the instructions of local authorities

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations occur. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can lead also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Pickpocketing, theft and “smash and grab” robberies occur.

Vehicle break-ins are common, particularly in markets, transportation hubs and areas frequented by tourists.

* Keep car doors locked, windows and your belongings out of sight
* Ensure that your personal belongings, including passports and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Avoid showing signs of affluence and carrying large sums of cash

#### Violent crime

Crime is more common in Libreville and Port Gentil than in rural areas.

* Although rare, violent crime occurs, including business and residential robberies and armed attacks
* Be vigilant at all times, particularly in Libreville and Port Gentil
* Avoid walking alone after dark, even in places visited by tourists
* Avoid walking alone in isolated areas, including beaches, particularly at night

Resisting a robbery can lead to further violence.

#### Fraud

Fraud involving the use of a credit card and ATMs occurs in Gabon. Be cautious when using debit or credit cards:

* pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others
* use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety can vary greatly throughout the country.

Driving can be hazardous. Outside urban areas, road conditions are poor and there are very few road signs. Insufficient lighting and overloaded vehicles also pose hazards. If possible, use a four-wheel-drive vehicle, particularly outside urban areas.

In the event of a traffic accident, go to the nearest police station to avoid possible confrontations.

Cooperate with local authorities and avoid travelling after dark.

Towing and repair services are not widely available outside Libreville.

### Roadblocks

Roadblocks are very common throughout the country, especially outside of Libreville.

Security forces may ask you to identify yourself and justify your itinerary.

* Expect a heightened security presence
* Don’t drive through a roadblock without stopping, even if it seems unguarded
* If you are stopped, follow the security force’s instructions
* Always carry your identification, driver’s license and vehicle registration documents
* Cary a copy of your hotel reservation, airline tickets, bookings for planned activities and any other documents that may justify your itinerary and the reason for your stay in Gabon

### Public transportation

Public transportation such as trains or buses are available.

#### Taxis

If you’re taking taxis in the cities, negotiate the price before getting in the cab. Taxi drivers may pick up more than one fare at a time. Drivers may charge more if they don’t pick up any other fares during your ride. Most taxi drivers automatically double their fares after 9 pm. Avoid taking taxis alone, particularly at night.

### Piracy

Pirate attacks and armed robbery against ships occur in coastal waters. Mariners should take appropriate precautions.
