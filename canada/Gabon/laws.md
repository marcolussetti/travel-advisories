## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Identification

You may be asked to prove your identity and date of entry into the country. Failure to provide internationally recognized identification could result in detention. Carry photo identification, such as a photocopy of your passport, and keep another photocopy of your passport in a safe place, in case it’s lost or confiscated.

### Driving

You should carry an international driving permit that must be used along with a Canadian driver’s licence. It can only be used for the first 30 days of a visit in Gabon.

Drivers must carry on their person or in the vehicle:

* a valid licence
* proof of insurance
* proof of inspection
* a reflective vest and an emergency triangle
* a fire extinguisher and a first aid kit

The use of a cellular telephone while driving is prohibited.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Gabon.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Gabon, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Gabon.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Gabon by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Gabon to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Gabonese law does not prohibit sexual acts between individuals of the same sex. However, homosexuality is not widely accepted in Gabonese society.

2SLGBTQI+ persons should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Gabon.

### Money

The currency in Gabon is the African Financial Community (CFA) franc (XAF).

Exchange rates are those quoted by the Bank of Central African States. Euros and U.S. dollars are widely accepted, but high exchange charges may apply. Credit cards are accepted only in Libreville’s large hotels, restaurants and supermarkets.

ATMs are available, but cash withdrawals are limited. If possible, use cash for all transactions.
