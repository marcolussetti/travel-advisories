### Trading of precious stones

You’ll need a government licence to buy or sell precious stones. There are stiff fines for smuggling.

### Photography

It’s illegal to photograph:

* government buildings
* military and police facilities
* the presidential palace
* airports
* power plants.

Power plants may not be clearly marked. Unauthorized photography may result in immediate seizure of your equipment by authorities. Never photograph people without their permission.

### Identification

Always carry your identity documents (or notarized copies) with you. Failing to do so could result in your arrest and imprisonment.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Central African Republic.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Central African Republic, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and the Central African Republic.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in the Central African Republic by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in the Central African Republic to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Central African law does not prohibit sexual acts between individuals of the same sex. However, homosexuality is not widely socially accepted.

2SLGBTQI+ persons could face arrest under other charges, such as public indecency.

2SLGBTQI+ persons should carefully consider the risks of travelling to the Central African Republic.

### Money

The currency in the Central African Republic is the African Financial Community franc (XAF). Only Bangui’s major hotels accept international credit cards and the Carte Bleue debit card.

The exchange rate for cash is much lower than for traveller’s cheques. Banks charge a commission on traveller’s cheques. You can only exchange currency in Bangui and Berbérati.
