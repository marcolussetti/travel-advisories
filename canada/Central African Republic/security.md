# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Security situation

The political and security situation remains unstable in the Central African Republic. Military operations are regularly taking place throughout the country and armed criminal groups are committing acts of violence in several regions. The security situation is more stable in Bangui but could deteriorate rapidly.

Security forces cannot guarantee the safety of civilians. Humanitarian workers, travellers and foreigners have been targeted, especially outside Bangui.

If you are in the Central African Republic despite this advisory, take the necessary precautions to ensure your safety. Security conditions are fragile and can deteriorate suddenly. The Government of Canada’s ability to provide consular assistance in the Central African Republic is extremely limited.

### Curfew

Armed groups are present throughout the country. To stabilize the situation, local authorities have imposed a nationwide curfew, in effect from 12 am to 5 am, except in Bangui, where there is no curfew.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations occur, particularly during election periods. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to significant disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations
* Avoid movement in the event of civil unrest

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and bag snatching, occurs frequently. In Bangui, be particularly vigilant in the PK5 district and its surroundings.

During your trip:

* be aware of your surroundings, especially in crowded areas
* keep your personal belongings, including your passport and your other travel documents in a secure place
* avoid showing signs of affluence, wearing expensive jewellery or visibly displaying electronics
* do not carry large sums of cash or valuables unnecessarily
* avoid walking alone after dark

#### Violent crime

Violent crime occurs frequently, particularly at night, outside Bangui and on major roads. Incidents include:

* armed robbery
* assault, including sexual assault
* home invasions
* burglary
* carjackings

During your trip:

* do not travel at night
* stay in accommodations with adequate security measures
* keep doors and windows locked at all times
* do not leave valuables within reach or in plain sight
* avoid isolated areas
* do not resist an attack

### Kidnapping

Armed groups and criminals target foreigners, employees of international organizations and Central African nationals. The risk is particularly high outside of Bangui.

### Women’s safety

Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment or verbal abuse.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Central African law does not explicitly criminalize sexual acts between individuals of the same sex. However, 2SLGBTQI+ persons could face arrest under other charges, such as “public indecency,” which is punishable by up to 2 years in prison.

Homosexuality is not socially accepted.

2SLGBTQI+ persons should carefully consider the risks of travelling to the Central African Republic.

### Roads

#### Road safety

There are major road safety issues in the Central African Republic. Armed and criminal groups are present on roads outside Bangui. Fatal accidents are common and often involve pedestrians. Police and emergency services are limited in Bangui and unavailable outside the capital.

#### Roadblocks

In Bangui, police and military roadblocks are set up at night to control crime. However, drivers are regularly extorted by security forces.

Outside Bangui, armed groups and criminals frequently set up roadblocks. There have been cases of theft, assault and violence.

* Avoid travelling at night, including in Bangui
* Avoid all road travel outside Bangui

#### Road conditions

Road conditions and road safety are poor throughout the country. The only paved roads are those from Bangui to Bossembélé, Sibut and Mbaïki. During the rainy season, from May to October, road conditions deteriorate to the point that dirt roads may be impassable for several days.

#### Driving habits

Drivers don’t always respect traffic laws and speeding is common. Priority is not given to pedestrians or other drivers. Drinking and driving is common.

If you plan to travel by car, consider hiring a driver.

If you choose to drive in the Central African Republic:

* always drive defensively
* always keep doors and windows closed and locked
* never leave personal belongings unattended in a vehicle, even in the trunk
* consider using a four-wheel drive vehicle during the rainy season

### Public transport

Public transport services are limited and unsafe. Avoid using them.

#### Taxis

Taxis are frequently involved in traffic accidents. Passengers are sometimes mugged or robbed by taxi drivers.

If you must take a taxi:

* ask for your taxi at the front desk if you’re using hotel services
* only use registered taxis
* make sure the driver does not pick up other passengers on the way to your destination
* ask the driver to start the meter or negotiate the fare in advance
* have small bills available for payment

### Power outages

Access to the electricity network is very limited outside Bangui. Power outages occur regularly throughout the country. Not all buildings are equipped with generators.

Power outages impact essential services, such as:

* public lighting and traffic lights
* medical services
* the public water supply
* telecommunications

### Fuel shortages

Fuel shortages occur regularly.

Local authorities may impose rationing measures for fuel. These measures may lead to the reduction of essential services and line-ups at gas stations.

* Never let your tank go lower than half-full
* Ensure access to fuel
* Plan your car trips accordingly
