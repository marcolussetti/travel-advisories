# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Curfew

The security situation remains volatile and unpredictable.

Central African armed groups are present throughout the country. Local authorities have imposed a nationwide curfew, with the exception of Bangui, in effect from 12 a.m. to 5 a.m. to stabilize the situation.

Political and security conditions remain unstable throughout the Central African Republic. Military operations are ongoing throughout the country. Armed and criminal groups continue to operate in large areas of the country, and they regularly commit acts of violence. They have previously targeted humanitarian workers, road travellers and foreigners mainly outside of the capital.

Security forces cannot guarantee the safety of civilians, particularly outside of Bangui.

If you are in the Central African Republic despite this advisory, take the necessary precautions to ensure your safety. Security conditions can deteriorate suddenly. The Government of Canada’s ability to provide consular assistance in the Central African Republic is extremely limited.

### Prefecture of Haut-Mbomou

Elements of the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) continue to carry out attacks and abductions in the Haut-Mbomou prefecture, in southeastern Central African Republic. The security situation is volatile. The local population continues to flee LRA attacks.

### Bangui

The security situation is generally more stable in Bangui but could deteriorate rapidly. Crime rates remain high in certain areas of Bangui, especially in the PK5 district.

* Avoid any travel after dark
* Avoid any travel to PK5 district

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations may occur. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to significant disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

Avoid moving about Bangui during times of civil unrest.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Crime

Rebel activity, armed attacks and banditry are common. Some attacks are random. Shootings and looting occur frequently.

Westerners and employees of international organizations have been the target of attacks and abductions. The risk of abduction for both nationals and foreigners has increased.

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs regularly.

* Exercise caution at all times
* Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Don’t show signs of affluence
* Carry only certified copies of your travel documents

### Women’s safety

Incidents of sexual assault and domestic violence are common. Women travellers may be subject to harassment and verbal abuse.

* Exercise extreme caution
* Never travel alone at night

### Road safety

#### Road conditions

Road conditions and road safety are poor throughout the country. The only paved roads are those from Bangui to Bossembélé, from Bangui to Sibut and from Bangui to Mbaïki. Driving conditions may be more hazardous during the rainy season, when dirt roads may be closed for hours or even days. Buses, trucks and minibuses are the main means of transportation.

#### Travel outside of Bangui

Avoid any road travel outside Bangui. If you decide to undertake road travel outside Bangui despite this warning, always travel in a four-wheel-drive vehicle, with convoy of at least 2 vehicles and during daylight hours. Regional wars have increased access to weapons, leading to armed attacks and highway robbery.

#### Road blocks

The police and army sometimes set up road blocks.

### Fuel shortages

Fuel shortages occur regularly.

Local authorities may impose rationing measures for fuel. These measures may led to the reduction of essential services and line-ups at gas stations.

* Plan accordingly
* Keep a supply of fuel on hand

### Air travel

We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.
