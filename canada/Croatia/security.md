# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Zagreb Hippodrome concert

A very large-scale music concert is scheduled to take place at the Zagreb Hippodrome on July 5, 2025. Increased security measures will be in place in the period surrounding the concert. More than 500,000 people are expected to attend the event.

* Expect disruptions and road closures
* Allow plenty of time to reach your destination
* Be vigilant near or in large crowds
* Follow the instructions of local authorities

### Crime

The violent crime rate is low. Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, is common.

Organized groups of pickpockets often use distraction techniques and are particularly active in:

* main cities
* public transportation hubs
* hotel lobbies
* restaurants, patios and outdoor cafés
* tourist sites and attractions

While in Croatia:

* avoid showing signs of affluence and carrying large sums of cash
* ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* don’t leave luggage unattended at airport check-in or ticket counters, car rental desks or hotel lobbies
* don’t leave luggage or valuables in a vehicle, and always park your vehicle in secure facilities
* be cautious when travelling on public transportation and overnight trains
* carry a photocopy or digital copy of your passport identification page, driver’s licence, train or airline tickets and credit cards

### Fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud may occur. Be cautious when using debit or credit cards:

* pay careful attention when others are handling your cards
* use ATMs located in public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

#### Overcharge

Some bars, nightclubs and “cabarets” may try to charge exorbitant prices. Disputes about overcharging may lead to threats of violence, and security guards may force you to pay.

* Always confirm prices before consuming
* Avoid running a tab or leaving your credit card with bar or restaurant staff
* Check your bill to make sure it’s exact

### Spiked food and drinks

Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

### Landmines

While most of the territory has been cleared, landmines and unexploded ordnance may still pose a serious risk in certain areas. These are usually clearly identified and major tourist destinations are not affected.

The Croatian Mine Action Centre maintains a map of suspected minefields and has also developed a free smartphone app to alert users if they enter a danger zone.

If you plan on visiting areas outside of major tourist destinations:

* consult the map of suspected minefields and download the alert app
* pay attention to signs indicating the possible presence of landmines
* remain on paved roads
* avoid open fields, road shoulders and unmarked trails

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in Europe. Terrorists have carried out attacks in several European cities. Terrorist attacks could occur at any time.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places. Be particularly vigilant during:

* sporting events
* religious holidays
* public celebrations
* major political events, such as elections

Terrorists may use such occasions to mount attacks.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations take place from time to time.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Soccer matches and sports events

Sports events sometimes lead to rowdy behaviour and violent incidents.

Be vigilant if you attend soccer matches and sports rallies.

### Water activities

#### Swimming

Coastal waters can be dangerous.

In the fall and winter months, waves can be unpredictable, breaking further than expected and causing strong undertows.

* Be cautious when walking on the shore
* Avoid visiting beaches or coastal areas during periods of severe weather warnings
* Always take into account warning flags at beaches
* Don’t dive into unknown water, as hidden rocks or shallow depths can cause serious injury or death
* Exercise caution and follow the advice of local authorities

#### Recreational boating

If you are planning to go boating:

* know the navigation rules
* follow safe practices for all water activities such as jet-skiing, water-skiing, diving, swimming or fishing
* don’t overload your boat capacity
* carry a VHF marine radio that will generate your position in case of emergency
* be prepared for emergencies

### Mountain activities

Mountain activities, such as hiking, can be dangerous, especially if they are not well prepared. Trails are not always marked and weather conditions can change rapidly, even in summer.

If you intend to go hiking or climbing:

* never do so alone
* consider hiring an experienced guide from a reputable company
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* ensure that you’re properly equipped
* stay informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary
* obtain detailed information on trekking routes before setting out
* do not venture off marked trails
* pay attention to signs indicating the possible presence of landmines

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety can vary greatly throughout the country. Driving conditions may be hazardous on small roads. Many roads are poorly maintained. In Istria and along the Adriatic coast, roads can be congested, narrow and slippery when wet. Many lack guard rails. Accidents involving cyclists have occurred.

Drivers don’t always respect traffic laws.

In Zagreb, always be alert when walking, driving or cycling near tram rails.

### Public transportation

Public transportation in Zagreb is extensive, safe and reliable.

You must validate your ticket before boarding transportation.

#### Train and bus

Main cities and tourist areas are well connected by bus services and trains.

#### Ferries

Ferry services operate between mainland and several islands of the Adriatic coast, particularly during summer.

#### Taxis

Taxis are generally safe. Ridesharing services are available.

* Use only officially marked taxis or a trusted ridesharing app
* Negotiate fares in advance or insist that the driver use the meter, as you may be overcharged
