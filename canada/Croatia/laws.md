## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Transfer to a Canadian prison

Canada and Croatia are signatories to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in Croatia to request a transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both Canadian and Croatia authorities.

This process can take a long time, and there is no guarantee that the transfer will be approved by either or both sides.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect jail sentences or heavy fines.

### Identification

Authorities may request to see your ID at any time.

* Carry valid identification or a photocopy of it at all times
* Keep a photocopy of your passport in case it's lost or seized
* Keep a digital copy of your ID and travel documents

### Public behaviour

Certain municipalities, particularly those with a high number of visitors, have adopted public conduct rules which are strictly enforced by local authorities. Certain behaviours are illegal and may include:

* walking in an urban setting or religious places in swimwear or shirtless
* being drunk on the public way
* sleeping in public areas

Public notices about conduct are usually found in and around tourist areas.

Comply with public regulation. You may be fined if you fail to do so.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Croatia.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Croatia, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Croatia.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Croatia, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Croatian court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Croatia to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Investments

If you plan on buying property or making other investments in Croatia, seek legal advice in Canada and in Croatia. Do so before making commitments. Related disputes could take time and be costly to resolve.

### Customs

If you plan on travelling between countries that are not members of the European Union and Croatia, make sure you are aware of the rules and restrictions regarding the importation of certain items and merchandise such as tobacco.

### Camping

Camping outside organized campsites and designated areas is illegal.

### Driving

As a tourist or temporary resident, you can drive with a valid Canadian driver's licence. You should carry an international driving permit.

Vehicles with foreign licence plates can operate in Croatia for up to 3 months after arrival. After 3 months, you must temporarily register in Croatia.

You must use daytime headlights from the last weekend in October until the last weekend in March. It's also mandatory during episodes of fog and inclement weather. Winter tires are mandatory between 15 November and 15 April.

Motorists must wear a fluorescent vest when attending to a car breakdown along the road.

The "priority to the right" system is in effect in Croatia. Drivers must give way to vehicles approaching from the right at intersections, unless otherwise indicated.

This is often a surprise to foreign drivers and results in accidents.

Familiarize yourself with the "priority to the right" system.

Right turns at red lights are prohibited.

The country has a zero tolerance policy for drinking and driving for:

* professional drivers
* drivers under 24
* anyone involved in an accident

### Money

The currency of Croatia is the euro (EUR).

If you are carrying €10,000 or more, or the equivalent in other currencies or monetary instruments, you must make a declaration to customs when you enter or leave the European Union.

This does not apply if you are travelling within the European Union or in transit to a non-EU country.
