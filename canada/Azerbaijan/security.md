# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Districts in the western part of Azerbaijan

Unexploded ordnance continue to pose a risk in the western part of Azerbaijan, especially in the following districts:

* Aghdam
* Fuzuli
* Jabrayil
* Zangilan
* Gubadli
* Lachin
* Khojali
* Shusha
* Khankendi
* Khojavand
* Kalbajar
* Tartar
* Aghdara

You must have special travel permission from Azerbaijani authorities to enter these areas.

The Government of Canada’s ability to provide consular services in these regions is extremely limited.

If you decide to travel to districts in the western part of Azerbaijan despite the advisory in effect:

* be extremely vigilant in remote areas
* stay on paved and main roads
* don’t walk in fields
* avoid roadside ditches, shoulders and unmarked trails
* pay attention to signs indicating the possible presence of unexploded ordnance
* report any suspicious items to local authorities

### Border areas with Armenia

The Government of Canada’s ability to provide emergency in-person consular services in areas along the Armenia-Azerbaijan international borders is extremely limited.

The security environment remains highly volatile at the border between Azerbaijan and Armenia.

There have been numerous armed clashes since 2020 and tensions could resume at any time.

Border areas with Armenia are subject to extremely dangerous military activities, such as:

* mortar and artillery shelling
* rocket fire
* drone attacks
* heavy gunfire

If you choose to travel near the border with Armenia despite this advisory:

* exercise caution at all times
* avoid travelling at night
* monitor local and international media to stay informed on clashes
* follow instructions from local authorities and security forces

### Crime

Crime is relatively low. Most reported crimes involve burglary, assault or petty crime, such as pickpocketing.

Thieves sometimes pose as police officers and demand that tourists pay on-the-spot fines. If faced with this situation, offer to follow the officer to the nearest police station to pay the fine.

* Avoid walking alone after dark
* Be careful in areas that attract large crowds and areas that are very isolated or dimly lit
* Don’t carry large amounts of cash
* Don’t display signs of affluence
* Ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times

### Fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud occurs. Be cautious when using debit or credit cards:

* pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others
* use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

If you’re travelling to Azerbaijan to meet someone you’ve only met online, you may be the victim of a scam.

### Spiked food and drinks

There have been incidents of drink spiking, resulting in victims being robbed.

Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations take place from time to time.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. Police may use force to suppress demonstrations.

They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism. Terrorist attacks could occur at any time.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings in public places.

Stay at hotels that have robust security measures. Keep in mind, however, that even the most secure locations can’t be considered completely free of risk.

### Road Safety

Highways and major city roads are well-maintained, but driving can still be dangerous due to poor driving standards and poorly maintained cars. Many drivers do not pay attention to speed limit, traffic rules and traffic signs. Insufficient street lighting and signage make travel dangerous outside of Baku. The risk increases on certain roads that are shared with pedestrians and livestock.

Authorities don’t enforce traffic rules consistently.

Pedestrians should exercise caution.

### Public transportation

Buses are poorly maintained, often overcrowded and unsafe, particularly outside of Baku. Baku Metro is reasonably maintained and has basic safety equipment. Expect to see security cameras throughout the platforms and a police presence at each metro station, particularly at night.

Only use officially marked taxis, which are metered, have seatbelts and are cheaper than unmarked taxis. Avoid shared taxis and unofficial taxis because passengers have been assaulted.

If you must travel by train, store personal belongings in a safe place and don’t leave your compartment unattended. Ensure the door is secured from the inside.

We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.
