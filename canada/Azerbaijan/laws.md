## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Illegal or restricted activities

It is strictly forbidden to take pictures of military installations and equipment. Trespassing on military sites can lead to arrest. Visitors have been detained and questioned when attempting to photograph military bases, equipment and installations, all of which are considered sensitive.

Promoting religion and trying to convert others are not permitted.

### Identification

Carry your passport at all times. Keep a photocopy of your passport in a safe place in case it’s lost or confiscated. If you are a resident, you must provide proof of residency status. Police checks in public areas are common. You could be fined if you fail to provide proper identification on request from an official.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect jail sentences of 3 to 7 years and/or heavy fines.

### Dual citizenship

Azerbaijan doesn’t legally recognize dual citizenship for adults (those 18 or older).

If local authorities consider you a citizen of Azerbaijan, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

A citizen of Azerbaijan who has adopted citizenship of a foreign country needs to provide written information to the relevant Azerbaijani executive authority within a month.

If you are in Azerbaijan, refer to the State Migration Service. If you are outside of the country, then refer to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan or one of the Republic of Azerbaijan’s diplomatic missions accredited to the country where you reside.

Canadians with Azerbaijani citizenship may be subject to national obligations, such as taxes and military service, and should check their status with the Embassy of the Republic of Azerbaijan to Canada prior to travelling.

Military service is mandatory for male Azerbaijani citizens between the ages of 18 and 35. Those who have not completed their military service could face fines or arrest.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Azerbaijan.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Azerbaijan by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Azerbaijan to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Imports and exports

Customs authorities strictly enforce regulations concerning the import or export of firearms, religious materials, pieces of art and antiquities.

You must declare foreign currency upon entry. You can’t leave the country with more than you brought in.

### Dress and behaviour

Azerbaijan is a secular state, but some people closely adhere to Islamic practices and beliefs.

* Behave discreetly
* Respect religious and social traditions to avoid offending local sensitivities

In 2026, the lunar month of Ramadan is expected to begin on or around February 17.

### Money

The currency of Azerbaijan is the Azerbaijani manat (AZN).

The economy is mostly cash-based. Credit cards are accepted at banks in Baku and in major hotels and restaurants. Few establishments accept credit cards outside of Baku. Several ATMs in major cities dispense both U.S. dollars and Azerbaijani manat.
