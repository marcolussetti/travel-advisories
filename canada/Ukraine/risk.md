### Ukraine - AVOID ALL TRAVEL

[Avoid all travel](#levels "Risk Levels") to Ukraine due to the Russian military invasion. Your safety is at high risk, particularly if you engage in active combat.

Russia launches missile and drone strikes against Ukrainian civilian and government infrastructure. These include attacks on city centres and populated areas, including Kyiv. The ongoing Russian invasion poses a significant security risk, even if you are not near the front lines.

If you are in Ukraine, you should consider leaving the country if you can do so safely.

Our ability to provide consular services in Ukraine is severely limited.
