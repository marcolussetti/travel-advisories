## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Identification

Local police may ask to see your passport and visa at any time.

* Carry adequate identification at all times
* Keep a photocopy or digital copy of your passport in a safe place, in case of loss or seizure
* Always cooperate with local authorities and be aware that they could detain you while your identification documents are being verified

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect jail sentences and heavy fines.

### Photography

Don’t take pictures of military installations, including mobile or temporary defense equipment or other government buildings. This includes drones flying overhead, air defenses, downed aircraft and drones/missiles as well as damaged or derelict military equipment.

You should be careful when uploading photos or video to social media to ensure that no prohibited buildings or equipment appear in your content, even in the background. You could face arrest and jail time if you take or upload photos or videos with prohibited content visible.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Ukraine.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of Ukraine, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

If you were born in Ukraine and lived there after 1991, and have not renounced your Ukrainian citizenship, you are considered a Ukrainian citizen. Canadian citizens born in Ukraine, or born to Ukrainian parents, may unknowingly have Ukrainian citizenship.

Due to the ongoing Russian military invasion, men between 18 and 60 years of age holding Ukrainian citizenship are prohibited from leaving the country.

### Mandatory military service (mobilization)

Ukraine has mandatory military service for men over the age of 18. Due to the ongoing Russian military invasion, Ukrainian men between 18 and 60 years may be subject to mobilization.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Ukraine.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Ukraine, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Ukrainian court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Ukraine to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Surrogacy and adoption

If you plan to visit Ukraine despite this advisory for the purpose of commissioning surrogacy or adoption arrangements, you should consider the potential challenges involved in pursuing international surrogacy and seek specialist legal advice on Ukrainian and Canadian laws prior to making any arrangements.

The Russian military invasion of Ukraine has increased the risk of dangerous complications from childbirth. It has also changed legal and social opinions on international surrogacy and adoption. Attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure could disrupt medical services. Supply chain disruptions could limit the availability of essential medical supplies. You should consider the risk to your safety and the safety of a newborn before travelling to Ukraine.

You should consult with Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) on current policies regarding citizenship through descent, as well as on the issuance of Canadian travel documents.

Ukraine has strict laws on adoption, including criteria for prospective adopters. These laws may be different for Canadians holding Ukrainian citizenship.

The Embassy of Canada to Ukraine can’t provide recommendations on the selection of surrogacy or adoption agencies.

### Media

The Ukrainian Ministry of Defence must accredit all travel to Ukraine for media projects. You should consult the Ministry of Defence before you arrive in Ukraine to confirm their advice and regulations.

Expect a heavy police presence at Pride parades and certain 2SLGBTQI+ events. Counter-protests and violence are possible. Have a plan for safely exiting the area when participating in Pride parades or other 2SLGBTQI+ events.
