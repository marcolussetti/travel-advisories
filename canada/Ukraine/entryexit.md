# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

The authorities of a country or territory decide who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from Ukrainian authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond the date you expect to leave from Ukraine.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Foreign fighters

Foreigners who join the Ukrainian Armed Forces must sign a six-month contract with the Ukrainian Armed Forces and are not allowed to leave the country during this period.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Ukraine. In some cases, border authorities have refused to let dual citizens of Canada and Ukraine (both men and women) leave Ukraine on their Canadian passports.

If you were born in Ukraine and lived there after 1991, and have not renounced your Ukrainian citizenship, you are considered a Ukrainian citizen and must travel on a Ukrainian passport. Travelling on a foreign passport is a violation of local migration laws, and you may have to pay a fine.

Canadian citizens born to Ukrainian parents may unknowingly have Ukrainian citizenship. If you have family ties to Ukraine, you should contact the nearest Ukrainian embassy or consulate about potential citizenship obligations before travelling to Ukraine.

### Other entry requirements

Immigration officials may ask for proof of sufficient funds to cover your stay in Ukraine.

### Crimea and parts of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia Oblasts

Areas of Ukraine illegally occupied by Russia are active combat zones and all designated checkpoints for entry and exit to these areas are closed.

Ukrainian authorities will refuse entry to foreigners who attempt to enter Ukraine from Russia through Crimea or areas in Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts illegally occupied by Russia. You may be subject to arrest and detention for questioning to verify your identity. Entry to Ukraine from illegally occupied areas may be possible via specially organized humanitarian corridors or as a refugee.
