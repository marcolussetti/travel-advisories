## Safety and security

### Russian military invasion

On February 24, 2022, Russia began a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine, launching attacks across the country, including in major cities. In addition to military targets, Russia has and continues to attack Ukrainian civilian and government infrastructure in multiple cities, including Kyiv.

Heavy fighting is ongoing in several areas of the country. Bombardments, explosions and missile launches occur daily. The invasion has directly caused thousands of civilian casualties. There are basic supply shortages and essential services disruptions in areas close to the front lines. Strikes and bombardments could also pose a threat to Ukraine’s nuclear energy infrastructure, notably the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.

Ukrainian airspace is currently closed. The government of Ukraine has declared a state of emergency and imposed martial law, which gives local authorities broad powers to enforce security measures including:

* curfews
* security checks
* exit bans
* mandatory evacuation
* prohibition of assembly
* mandatory mobilization

The government of Ukraine decreed a full military mobilization. If local authorities consider you a citizen of Ukraine, you may be subject to military obligations and will likely be prevented from leaving the country.

Russian military action in Ukraine could further disrupt key infrastructure and transportation routes and limit the provision of essential services throughout the country.

Security conditions remain extremely unstable. Your safety is at high risk, particularly if you engage in active combat.

If you are in Ukraine, you should follow the instructions of local authorities at all times, including air raid warning sirens, curfews and evacuation orders.

If you are near military activity:

* review your personal security plans on a daily basis
* identify the location of the closest bomb shelter
* shelter in a hardened structure away from windows when air raid warning sirens are active

You should leave the country now if you can do so safely. If you choose to stay in Ukraine despite this advisory:

* maintain a supply of basic food, water and medications
* monitor trustworthy news sources to stay informed on the evolving situation
* ensure that your passport and other travel documents are secure at all times
* inform a family member or friend of your whereabouts
* register and update your contact information through the Registration of Canadians Abroad service and encourage other Canadian citizens in Ukraine to do so

Our ability to provide consular services in Ukraine is severely limited. You should not depend on the Government of Canada to help you leave the country.

If you are able to leave Ukraine safely:

* verify your destination’s entry requirements regularly
* expect highly congested routes, checkpoints and delays
* make sure to stop at all checkpoints and roadblocks, even if they appear unattended
* ensure that your passport and other travel documents are secure at all times
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary
* bring sufficient gasoline if you use your car

### Territories illegally occupied by Russia

The Russian Federation illegally occupied and annexed Crimea and holds strict control over the area. It also illegally occupies parts of the following oblasts:

* Donetsk
* Luhansk
* Kherson
* Zaporizhzhia

These areas are heavily militarized and intense fighting is ongoing. There are reports of war crimes and arbitrary detention of foreigners.

Due to the current situation, the Embassy of Canada to Ukraine in Kyiv has extremely limited access to consular clients. The Embassy of Canada to Russia in Moscow is only accredited to Russia and therefore cannot provide services in territories of Ukraine illegally occupied by Russia.

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing, occurs, particularly:

* in crowded places
* in tourist areas
* in bars and nightclubs
* on public transportation

In central Kyiv, criminal activity, including mugging, is more prevalent at night.

* Ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Avoid showing signs of affluence and carrying large sums of cash

Harassment and assaults can happen against individuals who act or appear as foreigners. Local authorities may not respond to racially motivated violence and harassment.

#### Violent crime

Armed robbery and violent outbursts can occur, especially in larger cities.

Weapons, including small arms and explosives, are present in all areas of the country. The number and accessibility of available weapons increased following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Criminal activity can be harder to track and is unpredictable because of the war. Violent outbursts rarely target tourists, but you could find yourself in the wrong place at the wrong time. Be aware of your surroundings and remain vigilant.

#### Women’s safety

Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse. Gender-based violence is on the rise in Ukraine.

Incidents of attacks and sexual assault, including rape, have been reported throughout the country, particularly in major cities.

* Avoid travelling alone, especially after dark
* Exercise caution on the street near bars and nightclubs
* Be careful when dealing with strangers or recent acquaintances, especially regarding the acceptance of rides or other invitations

Women or other survivors of gender-based violence may be discouraged or blocked from reporting aggressors to the authorities. If you are a survivor of a sexual assault or other crime, you should report it immediately to the police and the nearest Canadian office.

### Fraud

Credit and debit card as well as ATM fraud occurs. Be cautious when using credit or debit cards.

* Cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* Pay careful attention when others are handling your cards
* Avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* Use ATMs located in public areas or inside a bank or business
* Check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

#### Investment fraud

Unsolicited emails offering enticing business or financial opportunities are most likely fraudulent. Don’t travel to Ukraine with the intention to obtain restitution after losing money to a scam.

If you plan on buying property, or making other investments in Ukraine, seek legal advice in Canada and in Ukraine. Do so before making commitments. Related disputes could take time and be costly to resolve.

#### Scams

Scammers often target tourist areas and hotels.

Be aware of street scams. A common scam sees a person dropping a wallet or a bundle of money in front of a tourist, hoping the tourist will pick it up. The scammer then accuses the tourist of stealing some of the money. These scams can involve several criminals, sometimes posing as police officers. Don’t pick up the dropped items if you face this type of behaviour. Simply walk away without engaging in conversation.

#### Overcharging

Certain establishments, such as bars or nightclubs, may try to inflate your bill or charge you exorbitant prices.

Discussions about overcharging have turned violent. Tourists have been threatened and forced to pay the bill by the establishment's security guards.

* Always confirm the price of an item before ordering
* Do not leave an open bill
* Avoid giving your credit card to bar or restaurant staff
* Check your bill for accuracy before paying

#### Romance scams

Romance scams on dating sites or through social media have occurred. Be wary of online advertisements offering dating or marriage services in Ukraine. Do your research and verify the legitimacy of services before paying for anything.

* Beware of people who show a keen interest online
* Keep in mind that you may be the victim of a scam if you go to Ukraine to visit someone that you met online
* Always meet new acquaintances in a secure and familiar location
* Be mindful of the risk of inviting new acquaintances in your hotel room or apartment

### Spiked food and drinks

Snacks, beverages, gum and cigarettes may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

* Be wary of accepting these items from new acquaintances
* Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers

### Demonstrations

Mass gatherings, including demonstrations and protests, are prohibited under martial law.

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in Europe. Terrorists have carried out attacks in several European cities and further attacks are likely.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places. Be particularly vigilant if attending sporting events and during religious holidays and other public celebrations, as terrorists have used such occasions to mount attacks.

### Chornobyl

Following a disaster at the Chornobyl nuclear power plant in 1986, an exclusion zone of 30 km was established by local authorities which includes the cities of Prypiat and Chornobyl. The exclusion zone remains radioactive. Access to this zone is strictly restricted and must be arranged through a specialized tour operator. Anyone visiting Chornobyl must follow the safety instructions issued by the State Agency of Ukraine on Exclusion Zone Management.

### Road safety

Travel by road can be hazardous. Drivers do not always respect traffic laws. They may drive at excessive speeds and be reckless. Pedestrians and cyclists should be particularly careful.

Avoid driving at night outside major cities. Limited road visibility, poor vehicle maintenance and intoxicated drivers pose hazards.

While roadside services such as repair facilities exist, they are frequently inadequate.

#### Road conditions

Most roads outside major cities are poorly maintained. Some roads and bridges may be unusable or damaged by fighting from the Russian military invasion. Drivers experiencing elevated stress and fatigue due to road damage and unpredictable conditions may be aggressive or confrontational. Ensure that your vehicle doors are locked and windows are closed at all times

### Public transportation

Kyiv has a reliable metro system. Buses, however, are usually overcrowded and in poor condition.

Public transportation services and infrastructure across the country are susceptible to short- and long-term interruptions due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

#### Taxis

At public transportation hubs, order a taxi from a designated taxi booth within the arrivals terminal or use a trusted ride-sharing app. Do the same in the city instead of hailing a taxi on the street. Negotiate fares in advance to avoid excessive fares.

#### Trains

There is a risk of robbery and muggings on trains, particularly in overnight sleeper cars

* Be aware of your surroundings
* Store personal belongings and travel documents in a safe place
* Don’t leave the compartment unattended
* Ensure that the door is secured from the inside

### Air travel

Ukrainian airspace is closed.
