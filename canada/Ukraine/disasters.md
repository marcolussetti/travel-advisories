## Natural disasters and climate

### Climate change

Climate change is affecting Ukraine. Extreme and unusual weather events are becoming more frequent and may affect your travel plans. Monitor local news to stay informed on the current situation.

### Wildfires

Brush and forest fires are common in eastern and southern Ukraine in July and August. In case of a major fire, stay away from the affected area. Air quality in areas near active fires may deteriorate due to heavy smoke.

* Always follow the instructions of local emergency services personnel
* Monitor local media for up-to-date information on the situation

### Flooding

Flooding occurs in western Ukraine during the spring thaw and following sustained heavy rains. This may cause damage to roads and infrastructure. Plan your route carefully.

#### Burst dams

There is significant damage to Ukraineâ€™s civil infrastructure due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In 2023, dams faced attacks and sustained damages. Certain dams were destroyed, including the Nova Kakhovka dam in Kherson.

Following the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam, many towns and settlements in Kherson, Dnipro, and Zaporizhzhia face long-term impacts from flooding. Unexploded ordnance flowed downriver and into flooded areas. Local authorities have issued boil-water advisories in certain areas due to the risk of water-borne illness.

There are severe disruptions to essential services. Many roads in the area are impassable or closed.

If you are in Kherson Oblast:

* follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders
* monitor local news and weather reports
* use only bottled water for drinking and cooking

### Snow and Ice Storms

In winter, avalanches, heavy snow and freezing rain pose a risk. They can make roads impassable and can cause power disruptions. These conditions can affect access to isolated areas, including to some tourist resorts. The conditions can also limit the ability of first responders to reach these areas in case of emergency.
