## Natural disasters and climate

### Climate change

Climate change is affecting Burkina Faso. Extreme and unusual weather events are becoming more frequent and may affect your travel plans. Monitor local media for the latest information.

### Rainy season and flooding

The rainy season extends from June to October. Seasonal flooding can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services, including in the capital, Ouagadougou. Mudslides and landslides may damage roads and bridges, which may quickly become impassable.

* Monitor local media for the latest updates, including road conditions
* Stay away from flooded areas
* Monitor weather reports
* Follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders

### Sand and dust storms

Sandstorms can occur at any time, particularly during the summer months in the south of the country. From November to May, the Harmattan, a wind blowing from the Sahara, brings sand and dust.

During a dust storm:

* stay indoors
* keep windows closed
* be prepared to change, interrupt, or cancel your trip at any time
* monitor local media to stay informed about the situation
