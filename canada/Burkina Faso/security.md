# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Political situation

Two coups d’état occurred in Burkina Faso in 2022. The situation remains unstable and could deteriorate rapidly.

If you are in Burkina Faso:

* remain vigilant
* monitor local media to stay informed on the evolving situation
* follow the instructions of local authorities

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism. There have been multiple attacks in Ouagadougou and elsewhere in the country, including against foreign interests.

The terrorist threat as well as the risk of banditry and kidnapping are especially high in Burkina Faso’s border regions.

Further attacks cannot be ruled out. Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* extraction sites
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when you are in public places. Be particularly vigilant during:

* sporting events
* religious holidays
* public celebrations
* major political events, such as elections

Terrorists may use such occasions to mount attacks.

### State of emergency

There is a state of emergency in 8 regions:

* Boucle du Mouhoun
* Cascades
* Center North
* Center-East
* East
* Hauts-Bassins
* North
* Sahel

Local authorities periodically declare a state of emergency in various regions due to terrorism threats.

When a state of emergency is in effect, security forces have increased rights to:

* impose curfews and restrict movement without notice
* conduct searches
* proceed with seizures
* detain persons of interest

Some civil rights may be suspended, including the right to protest and to hold large meetings.

If you are travelling in a region where a state of emergency is in effect:

* be aware that you may be subject to searches by security forces
* always cooperate with military and police officers
* carry valid ID at all times and be prepared for various checkpoints
* allow extra time to reach your destination
* follow the instructions of local authorities
* monitor local news to stay informed on the current situation

### Kidnapping

Kidnappings occur regularly. The threat varies according to the regions, however it’s especially high in the border areas with Niger and Mali. Kidnappers have targeted foreigners.

If you plan to travel to Burkina Faso despite the risks:

* be vigilant at all times
* use varied and unpredictable routes and itineraries
* travel only in a convoy of at least two vehicles for long trips
* use an armed security escort
* if you are threatened, don’t resist

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations take place from time to time. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Banditry

Incidents of illegal roadblocks and carjacking have occurred. Armed criminals don’t hesitate to shoot at vehicles to stop and rob their occupants. The following regions are particularly prone to such incidents:

* eastern
* central
* east-central
* north-central
* central plateau

However, such incidents can also happen in other areas, day or night, on both main and secondary roads.

* Exercise caution at all times
* If possible, travel in a convoy
* Avoid travelling during early morning hours and after sundown
* In the event that you are attacked, don’t resist and contact the local authorities as soon as possible (Gendarmerie – numéro vert 10 10)

### Crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs in major cities. In Ouagadougou, the areas around the United Nations roundabout and Central Market are often targeted by thieves. Petty crime occurs to a lesser degree elsewhere in the country.

* Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Avoid showing signs of affluence and walking alone after dark
* Always carry a legally certified photocopy of your passport’s identification page

### Road safety

Driving in Burkina Faso can be challenging. Roads are generally narrow, unpaved and poorly lit. Pedestrians, bicycles, carts, vehicles without headlights and potholes pose hazards to drivers. Many trucks transit the country at night. Travel after dark is not recommended.

### Public transportation

Public transportation is not recommended.

### Air travel

We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.
