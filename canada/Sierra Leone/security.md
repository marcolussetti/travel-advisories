# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Political situation

On November 26, 2023, there were violent clashes between security forces and armed groups in Freetown. The situation is currently stable, but tensions remain. Further clashes or civil unrest cannot be ruled out.

### Border areas

Border areas are not well patrolled by local authorities. Border areas with Guinea and Liberia experience ongoing territorial disputes, trans-border military operations, and militia and criminal activities. Border raids may occur and could result in armed confrontations and other violent incidents. Land border crossings may close with little notice.

Be vigilant in all border areas, as the security situation could deteriorate suddenly

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs frequently across the country, and has recently increased reportedly due to the rise in drug use. These incidents particularly occur in busy areas, particularly in Freetown, especially in these areas:

* Eastern Freetown
* Lumley roundabout
* Lumley Beach at night

During your trip:

* keep your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, in a secure place
* don’t show signs of affluence or wear expensive jewellery
* don’t carry large sums of cash or valuables unnecessarily

#### Violent crime

Although incidents are mostly opportunistic, violent crime remains a concern. Armed robberies, carjackings and burglaries have occurred in foreigner’s homes. There is a heightened risk of serious crime after dark.

During your stay:

* avoid going out after dark
* avoid isolated areas
* keep doors and windows locked at all times
* avoid confrontation
* don't resist an attack

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations occur occasionally. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Terrorism

Sierra Leone has not been targeted by terrorist groups recently, but the country remains vulnerable to terrorist groups active in neighbouring countries. Terrorist attacks cannot be ruled out.

Targets could include:

* government buildings
* schools
* places of worship
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

Be particularly vigilant during:

* sporting events
* religious holidays
* public celebrations
* major political events, such as election

Terrorists may use such occasions to mount attacks.

### Road

#### Road safety

There are major road safety issues in Sierra Leone. Fatal accidents are common and they often involve pedestrians. Police and emergency services assistance is limited or even unavailable in rural areas.

#### Road conditions

Road conditions vary throughout the country. Freetown has paved roads and the main roads from Freetown to Makeni or Bo are paved. Most secondary roads are not paved. Driving conditions may be hazardous during the rainy season from April to November, and sometimes near-zero visibility is a risk. In Freetown, steep slopes can be a cause of accidents for poorly maintained cars that are unable to properly brake.

Driving can be dangerous due to:

* poorly maintained vehicles
* poorly maintained road and potholes
* stray livestock
* lack of traffic signs
* pedestrians on the road
* insufficient lighting and vehicles not using their headlights

#### Driving habits

Drivers do not always respect traffic laws. Speeding is common, especially on the Waterloo-Freetown highway. Pedestrians and other drivers’ right of way are not respected. Drinking and driving is common.

Traffic accidents can quickly draw large and sometimes hostile crowds. Remain calm if there is a dispute, particularly in a public place. If threatened by a large crowd, seek direct intervention from the local police.

If you choose to drive in Sierra Leone:

* always keep doors and windows closed and locked
* always carry a cellphone and charger
* always keep a full tank of gas
* avoid travelling after dark outside of Freetown
* outside Freetown a four-wheel-drive vehicle is recommended, particularly during the rainy season
* consider renting a car with a hired driver rather than driving yourself
* keep a supply of water and non-perishable snacks

#### Checkpoints

Police checkpoints are common throughout the country. Only national police officers in uniform have the authority to establish checkpoints.

* Be prepared to show your identification
* Follow the instructions of the police
* Remain calm and courteous

Children and road repair crews often establish unofficial roadblocks to ask for change.

### Women safety

Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment or verbal abuse.

### Fraud

#### Cybersecurity

Cybercrime and online extortion can occur in Sierra Leone.

Cybercriminals can compromise public Wi-Fi networks to steal personal data or credit information.

* Use secure public Wi-Fi networks
* Be cautious when posting information or photos on social media
* Keep in mind that you may be the victim of a scam if you go to meet an online acquaintance in person
* Be wary of unsolicited emails offering attractive business opportunities
* Don't click on suspicious links that ask for your banking information in an e-mail or text message

#### Credit card and ATM fraud

Credit and debit card as well as ATM fraud occurs sometimes.

When using your debit or credit card:

* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* pay careful attention when others are handling your cards
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* use ATMs located in public areas or inside a bank or business
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

### Tourist facilities

Tourist facilities are extremely limited and availability may be reduced during the holiday season. When possible, check the level of security at hotels, lodges or any other type of accommodation before booking your stay.

In remote regions, tourist facilities are almost non-existent.

If you are planning a trip outside Freetown:

* plan your trip in advance
* keep a supply of water, food, fuel and an emergency kit on hand
* bring a cell phone, charger and local emergency numbers
* make sure to have sufficient cash
* use a reputable tour operator

### Public transportation

Public transportation services are limited and not reliable.

You should avoid using public transportation.

#### Transportation between Lungi International Airport and Freetown

Local transportation services between Lungi International Airport and Freetown are available by:

* land
* ferryboat
* helicopter
* speed boat

None of those options are risk-free, and the risk increases after dark.

If you choose to use public transportation to and from the airport:

* plan to land early enough in the day so that you can arrive at your destination before nightfall
* arrange for transportation prior to arrival, reputable hotels often offer shuttle services from the boat dock to the hotel
* only use reputable taxi companies, including water taxi operators
* avoid using unregulated or unauthorized boats
* avoid using water transportation during rough seas
* be aware of your surroundings if you use the ferry, as there are reports of pickpocketing

### Telecommunications

The telecommunications network can be unreliable, especially in remote areas.

### Shortages

Water and fuel shortages occur occasionally.

* Keep a supply of water, fuel and an emergency kit on hand
* Monitor local media for the latest information

#### Power outages

Power outages occur regularly throughout the country, including in Freetown.

Power outages often impact essential services, such as:

* the public water supply
* telecommunications

### Water activities

Ocean currents along the coast are powerful and dangerous. There are no rescue services.

#### Swimming

Beaches are generally unsupervised. Several drownings occur every year. Follow the instructions of local authorities.
