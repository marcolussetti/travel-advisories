### Pre-travel vaccines and medications

When travelling in this destination, you might be at risk for diseases that can be prevented with vaccines or medications. Talk to a travel health care provider about which ones are right for you based on your travel plans.

The highlights below will also tell you if your destination may require that vaccine for entering or exiting.

Hepatitis A

There is a risk of [hepatitis A](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/hepatitis-a.html) in this destination. It is a disease of the liver. People can get hepatitis A if they ingest contaminated food or water, eat foods prepared by an infectious person, or if they have close physical contact (such as oral-anal sex) with an infectious person, although casual contact among people does not spread the virus.

Practise [safe food and water precautions](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/food-water) and wash your hands often. Vaccination is recommended for all travellers to areas where hepatitis A is present.

Yellow Fever - Country Entry Requirements 

[Yellow fever](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/yellow-fever.html) is a disease caused by a flavivirus from the bite of an infected mosquito.

Travellers get vaccinated either because it is required to enter a country or because it is recommended for their protection.

**Risk**

* There is a risk of yellow fever in this country.

**Country Entry Requirement\***

* Proof of yellow fever vaccination for travellers from all countries.

**Recommendation**

* Vaccination is recommended.
* Contact a designated [Yellow Fever Vaccination Centre](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/travel-health/yellow-fever.html#select-centre) well in advance of their trip to arrange for vaccination.
* Discuss travel plans, activities, and destinations with a health care professional.

\* It is important to note that [country entry requirements](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/vaccination-requirements-and-recommendations-for-international-travellers-and-malaria-situation-per-country-2022-edition "Link to External Site") may not reflect your risk of yellow fever at your destination. It is recommended that you contact the nearest [diplomatic or consular office](http://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?view=d "Link to External Site") of the destination(s) you will be visiting to verify any additional entry requirements.

Measles 

Measles is a serious viral infection that spreads easily. It spreads through the air, and can stay in the air for up to 2 hours. You can also get measles by direct contact with an infected person or by touching a surface with the virus on it and then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth before washing your hands.

Getting vaccinated is the best way to protect yourself and others from measles. In Canada, the measles vaccine is part of the routine immunization schedule. If you’re unsure whether you’re protected, talk to a healthcare provider.

Hepatitis B

[Hepatitis B](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/hepatitis-b.html) is a risk in every destination. It is a viral liver disease that is easily transmitted from one person to another through exposure to blood and body fluids containing the hepatitis B virus.  Travellers who may be exposed to blood or other bodily fluids (e.g., through sexual contact, medical treatment, sharing needles, tattooing, acupuncture or occupational exposure) are at higher risk of getting hepatitis B.

Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all travellers. [Prevent hepatitis B](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/hepatitis-b/prevention-risks.html#a2) infection by practicing safe sex, only using new and sterile drug equipment, and only getting tattoos and piercings in settings that follow public health regulations and standards.

Malaria 

[Malaria](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/malaria.html) is a serious and sometimes fatal disease that is caused by parasites spread through the bites of mosquitoes.

**Malaria is a risk to travellers to this destination.**  
   
[Antimalarial medication is recommended](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/catmat/appendix-1-malaria-risk-recommended-chemoprophylaxis-geographic-area.html) for most travellers to this destination and should be taken as recommended. Consult a health care professional or visit a travel health clinic before travelling to discuss your options. It is recommended to do this 6 weeks before travel, however, it is still a good idea any time before leaving.   
   
[Protect yourself from mosquito bites](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/insect-bite-prevention.html) at all times:

* Cover your skin and use an [approved](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/about-pesticides/insect-repellents.html) insect repellent on uncovered skin.
* Exclude mosquitoes from your living area with screening and/or closed, well-sealed doors and windows.
* Use insecticide-treated bed nets if mosquitoes cannot be excluded from your living area.
* Wear permethrin-treated clothing.

 If you develop [symptoms](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/malaria/symptoms-malaria.html) similar to malaria when you are travelling or up to a year after you return home, see a health care professional immediately. Tell them where you have been travelling or living.

Rabies 

In this destination, [rabies](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/diseases/rabies) is commonly carried by dogs and some wildlife, including bats. Rabies is a deadly disease that spreads to humans primarily through bites or scratches from an infected animal. While travelling, take [precautions](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/rabies/prevention.html), including keeping your distance from animals (including free-roaming dogs), and closely supervising children.

If you are bitten or scratched by a dog or other animal while travelling, immediately wash the wound with soap and clean water and see a health care professional. **In this destination, rabies treatment may be limited or may not be available, therefore you may need to return to Canada for treatment.**

Before travel, discuss rabies vaccination with a health care professional. It may be recommended for travellers who are at high risk of exposure (e.g., occupational risk such as veterinarians and wildlife workers, children, adventure travellers and spelunkers, and others in close contact with animals).

Polio 

[Polio](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/diseases/polio) (poliomyelitis) is an infectious disease that can be prevented by vaccination. It is caused by poliovirus type 1, 2 or 3. Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus 2 (cVDPV2) is present in this country.

Polio is spread from person to person and through contaminated food and water. Infection with the polio virus can cause paralysis and death in individuals of any age who are not immune.

**Recommendations:**

* Be sure that your polio vaccinations are up to date before travelling. Polio is part of the [routine vaccine schedule](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-1-key-immunization-information/page-13-recommended-immunization-schedules.html#p1c12a2) for children in Canada.
* One booster dose of the polio vaccine is recommended as an [adult](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-3-vaccination-specific-populations/page-9-immunization-travellers.html#a3).
COVID-19

COVID-19 is an infectious viral disease. Most of the time, it spreads when people are in close contact with others who are infected with the virus. It spreads through respiratory particles, or through an infected surface or object.

Vaccination is one of the most important ways to protect yourself from developing serious complications from COVID-19. Talk to a healthcare provider about the COVID-19 vaccine before travelling. Evidence shows that the COVID-19 vaccines used in Canada are very effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19.

In addition to vaccination, use personal protective measures to help protect yourself and others.

### Safe food and water precautions

Eating or drinking unsafe food or water, or swimming in contaminated water can make you sick while travelling. Take precautions by following these tips:

* Boil it, cook it, peel it, or leave it (only eat food that is prepared safely)
* Avoid, if possible, getting water in your eyes, mouth, or nose when swimming in freshwater (like streams, lakes, or canals), especially after heavy rain or flooding - the water might look clean but can still be contaminated
* Don’t swallow water when bathing, showering, swimming in pools, or using hot tubs

[Eat and drink safely abroad](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/food-water)

Cholera

**Risk**

[Cholera](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/cholera.html) is a risk in parts of this country. Most travellers are at very low risk.

To protect against cholera, all travellers should practise [safe food and water precautions](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/food-water).

Travellers at higher risk of getting cholera include those:

* visiting, working or living in areas with limited access to safe food, water and proper sanitation
* visiting areas where outbreaks are occurring

Vaccination may be recommended for high-risk travellers, and should be discussed with a health care professional.

Travellers' diarrhea

[Travellers' diarrhea](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/diarrhea.html) is the most common illness affecting travellers. It is spread from eating or drinking contaminated food or water.

Risk of developing travellers' diarrhea increases when travelling in regions with poor standards of hygiene and sanitation. Practise safe food and water precautions.

The most important treatment for travellers' diarrhea is rehydration (drinking lots of fluids). Carry oral rehydration salts when travelling.

Typhoid 

[Typhoid](http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/diseases/typhoid) is a bacterial infection spread by contaminated food or water. Risk is higher among children, travellers going to rural areas, travellers visiting friends and relatives or those travelling for a long period of time.

Travellers visiting regions with a risk of typhoid, especially those exposed to places with poor sanitation, should speak to a health care professional about vaccination.

Schistosomiasis

There is a risk of [schistosomiasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/schistosomiasis) in this destination. Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by tiny worms (blood flukes) which can be found in freshwater (lakes, rivers, ponds, and wetlands). The worms can break the skin, and their eggs can cause stomach pain, diarrhea, flu-like symptoms, or urinary problems. Schistosomiasis mostly affects underdeveloped and rural communities, particularly agricultural and fishing communities.

Most travellers are at low risk. Travellers should avoid contact with untreated freshwater such as lakes, rivers, and ponds (e.g., swimming, bathing, wading, ingesting). There is no vaccine or medication available to prevent infection.

### Tick and insect bite prevention

Many diseases are spread by bites from infected ticks and insects like mosquitoes, fleas, or flies. Before you travel, find out what types of ticks or insects are in the area, when they’re most active, and what diseases they can spread.

To protect yourself from bites:

* use an approved bug spray (insect repellent) on exposed skin
* wear light-coloured, loose clothing made of tightly woven materials like nylon or polyester
* wear socks and closed-toe shoes
* sleep under mosquito netting if you’re outdoors or staying in places that aren’t fully enclosed
* do a full body tick check on yourself, your children, your gear, and any pets you’re travelling with when you return from outdoor activities

Chikungunya

There is a risk of chikungunya in this country. The level of risk may vary by:

* season
* year
* region
* elevation

The virus that causes chikungunya is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. It can cause fever and pain in the joints. In some cases, the joint pain can be severe and last for months or years.

Protect yourself from mosquito bites at all times.

[Insect bite and pest prevention](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/insect-bite-prevention.html)

A vaccine for the prevention of chikungunya (IXCHIQ) is approved in Canada. Talk to your healthcare provider about how best to prevent chikungunya, including the benefits and risks of vaccination based on factors such as your age, itinerary and personal preferences.

### Animal precautions

Some infections can spread directly from animals to people, like rabies or bird flu (avian influenza). Others don’t spread directly from animals but can infect people who visit areas animals have contaminated with their droppings or body fluids.

Certain activities can increase your chances of coming into contact with animals, their droppings, or their body fluids, like:

* travelling in rural or forested areas
* camping, hiking, or visiting caves
* visiting places where live animals are sold or killed for food, like wet markets

To reduce your risk of getting sick:

* avoid contact with animals like stray dogs, livestock (such as pigs and cows), monkeys, snakes, rodents, birds, and bats.
* stay away from places where animal waste can build up, such as caves
* avoid eating undercooked meat

Make sure to closely watch children; they are more likely to try to touch animals.

Lassa fever 

Lassa fever is a risk in this country.

Lassa fever is caused by a virus carried by rodents. Humans get sick when they inhale or come into close contact with feces, saliva, or urine of infected rodents or the blood or bodily fluids of infected humans.

Lassa virus can be very serious. Avoid rodents and rodent-infested areas.

Mpox

[Mpox (monkeypox)](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/mpox.html) is a risk in this country. It is a viral disease that can cause serious illness in some circumstances. Risk is generally low for most travellers.

Mpox spreads in 3 ways:

* from animals to humans through direct contact or by eating or preparing undercooked meat of infected animals or coming into contact with an infected animal's body fluids

* from person to person through close contact, including direct contact with the skin lesions, blood, body fluids, or mucosal surfaces (such as eyes, mouth, throat, genitalia, anus, or rectum) of an infected person

* through direct contact with contaminated objects such as bedding and towels, or by sharing personal objects used by an infected person

Follow recommended [public health measures](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/monkeypox/risks.html#a3)and avoid contact with animals such as rodents and primates to help prevent getting or spreading the infection.

### Person-to-person infections

When travelling, you can reduce your risk of getting or spreading respiratory infections, like the flu or COVID-19, by:

* staying at your accommodation and limiting contact with others if you’re sick
* wearing a well-fitting mask, especially:   
  + if you’re sick and need to be around others
  + when you’re at large indoor events or in crowded settings, like sporting events, concerts, and airports
* cleaning your hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or using hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol
* covering your coughs and sneezes with a tissue or your elbow, not your hands

Tuberculosis

[Tuberculosis](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/tuberculosis.html) is an infection caused by bacteria and usually affects the lungs.

For most travellers the risk of tuberculosis is low.

Travellers who may be at high risk while travelling in regions with risk of tuberculosis should discuss pre- and post-travel options with a health care professional.

High-risk travellers include those visiting or working in prisons, refugee camps, homeless shelters, or hospitals, or travellers visiting friends and relatives.

### Medical services and facilities

Medical facilities are extremely limited and only offer basic services.

Ambulance services are available, but access could be limited.

In the event of a serious illness or accident, medical evacuation will be necessary. Medical transport is very expensive and payment is often required up front.
