## Natural disasters and climate

### Climate change

Climate change is affecting the Marshall Islands. Extreme and unusual weather events are becoming more frequent and may affect your travel plans. Monitor local news to stay informed on the current situation.

### Monsoon

The rainy (or monsoon) season extends from July to November. Severe rainstorms can cause flooding and landslides, resulting in significant loss of life, extensive damage to infrastructure, and disruptions in the provision of essential services.

### Typhoons

Typhoons usually occur between July and November. During this period, even small tropical storms can quickly develop into major typhoons.

These severe storms can put you at risk and hamper the provision of essential services.

If you decide to travel to a coastal area during the typhoon season:

* be prepared to change your travel plans on short notice, including cutting short or cancelling your trip
* stay informed of the latest regional weather forecasts
* carry emergency contact information for your airline or tour operator
