### Tourist facilities

Tourist facilities and services are limited. There are a few hotels on Majuro and Ebeye islands.

Plan your trip to minimize safety risks.

### Road safety

There is one paved road on Majuro Island, with no traffic lights and only a few traffic signs. Seasonal flooding can hamper overland travel.

* Be cautious when driving after dark
* Be careful of animals roaming the streets

### Public transportation

Majuro has an affordable shared taxi system. Minivan taxis also circulate on the main road.
