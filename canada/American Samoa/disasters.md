## Natural disasters and climate

### Climate change

Climate change is affecting American Samoa. Extreme and unusual weather events are becoming more frequent and may affect your travel plans. Monitor local media for the latest information.

### Earthquakes and tsunamis

American Samoa is located in an active seismic zone. Earthquakes occur frequently.

A tsunami can occur within minutes of a nearby earthquake and can travel long distances across the Pacific. However, the risk of a tsunami can remain for several hours following the first tremor.

If you’re staying on the coast, familiarize yourself with the region’s evacuation plans in the event of a tsunami warning.

### Rainy and cyclone seasons

The rainy season extends from October to May and the cyclone season in the South Pacific extends from November to April.

Severe rainstorms can cause flooding and landslides. Seasonal flooding can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable and infrastructure damaged. Disruptions to air services and water and power supplies may also occur.

* Monitor local media for the latest information, including on road conditions
* Stay away from flooded areas
* Monitor weather reports
* Follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders

During a cyclone, hotel guests may be required to leave accommodations near the shore and move to safety centres inland. Travel to and from outer islands may be disrupted for some days.
