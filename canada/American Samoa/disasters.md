## Natural disasters and climate

### Seismic activity

American Samoa is prone to earthquakes. A tsunami can occur within minutes of a nearby earthquake and can travel long distances across the Pacific.

* If staying in accommodations on the coast, familiarize yourself with the regionâ€™s evacuation plans in the event of a tsunami warning

### Rainy and cyclone season

The rainy and cyclone seasons in the South Pacific extend from November to April.

Severe rainstorms can cause flooding and landslides. Flooding and landslides have resulted in significant loss of life and extensive damage to infrastructure. These events hamper the provision of essential services. Disruptions to air services and to water and power supplies may also occur.

* Keep informed of regional weather forecasts
* Avoid disaster areas
* Follow the instructions of local authorities

During a cyclone, hotel guests may be required to leave accommodations near the shore and move to safety centres inland. Travel to and from outer islands may be disrupted for some days.
