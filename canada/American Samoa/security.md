# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Crime

The crime rate is low in American Samoa. However, petty crime occurs sometimes.

* Keep your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, in a secure place
* Avoid walking alone after dark
* Avoid deserted areas at night

### Swimming

Tidal changes can cause powerful currents in the many coastal lagoons around the islands. Fatal swimming accidents can occur.

* Consult residents and tour operators for information on possible hazards, the presence of dangerous species and safe swimming areas
* Respect the areas reserved for swimming
* Monitor weather conditions
* Follow the instructions and warnings of local authorities

### Power outages and water shortages

Power outages and water shortages occur occasionally, especially during and after cyclones.

Local authorities may limit electricity usage and impose water rationing measures.

Power outages and rationing could impact essential services, such as:

* transportation
* power distribution
* water and food supply
* telecommunications networks
* emergency services
* medical care
* banking transactions
* the supply of basic necessities

Not all buildings are equipped with generators and drinking water may be difficult to find.

* Keep a supply of water, food, fuel and an emergency kit on hand
* Monitor local media for the latest information

### General safety information

Don’t approach or feed stray dogs, which can become aggressive.

### Roads

#### Road safety

Fatal accidents are frequent. Speed limits are low. Make sure you respect them.

#### Road conditions

Road conditions are generally good but may vary throughout the territory.

Rapidly changing weather conditions, such as heavy rains and strong winds, can pose a hazard.

Driving can also be dangerous, especially in rural areas, due to:

* insufficient lighting
* unpaved roads
* potholes and uneven surfaces
* poorly maintained roads
* lack of traffic signs
* pedestrians and animals on the road
* narrow, winding and mountainous roads

If you choose to drive in American Samoa:

* always drive defensively
* avoid driving at night outside of urban areas
* plan your trip in advance, especially if you are visiting a rural area

### Public transportation

There is no public transportation on the Manu’a Islands.

#### Buses

“Aiga buses,” or family buses, are available on Tutuila. They do not have a set schedule, but they generally operate from early morning to 5 pm Monday through Friday, have a reduced schedule on Saturday, and are closed on Sunday. You can flag them down anywhere along the main road by waving at the driver and can be dropped off anywhere that’s safe to pull over.

#### Taxis

Taxis are available on Tutuila. Fares are government-regulated, so they aren’t metered.

* Confirm the fare in advance
* Have small bills available for payment
