## Safety and security

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as purse snatching and pickpocketing, occurs. Thieves could target tourists, particularly in crowded public areas such as:

* markets, particularly those of Valletta and Marsaxlokk
* public transportation hubs and facilities, particularly the main bus routes between Valletta Paceville, San Ġiljan and Sliema (lines 13, 14, 15, 16)
* hotel lobbies
* beaches
* bars and nightclub areas of Paceville, San Ġiljan and Sliema
* restaurants, patios and outdoor cafés
* tourist sites and attractions

While travelling:

* ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times

* pay attention to your surroundings, particularly in crowded and tourist areas
* be wary of unsolicited offers or advice from strangers

#### Violent crime

Although violent crime is rare, physical attacks, including sexual assault and rape, do occur.

Be particularly vigilant in nightlife areas such as Paceville, where excessive alcohol consumption and large crowds can sometimes lead to disagreements and confrontations.

### Spiked food and drinks

Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

### Fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud occurs. When using debit or credit cards:

* pay careful attention when others are handling your cards
* use ATMs located in public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature

* Avoid using public Wi-Fi networks
* Avoid making purchases on unsecured websites
* Use sound judgment when posting information on social media
* Be particularly vigilant when contacting or meeting individuals known over the internet
* Never click on suspicious links asking for your banking information in an email or text message

#### Rentals agencies

There are reports of apartment rental scams and difficulties when seeking reimbursement for a security deposit. When dealing with apartment or car rental agencies:

* only rent from reputable companies
* read the rental contract thoroughly
* request an inventory of the furniture

There is a threat of terrorism in Europe. Terrorist attacks have occurred in a number of European cities. Terrorist attacks could occur at any time.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools

### Water activities

#### Swimming

Many beaches in Malta are supervised and enforce excellent safety procedures.

The main warning flags used in Malta are:

* Green: calm waters, you can swim
* Yellow: agitated waters, swim with caution
* Red: dangerous waters, don’t swim
* Blue/violet: contaminated waters or presence of dangerous species, don’t swim

Tidal changes and strong winds can cause hazardous currents and riptides.

Coral, urchin, jellyfish and other aquatic life found along the coasts can poison, sting or cause infection if touched or stepped on.

* Always obey warning flags at beaches
* Ask local authorities about the presence of dangerous species and immediately seek medical assistance if you get hurt
* Wear reef shoes to protect yourself against stone and coral cuts or urchin stings
* Keep a safe distance from boats and restricted areas
* Avoid visiting beaches or coastal areas during periods of severe weather warnings
* Look out for signs warning of cliff erosion and falling rocks
* Don’t dive into unknown waters, as hidden rocks or shallow depths can cause serious injury or death
* Exercise caution and follow the advice of the local authorities

#### Recreational boating

If you are planning to go boating:

* know the capacity of your boat
* know and respect the navigation rules
* follow safe practices for all activities on the water
* keep a safe distance from areas reserved for certain activities such as snorkeling
* carry a marine radio that will generate your position in case of emergency
* be prepared for emergencies

### Hunting season

Specific dates for the hunting season are determined by the government in the lead-up to the season. It generally runs from the spring until the fall.

If you travel to rural areas during this period:

* make yourself aware of hunting areas
* remain in designated camping areas
* don't wander onto private property where hunting is legally permitted

### Road safety

Traffic drives on the left.

Road conditions vary across the country. Narrow, winding, congested and sometimes poorly maintained roads may pose hazards. Heavy rains regularly cause flash-flooding.

Drivers may not respect traffic laws or follow safe driving practices. They may not always yield to pedestrians or bicycles. While illegal, double parking is common.

### Public transportation

A bus system connects the main cities. Buses are reliable but are sometimes overcrowded, particularly during summer months. You can use the Tallinja official app to confirm the routes and schedules.

#### Ferries

There are ferries connecting:

* Cirkewwa and the island of Gozo
* Valletta and Sliema
* Valletta and Cospicua
* Valletta and the island of Gozo
* Valletta and Pozzallo, Sicily, Italy

Weather conditions can lead to cancellations or delays, particularly on ferry lines to and from Gozo.

* Pay attention to pre-departure notices from your carrier
* Always reconfirm departure schedule before heading to the port
