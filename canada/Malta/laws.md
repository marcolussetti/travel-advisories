## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Judicial proceedings

Judicial proceedings are usually lengthy in Malta due to long pretrial investigative periods. If you are involved in judicial proceedings in Malta, be aware that:

* you may be subject to lengthy detention periods before your trial
* you may be denied bail
* obtaining free legal aid can be complex and slow down the process
* unpredictable delays may occur before trial and between hearings

### Transfer to a Canadian prison

Canada and Malta are signatories to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in Malta to request a transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both Canadian and Malta authorities.

This process can take a long time, and there is no guarantee that the transfer will be approved by either or both sides.

### Identification

Authorities may request to see your ID at any time.

* Carry valid identification or a photocopy of it at all times
* Keep a photocopy of your passport in case it’s lost or seized

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect lengthy prison sentences and heavy fines.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Malta.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Malta, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Malta.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Malta, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Maltese court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Malta to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.
