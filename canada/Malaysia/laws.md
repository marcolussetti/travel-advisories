## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Laws

Some aspects of Shari’a (Islamic) law have been introduced in Malaysia. Muslim travellers may be subject to these laws. In some states, such as Kelantan and Terengganu, particularly strict regulations on alcohol and public decency can be applied.

Religious preaching to Muslims, including distributing non-Islamic religious materials, is illegal.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can face the death penalty. Possession of as little as 15 grams of some prohibited substances will be considered trafficking.

### Identification

You must carry photo identification, such as your passport. Keep a photocopy of your passport in a safe place, in case it’s lost or confiscated.

### Driving

Traffic drives on the left.

Canadian driver’s licenses are valid in Malaysia and can be used locally for a period of 3 months. After this time, you can either drive with an international driving permit, or apply for a Malaysian driver’s license at a certified driving institute.

Seat belts are mandatory. Penalties for drinking and driving are severe. Convicted offenders can expect fines or imprisonment and could have their driver's licence suspended or revoked.

The use of cellular phones while driving is prohibited.

It is common to receive on the spot fines for disobeying traffic laws.

### Marine transportation

Foreign vessels travelling in the waters off Sabah are subject to Malaysian law and must use routes designated by Malaysian authorities. Vessels must also fly both a Malaysian flag and the flag of their home country.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

The laws of Malaysia prohibit sexual acts between individuals of the same sex, and transgender individuals have been arrested. 2SLGBTQI+ persons should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Malaysia.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Malaysia.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of Malaysia, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Malaysia.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Malaysia by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Malaysia to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Culture

The majority of the population is Muslim. Dress conservatively, behave discreetly and avoid discussions on race or religion.

### Ramadan

In 2025, the lunar month of Ramadan is expected to begin on or around February 28.

In public, between sunrise and sunset, be discreet when:

* drinking
* eating
* smoking

### Money

The currency is the ringgit (MYR).

Some major hotels don’t accept credit cards. ATMs are readily available across the country.

A special permit is required to bring in more than US$10,000 in the form of cash or other negotiable items. Without the permit, excess amounts are seized upon arrival. Visitors may leave the country with only the amount of currency declared on the Traveller’s Declaration Form on arrival.
