# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

The authorities of a country or territory decide who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Malaysian authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country's entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond the date you expect to leave Malaysia.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

You should also be aware that current systems used by some countries and travel companies may not recognize the “X” gender identifier. You may still be asked to provide your sex/gender information as either male or female when travelling.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

A special visa is available to individuals who participate in the Malaysia My Second Home or Mm2h program.

### Other entry requirements

There is an increase in online scams related to the Malaysia Digital Arrival Card (MDAC).

* The MDAC is a free service
* Do not use any website that charges fees for arrival cards
* Only use the official website to apply for an MDAC

You must complete a Malaysia Digital Arrival Card (MDAC). This is an online pre-arrival form and can be filled in up to three days prior to your arrival in Malaysia.

First time visitors to Malaysia need to go to immigration upon arrival. You must present your passport and a complete MDAC for border officers to validate before leaving the immigration counter.

Canadian travellers can use the e-gate facilities to enter and exit Malaysia.

### Employment pass

Before you apply for an employment pass (at an immigration office or a Malaysian high commission overseas), your prospective employer must apply for approval from the Standing Committee for Malaysianisation or the Malaysian Industrial Development Authority to fill the position with an expatriate. While waiting for the approval, your employer can apply to bring you into the country on a social visit pass (for example, temporary employment). We strongly recommend against this last step: you should obtain your employment pass before arrival because it is very difficult to change visa status once in Malaysia. Foreigners are limited to three visit pass extensions, after which they must leave the country or a fine will be imposed for overstaying.

### Biometrics

Foreigners are required to register their biometrics (fingerprints) at their port of entry. Children under 12 years of age and diplomats accredited to Malaysia are exempt from this process.

### Screening measures

Malaysian authorities have implemented screening measures in response to various virus outbreaks. Travellers entering Malaysia from Canada may be subject to a body temperature check. In some cases, travellers may be isolated and treated.

### Drug screening

Custom officers can subject you to a drug screening test at the point of entry to Malaysia. If you test positive for drugs, you can be arrested and prosecuted, even if the drugs were consumed prior to your arrival in the country.
