## Natural disasters and climate

### Climate change

Climate change is affecting Malaysia. Extreme and unusual weather events are becoming more frequent and may affect your travel plans. Monitor local media for the latest information.

### Monsoon season

The rainy (or monsoon) season extends from November to March. Severe rainstorms have occasionally caused flooding and landslides, resulting in loss of life and damage to infrastructure. Seasonal flooding can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable and bridges damaged.
