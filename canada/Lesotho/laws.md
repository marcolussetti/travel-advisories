### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Lesotho law doesn’t criminalize sexual acts or relationships between individuals of the same sex. However, Lesotho doesn’t recognise same-sex marriages or civil unions.

2SLGBTQI+ persons could be discriminated based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or sex characteristics.

### Identification

Local authorities may ask to check your identity at any time.

* Carry identification documents at all times
* Keep a certified photocopy of your passport in a safe place, in case it is lost or confiscated

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Lesotho.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Lesotho, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Lesotho.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Lesotho by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Lesotho to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.
