# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs and is prevalent in urban areas.

* Be cautious when out in public places, especially at night
* Ensure that your belongings, including your passport, are secure at all times
* Keep valuables with you in your carry-on when travelling and ensure it is secure at all times
* Stay in hotels or accommodations offering good security measures

#### Violent crime

Violent crime, such as armed robbery and residential break-ins, occurs and often targets foreigners. Hotspots include:

* popular restaurants
* local hotels
* the business district
* poorly lit or unlit roads

Crime is most prevalent in urban areas such as:

* Maseru
* Leribe
* Maputsoe

However, incidents have occurred in remote mountainous areas as well.

Carjacking also occurs.

* Don’t drive after dark
* Always lock windows and doors
* Don’t offer rides to hitchhikers
* Be vigilant when stopping at scenic points or rest stations
* Park in well-lit areas
* There is no visible police presence at night. Remain vigilant at all times
* Exercise increased caution in urban centres
* Don’t walk alone, especially at night
* If attacked or robbed, do not resist

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety can vary greatly throughout the country.

The roads in the capital, Maseru, are adequate, as well as the roads leading to the airport and industrial areas. The roads leading to the Lesotho–South Africa border crossings and most of Lesotho’s district capitals are also in good condition. Aggressive and unpredictable local driving habits pose a risk in Maseru.

The roads linking rural communities are gravel and poorly maintained.  They are poorly lit, and wandering livestock pose a risk to drivers. Some of these rural communities, mainly those in the mountainous areas, are only connected by dirt roads.  You may need a four-wheel drive vehicle in those areas. You must also have such a vehicle to enter and depart Lesotho through the Sani Pass on the eastern border.

Tourist facilities are limited in Lesotho. There are few gas stations outside of cities and large towns, and no roadside assistance services operating throughout the country.

Weather conditions can change rapidly in mountainous regions. Even in the summer, it can become cold unexpectedly.

* Plan your travel accordingly
* Always carry a cell phone and charger
* Carry a blanket, warm clothes and a flashlight in case of snowfall or vehicle breakdown in mountain areas
* Contact the Lesotho Mounted Police Service in case of road emergencies

### Public transportation

#### Bus and taxis

Although public bus and taxi services exist, poor vehicle maintenance, overcrowding and lack of driver training make them unsafe. Accidents occur regularly.

The best way to travel is by private car.

### Renting a car

Car rental services are available in Maseru. If you rent a car in South Africa, you may bring it into Lesotho with a letter of authorization from the rental company.

Check with the rental company to make sure they issue letters of authorization.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations take place from time to time. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Hiking and camping

Although hiking is a popular activity in Lesotho, there are no set hiking trails.

Given the country’s high altitude, mountaintop campsites will expose you to extreme weather, such as thunderstorms. Unpredictable rainfall can lead to flash floods in the valleys and flooding around rivers. Choose your campsite wisely. There is no reliable mountain rescue service in Lesotho.

If you intend to hike:

* never do so alone and always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* ensure that you’re properly equipped and well informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary, including when you expect to be back to camp
* know the symptoms of high-altitude illnesses, which can be fatal

### Women’s Safety

Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse.
