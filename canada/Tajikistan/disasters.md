## Natural disasters and climate

### Climate change

Climate change is affecting Tajikistan. Extreme and unusual weather events are becoming more frequent and may affect your travel plans. Monitor local media for the latest information.

### Earthquakes

Tajikistan is located in an active seismic zone. There have been no major incidents in recent years, but minor tremors occur frequently and could trigger mudflows and landslides.

### Avalanches

There is a risk of avalanches in mountainous regions, especially following heavy snowfalls.

The risk is particularly high in the:

* Pamir Mountains in the GBAO
* Sughd region
* Districts of Republican Subordination

In 2023, a powerful avalanche hit the city of Khorog in the GBAO, causing several casualties and significant damage to buildings and infrastructure.

You should monitor avalanche forecasts and local media if youâ€™re travelling to mountainous areas.

### Rainy season

In Tajikistan, the rainy season usually extends from January to May and from October to December. Rainfall is rare during summer months.

Seasonal flooding occurs due to heavy rainfall and the melting of snow and ice, and can result in severe mudflows and landslides. They can cause significant damage to buildings and infrastructure.

There is a higher risk of mudflows and landslides in the following areas:

* the Khatlon province
* the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast (GBAO)

Seasonal flooding can affect overland travel and the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable and infrastructure damaged.

* Monitor local media for the latest information, including on road conditions
* Stay away from flooded areas
* Monitor weather reports
* Follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders
