# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Border areas

In March 2025, Tajik, Uzbek and Kyrgyz authorities reached an agreement on the delimitation of their shared borders. Despite the agreement, tensions could arise during and after the delimitation process.

It may be difficult to find the border’s exact location and some border crossings with neighbouring countries are not clearly identified.

If you travel to areas near the border with Afghanistan despite the advisory in effect, you should remain vigilant as the security situation is volatile, unpredictable and the area difficult to access.

Borders may close without notice.

#### Afghanistan

The land border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan has been closed since the Taliban takeover in 2021. Despite military patrols on the Tajik side, in 2023, armed clashes between militants from Afghanistan and Tajik border guards resulted in casualties.

#### Kyrgyzstan

The security situation at the border between Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan has improved. However, while limited cross-border travel is now possible, some checkpoints remain closed or restricted. Travellers may be subject to specific entry procedures and permit requirements.

In September 2022, violent clashes due to territorial disputes broke out at the border between the Sughd region of Tajikistan and the Batken region of Kyrgyzstan, including near the Vorukh enclave. The clashes resulted in numerous casualties, including civilians.

#### Uzbekistan

In 2020, Uzbekistan announced the completion of a demining operation along its border with Tajikistan.

Although no incidents have been reported since, landmines still pose a safety risk.

### The Gorno Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast (GBAO)

You need pre-authorization from the Tajik government to travel to the GBAO.

Political tensions between the local population of GBAO and Tajikistan’s central government have led to civil unrest, violent clashes, mass arrests and casualties.

In 2022, Tajik authorities strongly repressed demonstrations in GBAO and shut down the Internet and other means of communication while significantly increasing military and police presence in the region.

GBAO is also prone to religious extremism, drug trafficking and terrorism due to its shared border with the Afghan province of Badakhshan.

### Landmines

Landmines pose a risk to travellers. Marked and unmarked minefields may still be present in border areas of the following countries, particularly in uncontrolled areas:

* Afghanistan
* Kyrgyzstan
* Uzbekistan

If you travel to these areas despite the advisory in effect:

* stay on main roads and paved surfaces
* avoid roadside ditches, shoulders and unmarked trails
* cross only at official border crossings
* pay attention to signs indicating the possible presence of landmines

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and mugging, occurs. Thieves target tourists.

Theft usually occurs in crowded public areas such as:

* popular tourist areas, including lookouts
* buses and trains
* bus and train stations and airports
* hotel lobbies
* restaurants, including outdoor seating areas

During your trip:

* keep your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, in a secure place
* don’t show signs of affluence or wear expensive jewellery
* don’t carry large sums of cash or valuables unnecessarily
* be aware of your surroundings, especially in busy tourist areas
* make sure your passport and other travel documents are up to date

#### Violent crime

Violent crime against foreigners rarely occurs. However, there have been reports of attacks, muggings and robberies.

#### Organized crime

Organized crime associated with international drug trafficking occurs in Tajikistan, especially in border areas. Tajikistan is a transit country for drugs. Illicit drug trafficking and use may lead to violence and street crime.

Local police may not offer the level of assistance you may be used to in Canada.

* Exercise caution
* Avoid areas that seem unsafe, including border areas
* Don’t walk alone at night
* Choose accommodations that provide adequate security
* Keep windows and doors locked at all times

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism.

Terrorist groups operate in Tajikistan and in the region. Attacks are rare and mostly target government buildings, including law enforcement and military facilities. However, you could be at the wrong place at the wrong time.

Terrorist attacks could occur at any time.

Targets could include:

* government buildings and military installations
* schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

Be particularly vigilant during:

* sporting events
* religious holidays
* public celebrations
* major political events, such as elections

Terrorists may use such occasions to mount attacks.

### Women’s safety

Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse. Women should travel in groups and during daylight.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

2SLGBTQI+ persons are discriminated against based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression or sex characteristics. Incitement to violence and attacks on 2SLGBTQI+ persons occur.

There are reports of psychological and physical abuse, extortion and blackmailing of 2SLGBTQI+ persons, including by police officers. Public displays of affection between same-sex individuals may lead to physical and verbal abuse.

Even though Tajik law doesn’t criminalize sexual acts between individuals of the same sex, 2SLGBTQI+ persons should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Tajikistan.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations may occur. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Outages

Power outages occur regularly, including during winter months, and last for several hours. Rural areas are the most affected, but there have also been outages in Dushanbe.

Power outages could impact essential services, such as:

* medical services
* public water supplies
* telecommunications
* banking transactions

The outages can affect the heating of buildings in winter and the supply of drinking water due to freezing temperatures.

They may also lead to long lines at grocery stores, gas stations and pharmacies. If you travel to Tajikistan, plan accordingly and keep a supply of water, food and fuel on hand.

### Adventure tourism

Outdoor activities, such as trekking, can be dangerous, especially if they are not well-organized. Trails are not always marked and weather conditions can change rapidly. There is a higher risk of mudslides and landslides in the spring due to the melting of snow and ice.

Tour operators may not meet Canadian safety standards. You should book your travel through an accredited travel agency who will register you with the Committee of Emergency Situations and Civil Defence.

If you intend to participate in adventure tourism activities:

* never do so alone, and do not part with your tour companions
* consider hiring an experienced guide from a reputable company
* obtain detailed information on your activity and the environment in which you will be setting out
* buy travel insurance that covers incidents related to this type of recreational activity
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to tackle the challenges of your activity
* refrain from using equipment if you are unsure of its condition or safety
* Make sure you always have access to an emergency kit

### Public transportation

Public transportation is unreliable and limited, especially train and bus services.

#### Taxis

Licensed and unlicensed taxis operate in Tajikistan, but it’s difficult to differentiate them. Drivers don’t always use official meters.

Avoid using shared taxis called "marshrutka." Drivers are reckless and are often involved in accidents. The vehicles are overcrowded and not always equipped with seatbelts. Petty crimes, such as theft, occur, and drivers may overcharge you.

If you choose to take a taxi during your stay:

* order it at the reception if you are staying at a hotel
* don’t use unmarked taxis
* never share a taxi with strangers
* confirm the fare in advance
* have small bills available for payment

### Road safety

#### Road conditions

Roads are generally in good condition in and around Dushanbe.

In rural areas, particularly in mountainous areas, they are poorly maintained and dangerous due to:

* large potholes
* uneven and unpaved surface
* malfunctioning or missing traffic lights
* insufficient lighting
* inadequate road markings and signage

During winter months, roads are dangerous and may only be accessible to 4-wheel-drive vehicles. They may close unexpectedly due to avalanches and/or heavy snowfall, rockslides, and mudslides, especially in the Pamir mountains. A tunnel links Dushanbe and Khujand, but this road is particularly dangerous in the winter due to icy conditions.

Emergency services may take a long time to reach remote areas. Gas stations are limited and the quality of fuel is poor in rural areas.

#### Driving habits

Drivers often disregard traffic laws, including:

* sudden lane changes without signaling
* driving on the opposite side of the road and in-between lanes
* stopping abruptly

Pedestrians often cross in the middle of the road and drivers don’t always give pedestrians the right of way.

Police frequently stop drivers to verify their identification.

If you’re driving in Tajikistan:

* always drive defensively
* avoid driving at night
* use main roads and highways as much as possible
* always carry a cellphone and a charger
