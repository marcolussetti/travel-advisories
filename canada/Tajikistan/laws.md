### Identification

You should always carry a copy of your passport. Individuals are frequently required by the police to produce identification.

* Keep a photocopy of your passport and your visa in a safe place in case it’s lost or seized
* Keep a digital copy of your identification and travel documents

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Tajik law doesn’t criminalize sexual acts between individuals of the same sex. However, 2SLGBTQI+ persons could be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or sex characteristics.

2SLGBTQI+ persons should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Tajikistan.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Tajikistan.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of Tajikistan, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

### Mandatory military service

Male Tajik citizens between the ages of 18 and 27 are subject to mandatory military service.

Canadians with Tajik citizenship may be subject to national obligations, including military service. If you have dual Canadian-Tajik citizenship, local authorities may force you to complete your military service. You should check your status with the nearest embassy or consulate of Tajikistan before travelling.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Tajikistan.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Tajikistan by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Tajikistan to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Dress and behaviour

Tajikistan is a secular country. However, Islamic practices and beliefs are adhered to, particularly in rural areas.

To avoid offending local sensitivities:

* dress conservatively
* behave discreetly
* respect religious and social traditions

### Money

The currency of Tajikistan is the Tajik Somoni (TJS), which is used for most transactions.

The economy is primarily cash-based. Credit cards are not widely accepted, except in larger hotels, restaurants and cafés in larger cities. You can exchange money, especially U.S. dollars, at exchange bureaus or at any bank or major hotel.

There are ATMs in Dushanbe, but some may not accept international cards and run out of money. In rural areas, ATMs are not as prevalent.

#### Currency declaration

There are no restrictions on the amount of foreign currency you can import. However, you must declare any foreign currency equivalent to more than $3,000 USD.

It is prohibited to export local currencies.

Foreign currency declarations apply to any monetary instruments.
