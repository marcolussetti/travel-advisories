## Safety and security

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and bag snatching, occurs, especially on public transport. Thieves target tourists.

Theft, including car theft and theft from cars, occurs, particularly in crowded public areas such as:

* popular tourist areas, including lookouts
* buses, trains, bus and train stations, and airports
* hotel lobbies
* restaurants, bars and night clubs, including outdoor seating areas.

During your trip:

* keep your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, in a secure place
* do not show signs of affluence or wear expensive jewellery
* do not carry large sums of cash or valuables unnecessarily
* avoid isolated areas
* avoid walking alone after dark
* be aware of your surroundings, especially in busy tourist areas

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in Europe. Terrorist attacks have occurred in a number of European cities. There is a potential for other violent incidents.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

Be particularly vigilant during:

* sporting events
* religious holidays
* public celebrations

Terrorists may use such occasions to mount attacks.

### Fraud

When using your debit or credit card:

* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN

* use ATMs located in public areas or inside a bank or business
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

* Use your own USB adaptor or carry an extra battery pack
* Use secure public Wi-Fi networks

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations occur and in most cases are announced in advance. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Spiked food, drinks and other items

Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers, especially at night clubs, music festivals and mass gatherings. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

### Roads

#### Road conditions

Roads are generally in good condition, but lanes are not always clearly marked.

Travelling in rural areas can be dangerous due to:

* heavy agricultural vehicles
* bicycles and vehicles travelling without taillights or reflectors
* insufficient lighting

#### Driving habits

Drivers can be aggressive.

### Public transportation

#### Taxis

Only use reputable taxi companies through establishments such as hotels or taxi apps.

If you do call for a taxi or hail one from the street, confirm the fare and ask for a receipt in advance.
