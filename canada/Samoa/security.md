### Water activities

#### Swimming

Lifeguards don’t usually supervise beaches. Tidal changes can cause powerful currents in the many coastal lagoons that surround the islands. Riptides are common. Several drownings occur each year.

Rescue services may not be consistent with international standards.

* Consult local residents and tour operators for information on possible hazards and safe swimming areas
* Follow the instructions and warnings of local authorities

#### Diving

Tour operators may not adhere to international standards.

If you undertake adventure sports, such as diving:

* choose a well-established and reputable company that has insurance
* ensure that your travel insurance covers the recreational activities you choose

In doubt concerning the safety of the installation or equipment, don’t use them.

### Stray animals

Stray dogs are common throughout the islands.

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety can vary greatly throughout the islands. Main roads on the islands of Upolu and Savai’i are paved but are poorly maintained. Street signs are rare.

Drivers don’t respect traffic laws.

Driving conditions may be hazardous during the rainy season, particularly on roads that traverse streams.

* Avoid driving after dark
* Be particularly vigilant during the rainy season

Taxis are generally safe. Some drivers may overcharge their clients.

* Use only officially marked taxis
* Negotiate fares in advance or insist that the driver use the meter

#### Ferries

There is a ferry service between Upolu and Savai’i. Ferry accidents may occur due to the overloading and poor maintenance of some vessels.

Don’t board vessels that appear overloaded or unseaworthy.
