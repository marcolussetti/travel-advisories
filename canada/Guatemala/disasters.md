## Natural disasters and climate

### Wildfires

Forest fires occur between November and June. They can happen throughout the country, but the Petén area is usually the most affected.

The air quality in areas near active fires may deteriorate due to heavy smoke.

In case of a major fire:

* stay away from affected areas, particularly if you suffer from respiratory ailments
* follow the advice of local emergency services personnel
* monitor local media for up-to-date information on the situation

### Hurricane season

Hurricanes usually occur from mid-May to the end of November. During this period, even small tropical storms can quickly develop into major hurricanes.

These severe storms can put you at risk and hamper the provision of essential services. You could face serious safety risks during a hurricane. You should carefully consider these risks when planning a trip during hurricane season.

If you decide to travel to a coastal area during the hurricane season despite the risks:

* be prepared to change your travel plans on short notice, including cutting short or cancelling your trip
* stay informed of the latest regional weather forecasts
* carry emergency contact information for your airline or tour operator
* follow the advice and instructions of local authorities

### Seismic activity

#### Earthquakes and tsunamis

Guatemala is located in an active seismic zone. Earthquakes and tsunamis can occur.

A tsunami can occur within minutes of a nearby earthquake. However, the risk of tsunami can remain for several hours following the first tremor. If you’re staying on the coast, familiarize yourself with the region’s evacuation plans in the event of a tsunami warning.

#### Volcanoes

There are four active volcanoes in Guatemala.

Eruptions may occur at any time. Series of tremors sometimes lead to evacuations of surrounding areas. Falling ash may also disrupt flights at La Aurora International Airport.

In the event of an earthquake or volcanic eruption:

* monitor local media to stay informed of the evolving situation
* follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders
