## Safety and security

### Crime

#### Violent crime

Violent crime, including homicides, is common in Guatemala. Due to a lack of resources within the police force, arrest and detention rates are quite low. There have been incidents involving deceptive police officers who commit petty crimes, while other officers have reportedly been involved in sexual assault cases.

Most incidents are drug- and gang-related. They occur throughout the country, including in tourist destinations. Travellers have been attacked when visiting volcanoes and other tourist sites. Rifles and handguns are very common.

Criminals perceive foreigners as wealthy. As a result, travellers are often victims of robbery and carjacking. They have also been subject to armed assault and sexual assault, including rape.

Incidents of armed robbery occur daily on public buses. Buses are frequently targeted by gangs, who may hurl grenades or fire shots as a way of ensuring compliance with their demands or to settle accounts. Criminals have attacked drivers, fare collectors and passengers.

Due to very high levels of violent crime, you should avoid non-essential travel to certain:

* zones in Guatemala City
* municipalities in Guatemala and Escuintla departments
* departments along the borders with El Salvador and Honduras
* highways throughout the country

Crimes that occur in these areas include:

* murders
* kidnappings
* sexual assaults

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, is prevalent in urban and tourist areas, especially in:

* markets
* national parks
* volcanoes
* other crowded places

Crime tends to increase during the holiday seasons.

Schemes often involve some form of distraction. Criminals frequently operate in groups and, increasingly, on motorcycles. Typically, two men on a motorcycle accost a pedestrian or driver stuck in traffic and demand valuables.

Some criminals also pose as police officers. They may tell you they are drug enforcement officers and then take you to a side road where they steal everything from you. Victims who have resisted have been injured or killed.

If travelling to Guatemala:

* don’t display signs of affluence, especially upon arrival at the airport, where travellers have been followed and robbed or carjacked en route to Guatemala City and Antigua
* keep laptop computers, mobile phones and other personal electronic devices out of sight, and refrain from using them in public
* ensure that your belongings, including passports and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* carry only a copy of the identification page of your passport and enough money for the day
* if threatened by robbers, do not resist: hand over your valuables and cash immediately

#### Express kidnappings

Express kidnappings have occurred. The kidnappers usually force their victims to withdraw funds from an ATM or to arrange for family or friends to pay the ransom. Criminal taxi drivers often use this ploy. They first pick up the victim and then stop to pick up associates.

* Be cautious of strangers
* Avoid travelling alone, especially at night
* Avoid isolated areas and secondary roads
* Avoid low-cost hotels with poor security
* Avoid excessive alcohol and narcotic consumption, as it can make you a more vulnerable target for criminals

### Border areas

Border areas often see higher levels of criminal activity and violence. Crime rates are high near all border crossings in Guatemala, but are worse near unofficial ones.

Drug-related armed attacks occur in departments close to all borders. The southwestern department of San Marcos at the Guatemala-Mexico border and the zone at the border with Belize are especially affected.

There is a heightened security presence at the official Guatemala-Mexico border points due to increased migration flows. Military and police forces conduct random vehicle searches along all borders. Wait times may be long.

Many border posts close for lunch and at dusk.

* Travel only through official border crossings
* Allow enough time for border formalities
* Cross only during the daytime and allow enough time to reach your destination or a major city before dark

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Discrimination against 2SLGBTQI+ persons is common.

There have been violent attacks against 2SLGBTQI+ persons.

### Fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud occurs.

When using debit or credit cards:

* pay careful attention when others are handling your cards
* use ATMs located in public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations take place frequently. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

If you participate in demonstrations as a foreigner, you may face detention, deportation, and the denial of future entry into Guatemala.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for up-to-date information on the situation

### Vigilante justice

Vigilante justice has increased in rural areas, resulting in lynchings of suspected child abductors, extortionists and other criminals.

### Photography

Many people in Guatemala fear that children are being kidnapped for illegal adoption or sexual abuse. Photographing children and women, especially in areas with Indigenous presence, may result in exacerbating this fear. Violent incidents involving foreigners taking photos have occurred.

Avoid approaching or photographing children and women, especially in Indigenous communities.

### Women’s safety

Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse.

Incidents of sexual assault have also occurred, including on buses. Some tourist service-providers build trusting relationships with female tourists and then sexually assault them.

* Avoid travelling alone, with informal guides or with strangers, even if they appear friendly and helpful
* Use only reputable tour guides or buses
* Ensure the tour guide has a name tag with the name of the tour company

### Spiked food and drinks

The spiking of drinks is a problem in tourist areas, especially in Antigua. Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances, including taxi drivers. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

### Hiking

Mountain activities, such as hiking, can be dangerous, especially if they are not well-organized. Trails are not always marked and weather conditions can change rapidly, even in summer.

Some volcanoes are at high altitude, with sub-zero temperatures at night. Warm and waterproof attire is essential. Local tour companies might underestimate the risk of hypothermia.

There is no mountain rescue service in Guatemala.

If you intend on hiking, including on volcanoes:

* never do so alone and always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* ensure that you’re properly equipped
* stay informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary
* know the symptoms of high-altitude illnesses, which can be fatal
* obtain detailed information on hiking routes before setting out and do not venture off marked trails

### Water activities

Coastal waters can be dangerous. Riptides are common.

Not all beaches have lifeguards or warning flags.

* Exercise caution when swimming
* Don’t swim alone, after hours or outside marked areas
* Consult residents and tour operators for information on possible hazards and safe swimming areas
* Follow the instructions of local authorities

### Adventure travel

Tour operators may not adhere to international standards.

If you participate in adventure activities, such as zip-lining, diving and whitewater rafting:

* choose a well-established and reputable company that has insurance
* make sure safety equipment, such as helmets and life jackets, are available and in good condition
* make sure your travel insurance covers the recreational activities you choose
* avoid challenging rivers, such as the Cahabón, Los Esclavos, Nahualate and Naranjo rivers, if you don’t have previous rafting experience

If in doubt concerning the safety of the facilities or equipment, don’t use them.

### Road travel

#### Road conditions

Road safety and road conditions can vary greatly throughout the country. While most roads in urban areas are in fair condition, travel on secondary streets and rural roads can be hazardous due to:

* poor maintenance and lighting
* poorly maintained vehicles
* lack of road signs
* pedestrians on the road
* steep and winding mountain roads
* mudslides and rock slides during the rainy season, which can also affect main highways in mountainous regions

#### Road safety

Local drivers generally don’t respect traffic laws. They are often reckless. Driving under the influence of alcohol is also common.

There is heavy traffic on:

* the Pan-American Highway (CA-1)
* the road from Guatemala City to the Atlantic Ocean (CA-9)

Police presence is scarce on:

* the isolated dirt roads near Lake Atitlan
* the road from Godínez to Panajachel

Seek advice from a registered travel agency if you plan off-road travel in the remote highlands of Petén to ensure you’re prepared and properly equipped.

#### Roadblocks

Roadblocks erected because of roadwork are common, particularly in the following northern and western departments:

* Alta Verapaz
* Escuintla
* Huehuetenango
* Petén
* Quiché
* San Marcos

These roadblocks may cause substantial delays.

Illegal roadblocks are also frequent. They can occur on the main roads leading to Guatemala City’s La Aurora International Airport.

Throughout Guatemala:

* avoid travelling at night
* drive with car windows closed and doors locked at all times
* be prepared to change your travel plans in case of roadblocks
* don’t go through roadblocks without stopping, even if they appear unattended

PROVIAL, the government roadside assistance agency, patrols most of the major highways and provides updates on roads conditions.

### Public transportation

#### Buses

Local public buses, known as “chicken buses”, are not safe. Most of the time, they are recycled school buses mechanically unreliable. They are often overcrowded. Unlicensed drivers often drive at excessive speeds. They are frequently involved in major road accidents, and serious crimes occur on board.

Avoid using chicken buses.

Privately owned bus lines, including Transmetro and Transurbano in Guatemala City, are safer, but passengers have been subject to attacks at stations. If you travel by bus:

* travel only during daylight hours
* make sure the transportation provider is reputable and reliable before booking
* confirm your drop-off location, because Guatemala City Council no longer allows some intercity buses to enter the city centre

#### Taxis

Hotel-associated taxis and yellow cabs (*taxis amarillos*), which operate in Guatemala City, are considered safe. White taxis operate independently and are considered dangerous. They have been involved in cases of extortion, petty theft and other crimes.

* Avoid boarding taxis at taxi stands or flagging taxis in the street
* Avoid using white taxis
* If using hotel taxis, request the service at the front desk and always look for the hotel logo on the car
* When travelling by air, pre-arrange your pickup with your hotel prior to your arrival or use authorized airport taxis
* Note the driver's name on the picture identification badges, as well as the licence number
* Never share a taxi with strangers
* Make sure the driver doesn’t pick up other passengers along the way to your destination
* Negotiate the fare in advance
* Have small bills available for payment

#### Ridesharing services

Several ridesharing services are also available but safety varies depending on the company.

Ridesharing services drivers are sometimes targets of taxi drivers who oppose these services. As a result, some may ask you to sit in the front seat to hide the fact that they are providing a rideshare service.

* Use ridesharing services from a trusted app only
* Confirm the driver’s identity and the licence plate before getting in the car

#### Tuk-tuks / rickshaw taxis / moto taxis

These two- or three-wheeled motorcycles with passenger cabins are unsafe. While they operate with taxi licences, they are not regulated and are frequently involved in accidents.

Avoid riding in tuk-tuks, rickshaw taxis or moto taxis.

### Boating

Illegal drug traders may operate vessels in Guatemalan waters. Boaters in the Rio Dulce area of Izabal have been the victim of violent armed attacks.

* Avoid boating at night
* Enter Guatemala only through official ports of entry staffed by Guatemalan immigration officers
* Use officially recognized docking and berthing facilities only
