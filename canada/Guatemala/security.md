# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Border areas

Border areas often see higher levels of criminal activity and violence. Crime rates are high near all border crossings in Guatemala but are worse near unofficial ones.

Drug-related armed attacks occur in all departments close to borders. The southwestern department of San Marcos at the Guatemala-Mexico border and the area near the border with Belize are especially affected.

There is a heightened security presence at the official Guatemala-Mexico border crossings due to increased migration flows. Military and police forces conduct random vehicle searches along all borders. Wait times can be long.

Many border crossings close for lunch and at dusk.

If you cross a land border:

* cross only at official borders crossings
* account for possible delays
* avoid travelling after dark
* always remain vigilant

### Crime

#### Violent crime

Violent crime occurs frequently throughout Guatemala. Incidents include:

* murders
* armed robberies
* kidnappings
* assaults, including sexual and physical assaults
* carjackings

While most crimes are drug- and gang-related, travellers have been attacked, sometimes at tourist sites. Criminals perceive foreigners as wealthy, making them targets of violent crime.

Some criminals also pose as police officers. They may tell you they are drug enforcement officers and then take you to a side road where they steal everything from you. Victims who have resisted have been injured or killed.

Due to a lack of resources within the police force, arrest and detention rates are quite low. There have been incidents involving police officers who commit petty crimes, while other officers have been linked to human trafficking and drugs.

During your stay:

* always be aware of your surroundings
* avoid walking in isolated areas after dark
* travel in groups
* avoid using your cell phone in public

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and bag snatching, occurs frequently, especially:

* in urban areas
* at markets
* at national parks
* around volcanoes
* close to airports

Petty crime tends to increase before, during and after celebrations.

Criminals are increasingly using distraction tactics and operating in groups, often on motorcycles. A common method involves two individuals on a motorcycle approaching pedestrians or drivers stopped in traffic to demand cash and valuables. These individuals may be armed with pistols or knives. If victims resist, there is a serious risk of injury, including being shot or stabbed.

During your trip:

* keep your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, in a secure place
* keep a digital copy of your identification and travel documents
* do not show signs of affluence or wear expensive jewellery, especially upon arrival at the airport, where travellers have been followed and robbed or carjacked en route to Guatemala City and Antigua
* do not carry large sums of cash or valuables unnecessarily
* do not resist an attack
* stay in accommodations with adequate security measures

### Express kidnappings

Express kidnappings occur occasionally.

Criminals kidnap the victim from the street or a taxi and force the person to withdraw funds from an ATM. The victim is sometimes held overnight so that a second withdrawal can be made the next day.

These kidnappings occur throughout the country and are often committed by organized criminals. They are sometimes committed by taxi drivers.

* Only use reputable taxi companies or ride-sharing applications
* Avoid hailing taxis on the street
* If you're threatened by armed criminals, stay calm and do not resist
* Do not accept rides from new acquaintances or strangers

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Acts of violence have been committed against 2SLGBTQI+ persons.

Avoid public displays of affection.

### Fraud

Credit and debit card as well as ATM fraud occurs.

When using your debit or credit card:

* pay careful attention when others are handling your cards
* use ATMs located inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements
* do not withdraw large sums of cash

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations occur frequently.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

If you participate in demonstrations as a foreigner, you may face detention, deportation and the denial of future entry into Guatemala.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Vigilante justice

Vigilante justice has increased in rural areas, resulting in lynchings of suspected child abductors, extortionists and other criminals.

### Photography

Many people in Guatemala fear that children are being kidnapped for illegal adoption or sexual abuse. Photographing children and women, especially in areas with Indigenous presence, may result in exacerbating this fear. There have been violent incidents involving foreigners taking photos.

Avoid approaching or photographing children and women, especially in Indigenous communities.

### Women’s safety

Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment or verbal abuse.

Sexual assaults have also occurred, including on buses. Some tourist service providers, including individuals posing as tour guides, build trusting relationships with female tourists and then sexually assault them.

* Avoid travelling alone, with informal guides or with strangers, even if they appear friendly and helpful
* Use only reputable tour guides or buses
* Ensure the tour guide has a name tag with the name of the tour company

### Spiked food, drinks and other items

Drink spiking is a problem in tourist areas, especially in Antigua. Never leave your food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances as these items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

### Adventure travel

Outdoor activities, such as hiking, climbing volcanoes, zip-lining, diving and whitewater rafting, can be dangerous.

Tour operators may not meet Canadian safety standards.

Some volcanoes are at high altitude, with sub-zero temperatures at night. Warm and waterproof attire is essential. Local tour companies might underestimate the risk of hypothermia.

There is no mountain rescue service in Guatemala.

If you intend to participate in adventure travel activities:

* stay on marked trails and consider hiring an experienced guide from a reputable company
* buy travel insurance that covers these types of recreational activities
* ensure that you have proper equipment and bring sufficient water
* stay informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to tackle the challenges of your activity
* be aware of the symptoms of altitude sickness, dehydration, and heatstroke, which can be fatal
* avoid challenging rivers, such as the Cahabón, Los Esclavos, Nahualate and Naranjo rivers, if you don’t have previous rafting experience

### Water activities

Coastal waters can be dangerous. Riptides are common.

Beaches are generally unsupervised, and most don’t have warning flags to alert swimmers of unsafe conditions.

* Respect the areas reserved for swimming
* Consult residents and tour operators for information on possible hazards, the presence of dangerous species and safe swimming areas
* Avoid beaches and coastal areas if the weather forecast is poor
* Follow the instructions of local authorities

### Roads

#### Road conditions

Road conditions vary throughout the country. While most roads in urban areas are in fair condition, travel on secondary and rural roads can be hazardous due to:

* insufficient lighting
* lack of traffic signs
* unmarked speed bumps
* poorly maintained vehicles
* pedestrians and animals on the road
* narrow, winding and mountainous roads
* heavy traffic, especially on the Pan-American Highway (CA-1)
* the road from Guatemala City to the Atlantic Ocean (CA-9)
* poorly maintained roads

Driving conditions may be hazardous during the rainy season due to flooding, mudslides and rockslides, which can also affect main highways in mountainous regions.

#### Road safety and driving habits

Drivers don’t always respect traffic laws. They can be aggressive and reckless. Drinking and driving is common.

Police presence is scarce on:

* the isolated dirt roads near Lake Atitlan
* the road from Godínez to Panajachel

Seek advice from a registered travel agency if you plan off-road travel in the remote highlands of Petén to ensure you’re prepared and properly equipped.

#### Roadblocks

Roadblocks erected because of roadwork are common, particularly in the following northern and western departments:

* Alta Verapaz
* Escuintla
* Huehuetenango
* Petén
* Quiché
* San Marcos

These roadblocks may cause substantial delays.

Illegal roadblocks are also frequent, including on the main roads leading to Guatemala City’s La Aurora International Airport.

If you choose to drive in Guatemala:

* always drive defensively
* avoid travelling after dark
* always keep doors and windows closed and locked
* be prepared to change your travel plans in case of roadblocks
* do not go through a roadblock without stopping, even if it appears unattended

PROVIAL, the government roadside assistance agency, patrols most of the major highways and provides updates on roads conditions.

### Public transportation

#### Buses

Avoid using local public buses, known as “chicken buses.”. Most of the time, they are recycled school buses that are mechanically unreliable and unsafe. They are often overcrowded. Unlicensed drivers often drive at excessive speeds. They are frequently involved in major road accidents, and incidents of armed robbery occur regularly on board. Buses are targeted by gangs, who may hurl grenades or fire shots as a way of ensuring compliance with their demands or to settle accounts. Criminals have attacked drivers, fare collectors and passengers.

Public bus lines such as Transmetro and Transurbano in Guatemala City are safer, but passengers have been attacked at stations. If you travel by bus:

* travel only during daylight hours
* make sure the transportation provider is reputable and reliable before booking
* confirm your drop-off location, because Guatemala City Council no longer allows some intercity buses to enter the city centre

#### Taxis

Hotel-associated taxis and yellow cabs (taxis amarillos), which operate in Guatemala City, are considered safe. White taxis are operated independently and are considered dangerous. Their drivers have been involved in cases of extortion, petty theft and other crimes.

* Avoid boarding taxis at taxi stands or flagging taxis in the street
* Ask for your taxi at the front desk if you’re using hotel services
* Arrange your pickup with your hotel before arrival when travelling by air or use authorized cabs at the airport
* Note the driver's name on their identification card and licence number
* Never share a taxi with stranger
* Negotiate the fare in advance
* Have small bills available for payment

#### Ride-sharing services

Several ride-sharing services are available.

Ride-sharing service drivers are sometimes targets of taxi drivers who oppose these services. As a result, some may ask you to sit in the front seat to hide the fact that they are providing a ride-share service.

If you use a ride-sharing application:

* confirm the driver’s identity and licence plate before getting in the car
* use the security features in the application

#### Tuk-tuks / rickshaw taxis / moto taxis

Avoid riding in these two- or three-wheeled motorcycles with passenger cabins, which are unsafe. While they operate with taxi licences, they are not regulated and are frequently involved in accidents.

### Boating

Illegal drug traders may operate vessels in Guatemalan waters. Boaters in the Rio Dulce area of Izabal have been victims of violent armed attacks.

If you are planning to go boating:

* avoid boating at night
* enter Guatemala only through official ports of entry staffed by Guatemalan immigration officers
* moor your boat only at a designated area
