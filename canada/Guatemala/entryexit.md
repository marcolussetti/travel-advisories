# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

The authorities of a country or territory decide who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Guatemalan authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country's entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond the date you expect to leave Guatemala.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

You should also be aware that current systems used by some countries and travel companies may not recognize the “X” gender identifier. You may still be asked to provide your sex/gender information as either male or female when travelling.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Entry stamp

When entering Guatemala, you must obtain an entry stamp in your passport.

If you fail to present your entry stamp when departing Guatemala, you may be fined and experience delays.

If you enter Guatemala with a vehicle, you must comply with the deadline for leaving the country, which is indicated on the temporary importation form provided by Guatemalan customs at the port of entry. If you fail to leave Guatemala with your vehicle by the expiry date, you will be subject to a fine for the extra days.

### Electronic declaration form

You must complete an electronic declaration form before arriving in Guatemala and before leaving. You will then receive a QR code. Keep a printed or electronic copy of your QR code to present to authorities upon your arrival or departure.

### Central America-4 Border Control Agreement (CA-4)

Under the terms of the Central America-4 Border Control Agreement (CA-4), Canadian tourists may travel freely within any of the following CA-4 countries:

* El Salvador
* Guatemala
* Honduras
* Nicaragua

You can travel between these countries for up to 90 days without having to undergo entry and exit formalities at border immigration checkpoints. However, 90 days are not automatically granted. The immigration officer at your first entry point into the CA-4 region will determine the exact length of your authorized stay.

You must still check in at immigration counters when you enter or exit these checkpoints.

Make sure you receive an entry or exit stamp in your passport each time you cross a checkpoint to avoid fines and problems with immigration authorities.

You may request an extension equal to the number of days you were initially authorized to stay . However, you must request this extension and pay the required fee at the Guatemalan Migration Institute before your first authorized stay expires. Immigration authorities will determine the exact length of the extension.

You are authorized to stay in Guatemala for a maximum of 180 days. However, if you receive an extension in another CA-4 country that leads to a total authorized stay of less than 180 days, you cannot request another extension in Guatemala. Likewise, if you receive an extension in another CA-4 country that leads to a total authorized stay of more than 180 days, Guatemala will only recognize the first 180 days.

Once your total authorized stay expires, you must either:

* change your migratory status
* leave the CA-4 region
* travel to El Salvador, where you may be granted a stay of up to 180 days

If you fail to do so, you will be fined and given 5 days to leave.

Once you leave the CA-4 region, you may attempt to return and restart the process, as long as 72 hours have passed since your exit. However, the immigration officer could deny your re-entry.

If you get a new Canadian passport in Guatemala, you must obtain a new entry stamp from immigration authorities before exiting the country and travelling within the CA-4 region.

Each CA-4 country interprets and enforces the agreement differently. Ensure you carefully read the Travel Advice and Advisories for each destination you plan on visiting before travelling.
