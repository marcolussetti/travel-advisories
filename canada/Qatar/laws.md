# Laws and culture

## Laws and culture

Qatari and Canadian criminal law systems are significantly different. Laws, penalties and legal procedures may vary.

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Legal process

Suspects and witnesses to incidents may be detained with limited or no access to legal counsel or consular officials for 3-5 days.

Qatari officials may issue a travel ban pending the resolution of the case. These processes can last up to several years.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect heavy fines and lengthy jail sentences.

#### Alcohol

The consumption of alcohol in public is illegal. Avoid drinking alcohol outside licensed premises.

### Ramadan

In 2025, the lunar month of Ramadan is expected to begin on or around February 28.

In public, between sunrise and sunset, refrain from:

* drinking
* eating
* smoking

### Religious proselytism

Religious proselytism is illegal.

Avoid engaging in religious activities that contradict or challenge Islamic teachings and values. This includes preaching, possessing, or distributing religious literature or material.

### Dress and behaviour

Qatar customs, laws and regulations adhere closely to Islamic practices and beliefs.

Public displays of affection, including holding hands and kissing, is not well socially accepted.

Foreign female travellers are not typically expected to wear head covers. However, revealing clothing is considered inappropriate.

To avoid offending local sensitivities:

* dress conservatively
* behave discreetly
* respect religious and social traditions
* seek permission from locals before photographing them

### Marriage

Common law partnership is illegal in Qatar. Men and women are not permitted to share a home unless they are legally married or are related to one another.

If you marry a Qatari citizen, the Qatari government may inform you that you have lost your Canadian citizenship. Foreign governments don't have the authority to strip you of your Canadian citizenship. If this occurs, contact the nearest Canadian government office as soon as possible.

Sexual relations outside of marriage are a criminal offence.

### Family law

Qatar family law is different from Canadian family law. Decisions are based on Islamic law.

Children of a Qatari father automatically acquire Qatari citizenship at birth. They must enter and leave the country on a Qatari passport.

If you are involved in a custody dispute in Qatar, consult a Qatari lawyer for advice and assistance regarding your own specific situation.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Qatar.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Qatar by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Qatar to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Identification

Local authorities may ask you to show identification at any time.

* Carry photo identification at all times.

You can drive in Qatar with your Canadian driver's license for up to 7 days.

You must carry an international driving permit if you plan to drive beyond 7 days in the country. New residents may use an International driving permit for a maximum of six months. In that period, you can convert it into a valid Qatari driving licence.

Driving laws are severe in Qatar. Local authorities strictly enforce them.

The country has a zero tolerance policy for drinking and driving.
