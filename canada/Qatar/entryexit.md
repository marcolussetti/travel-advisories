# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Qatari authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid at least 6 months beyond the date you expect to leave Qatar.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Residence and work permits

You must have both a residence and work permit to work in Qatar. To receive these permits, you must be sponsored by an employer.

While most employees are free to leave and enter Qatar, the employer controls the issuance of exit permits for essential employees. The employer may designate up to 5% of its employees as “essential.” If you are identified as an “essential employee”, you must obtain your employer's permission to exit Qatar, even for personal or emergency travel.

In the event of a contract or employment dispute, Qatari authorities refer to the Arabic language of a contract.

#### Entry bans

You could be denied entry into Qatar if your passport bore an Israeli visa, an Israeli border stamp or an Egyptian or Jordanian border stamp issued by an office bordering Israel.

#### Exit bans

Local authorities may prevent you from leaving Qatar if you have incurred loans and debts with a Qatari institution. You must be free of loans and debts to leave the country.

Similarly, a pending legal proceeding may cause authorities to issue a travel ban that would prevent you from leaving Qatar.

#### Health insurance

You must obtain a health insurance policy recognised by the Qatari Ministry of Public Health to enter Qatar. You can find the list of recognised insurance providers and purchase the insurance policy online.
