## Natural disasters and climate

High levels of humidity and severe heat occur from June to September.

### Dust storms

Sand and dust storms pose a risk as they reduce visibility and can cause respiratory illness. These storms can also disrupt air travel and road traffic.

### Drought and flooding

Qatar has been facing a water crisis in recent years, leading to drought and desertification. While infrequent, torrential rains and heavy flooding also occur in coastal areas.

In the event of flooding:

* avoid the affected area
* stay informed of the latest regional weather forecasts
* follow the instructions of local authorities

The rainy season extends from December to January. Seasonal flooding can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable and bridges damaged.
