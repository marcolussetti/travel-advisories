## Safety and security

### Tensions in the Middle East

Tensions can flare up suddenly in the Middle East, and lead to travel disruptions, including flight cancellations and airspace closures.

### Regional conflicts

Conflicts in the Middle East and the Gulf region could affect Qatar. Regional tensions can flare up at any time, resulting in an unpredictable and volatile security situation.

* Monitor the security situation
* Follow the instructions of local authorities

### Terrorism

There is a constant terrorist threat throughout the Arabian Peninsula. Reports of planned terrorist attacks occasionally emerge. Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Qatar.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

Be particularly vigilant during:

* sporting events
* religious holidays
* public celebrations
* major political events, such as elections

Terrorists may use such occasions to mount attacks.

### Crime

The crime rate is low and violence is rare. However, credit card fraud does take place. Ensure that personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

2SLGBTQI+ persons could be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression or sex characteristics.

* Beware of people who show a keen interest in you online
* Keep in mind that you could be the victim of a scam if you agree to meet with an online acquaintance
* Always meet new acquaintances in a secure and familiar location

If you are detained by local authorities due to your sexual orientation, gender identity or any other sexual characteristic, you should report it immediately to the Embassy of Canada in Doha.

Qatari law criminalizes sexual acts and relationships between persons of the same sex.

2SLGBTQI+ persons could also be discriminated against or detained based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or sex characteristics.

Those convicted can face:

* imprisonment
* corporal punishment
* fines

2SLGBTQI+ persons should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Qatar.

### Women’s safety

Although rare, women travellers may be subject to some forms of harassment, verbal abuse, or physical assaults. Local authorities’ response to reports of sexual violence may differ substantially from the Canadian context. Foreign women have been detained and accused of extramarital sex after reporting sexual assault.

* Avoid travelling alone after dark
* Be careful when dealing with strangers or recent acquaintances
* If you are the victim of a sexual assault, you should report it immediately to the nearest Government of Canada office

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations may occur. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Desert excursions

Desert excursions can be hazardous. Off-road driving should only be undertaken in a convoy of four-wheel drive vehicles with an experienced guide.

If engaging in desert expeditions or trekking:

* never do so alone
* always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company
* travel in a 4 x 4 vehicle
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* avoid venturing off marked trails
* ensure that you're properly equipped and well informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* carry sufficient water supply and pay attention to the symptoms of dehydration and heatstroke, both of which can be fatal
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary, including when you expect to be back
* obtain detailed information on each activity before setting out

### Road safety

#### Road conditions

Road conditions can vary greatly throughout the country. While the roads in Doha are generally in good condition, they are often over-crowded and commonly under construction. Outside of Doha, poorly lit roads and wandering livestock may pose a risk. Roads can be muddy during the winter rain season.

#### Driving safety

Traffic drives on the right.

Accidents causing fatalities are common and one of Qatar's leading causes of death. Drivers don't generally drive safely. They often drive at excessive speeds, are extremely aggressive and reckless. They don't respect traffic laws.

In case of an accident:

* move the vehicle to the nearest parking area if you can so do safely; you can be fined for blocking traffic
* call 999 and wait for the police to arrive

Leaving the scene is considered a criminal offence.

### Public transportation

#### Buses

A public bus system is available, though, it runs limited routes.

#### Taxis

Officially marked taxis are metered.

* Use officially marked taxis only
* Negotiate fares in advance, or insist that the driver use the meter
* Avoid taking shared taxis
* Never enter a cab if it already has one or more passengers

#### Private car services

Ridesharing application and limousine services are available and a popular method of transportation.

* Be vigilant when travelling in a private car
* Take note of the driver and vehicles' information

### Marine transportation

Iran and the United Arab Emirates both claim sovereignty over the islands of:

* Abu Masa
* Tunbs

Some vessels entering these areas have been reported detained.

Exercise caution if travelling by sea in the Gulf. Pirate attacks and armed robbery against ships have also occurred in coastal waters. Mariners should take appropriate precautions.
