## Natural disasters and climate

Nicaragua is subject to various natural disasters such as:

* hurricanes
* earthquakes
* volcanic eruptions
* torrential rains
* floods
* landslides

### Hurricane season

Hurricanes usually occur from mid-May to the end of November. During this period, even small tropical storms can quickly develop into major hurricanes.

These severe storms can put you at risk and hamper the provision of essential services. You could face serious safety risks during a hurricane. You should carefully consider these risks when planning a trip during hurricane season.

If you decide to travel to a coastal area during the hurricane season despite the risks:

* be prepared to change your travel plans on short notice, including cutting short or cancelling your trip
* stay informed of the latest regional weather forecasts
* carry emergency contact information for your airline or tour operator
* follow the advice and instructions of local authorities

### Rainy season

The rainy season occurs from May through November, with October being the month with the most rainfall.

Seasonal flooding can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services. Roads, including major highways, may become impassable, and bridges may be damaged. Heavy rains may also contribute to dangerous landslides.

* Monitor local media for the latest updates, including those on road conditions
* Stay away from flooded areas
* Monitor weather reports
* Follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders

### Bush and forest fires

Bush and forest fires are common between December and April.

The air quality in areas near active fires may deteriorate due to heavy smoke. In case of a major fire:

* stay away from the affected area, particularly if you suffer from respiratory ailments
* follow the instructions of local emergency services personnel
* monitor local media for up-to-date information on the situation

### Earthquakes and tsunamis

Nicaragua is located in an active seismic zone. Earthquakes and tsunamis can occur.

Even minor earthquakes can cause significant damage.

A tsunami can occur within minutes of a nearby earthquake. However, the risk of tsunami can remain for several hours following the first tremor. If you’re staying on the coast, familiarize yourself with the region’s evacuation plans in the event of a tsunami warning.

### Volcanoes

Nicaraguan authorities are closely monitoring multiple active volcanoes :

* Cerro Negro
* Concepción
* Momotombo
* San Cristóbal
* Santiago (Masaya)
* Telica

You must be accompanied by a local guide to visit some volcanoes, including the Maderas and Concepción volcanoes on Isla Ometepe.

Eruptions could occur at any time. A series of tremors could trigger evacuations of surrounding areas. Falling ash may also disrupt air traffic.

In the event of a volcanic eruption:

* monitor local media to stay informed of the evolving situation
* follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders
