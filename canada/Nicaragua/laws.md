## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Transfer to a Canadian prison

Canada and Nicaragua accede the Inter-American Convention on Serving Criminal Sentences abroad. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in Nicaragua to request a transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both Canadian and Nicaraguan authorities. This process can take a long time, and there is no guarantee that the transfer will be approved by either or both sides.

The legal system is generally cumbersome and not always transparent. If you are arrested in Nicaragua, even for a minor incident, you should expect long delays to resolve your case and you may not be allowed to leave the country.

The ability of the Embassy of Canada to Nicaragua to provide consular assistance may be limited in some circumstances.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect lengthy jail sentences or heavy fines.

* Pack your own luggage and monitor it closely at all times
* Never transport other people’s packages, bags or suitcases

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Nicaraguan law does not prohibit sexual acts between individuals of the same sex.

Outside urban areas, 2SLGBTQI+ persons could face discrimination based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or sex characteristics.

### Identification

Local authorities may request to see your identification at any time.

* Always carry valid identification or a photocopy of it
* Keep a photocopy of your passport in a safe place in case it’s lost or seized
* Keep a digital copy of your identification and travel documents

### Photography

It’s illegal to photograph official buildings.

Verify with local authorities before taking photos.

### Electronic smoking devices

E-cigarettes and similar devices are illegal.

Local authorities may confiscate them if they find you in possession of such items.

### Drones

Drones are strictly prohibited in Nicaragua.

If you do not comply with national legislation, you may face charges, including criminal charges.

### Investments

Disputes related to property acquisition or other investments are costly and take time to resolve.

If you plan to buy property, or making other investments in Nicaragua:

* seek legal advice in Canada and in Nicaragua before making commitments
* choose your own lawyer
* avoid hiring a lawyer recommended by a seller

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Nicaragua.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Nicaragua, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Nicaragua.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Nicaragua by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Nicaragua to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Driving

You can drive in Nicaragua with a valid Canadian driver’s licence.

It is prohibited for children to ride as passengers on motorcycles.

The nationwide speed limits are 50 km/h for vehicles and 40 km/h for motorcycles, regardless of signage on the roads indicating otherwise. Failure to respect these speed limits will result in fines.

In the event of a car accident:

* remain at the scene
* call 118 to report the accident and request Transit Police
* don’t move your vehicle until the authorities arrive

Leaving the scene may be considered an admission of guilt under Nicaraguan law.

However, police may not respond, especially overnight. If you feel unsafe:

* ensure your windows and doors are closed and locked
* drive to the nearest police station or a secure location
* report the accident to the police and your insurance company as soon as possible

If you are involved in a road accident causing injuries, you may be detained until a legal decision is made, regardless of culpability.

### Money

The currency in Nicaragua is the córdoba (NIO).

You cannot exchange Canadian dollars in Nicaragua. However, you can easily exchange U.S. dollars.

Credit cards are usually accepted. However, ATMs outside of major cities may not be available.

Exchange foreign currency at banks or official exchange offices only.
