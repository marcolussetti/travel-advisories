## Safety and security

### Political situation

The political situation is volatile in Nicaragua. The country has experienced periods of political unrest since April 2018, resulting in hundreds of deaths and detentions.

Since the 2021 Presidential elections, Nicaraguan government officials and law enforcement have severely repressed those critical of or opposed to government policies. According to UN reports, Nicaraguan authorities:

* undertake arbitrary arrests and detentions
* censure media
* prevent certain individuals from entering or departing Nicaragua by air or land for political reasons
* arbitrarily seize and search private property, including personal phones and computers for anti-government content
* arbitrarily charge individuals with terrorism, money laundering, and organized crime offenses for political reasons

If you are in Nicaragua:

* refrain from discussing the political situation in public or online
* avoid all political activities
* avoid posting information on social media

The ability of the Embassy of Canada to Nicaragua to provide consular assistance may be limited in some circumstances.

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs. Crime against property, such as house and car burglaries, also occurs frequently in:

* the poor neighbourhoods of the following cities:
  + Bluefields
  + Ciudad Sandino
  + León
  + Managua
  + Masaya
  + Matagalpa
  + Tipitapa
* remote areas such as beach communities on the Pacific coast
* the North Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region

In Managua, the following neighbourhoods face very high levels of assault and robbery incidents:

* Mercado oriental
* Reparto Shick
* Jorge Dimitrov
* Ciudad Belén
* Américas 1 y Américas 2
* Barrio Camilo Ortega

In these areas, thefts from cars have occurred while drivers were waiting at red lights with open windows. Thefts also commonly occur in:

* popular tourist areas
* bus terminals, train stations and airports
* hotel lobbies
* restaurants, including patios

Border areas also often see higher criminal activity and violence. Criminal gangs are more active in the border areas with Costa Rica and Honduras. Generally, the police are understaffed and lack resources.

While travelling:

* ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* keep your passport and other types of identification in different places and carry a photocopy rather than the original, including your entry stamp
* be aware of your surroundings, particularly in crowded and tourist areas
* avoid showing signs of affluence or wearing expensive jewellery
* avoid carrying large sums of cash or unnecessary valuables
* avoid deserted areas
* avoid walking alone at night
* choose well-secured accommodation

While driving:

* avoid picking up hitchhikers
* keep your windows closed and doors locked at all times
* keep your belongings out of reach
* never leave belongings unattended in a vehicle, even in the trunk
* use secure parking facilities, especially overnight
* don’t stop to change a flat tire in an isolated area
* be aware of strangers offering their help
* use the official border crossings only

### Violent crime

Violent crime, including murders, armed robberies and sexual assaults, occurs, although it is difficult to assess and likely underreported.

Most violent incidents are organized crime-related or politically motivated. Paramilitary forces and para-police, which are armed civilians in plain clothes, have committed exactions against citizens. Assaults mostly take place in major cities but sometimes also in rural areas.

Foreigners are rarely targeted but you could find yourself in the wrong place at the wrong time.

### Express kidnappings

Express kidnappings, where kidnappers demand small immediate ransoms, have occurred.

Kidnappers usually take the victim to an ATM and force them to make a cash withdrawal. The victim is sometimes held overnight for a second withdrawal the next day.

Criminal taxi drivers sometimes use this ploy.

* Only use reputable taxi companies
* Avoid hailing a taxi on the street
* If you are threatened, do not resist

### Demonstrations and civil unrest

Demonstrations and civil unrest may occur.

Nicaraguan law prohibits political activity by foreigners. Participating in demonstrations or promoting dissent, including on social media, may result in you being detained or deported.

Even peaceful demonstrations, although infrequent, can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud occurs. Be cautious when using debit or credit cards:

* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

### Women’s safety

Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse.

Local authorities may not regard harassment as unlawful unless physical contact or explicit threats are made.

### Water activities

Coastal waters can be dangerous, especially on the Pacific Coast. Riptides are common.

Rescue services may not be consistent with international standards. Warning signs, lifeguards and rescue equipment are often limited.

Drownings occur regularly.

* Never swim alone, after hours or outside marked areas
* Consult residents and tour operators for information on possible hazards and safe swimming areas
* Only undertake scuba diving and other water activities with a well-established company
* Monitor weather warnings
* Follow the instructions of local authorities

### Adventure tourism

Outdoor activities, such as white-water rafting, scuba diving, surfing, canopy touring, hiking other adventure activities can be dangerous if unprepared. Trails are not always marked, and weather conditions can change rapidly, even during summer.

If you intend to practice adventure tourism:

* never do so alone, and do not part with your expedition companions
* obtain detailed information on your activity and on the environment in which you will be before setting out
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* avoid venturing off marked trails
* avoid camping or sleeping overnight on beaches
* ensure that you’re adequately equipped and bring sufficient water
* stay informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* know the symptoms of high-altitude illnesses, which can be fatal
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary
* refrain from using facilities or equipment if you have doubts on their safety

### Road travel

#### Road conditions

Road conditions and road safety are poor throughout the country. Except on the Pan-American Highway, driving conditions may be hazardous due to:

* potholes
* inadequate lighting
* narrow or unpaved roads
* lack of guardrails
* lack of traffic signs
* unnamed streets
* roaming livestock

#### Road safety

Drivers don’t always respect traffic laws. They often drive at excessive speeds. They may be aggressive and reckless. Drinking and driving is prevalent.

Vehicles are poorly maintained. Roadside assistance is not available. Cell phone coverage outside urban areas can be lacking, particularly in mountainous areas. If you drive in Nicaragua:

* always drive defensively
* plan your trip ahead of time, especially if you plan to visit a rural area
* avoid road travel at night
* travel in convoys of at least two vehicles
* keep your car doors locked and the windows closed at all times
* avoid picking up hitchhikers
* carry a cell phone and a charger

### Public transportation

Public transportation is unreliable and often overcrowded. Vehicles are generally in poor condition.

#### Buses

Pickpockets often target tourists on public buses. Travellers have also been assaulted when getting off a bus.

* Don’t reveal your intended destination
* Don’t share a cab with strangers at the end of a bus ride
* Be cautious of any advice that could convince you to get off a bus earlier than planned to take a shortcut

#### Taxis

Many taxis are in poor condition and lack safety features such as seat belts. Express kidnappings have occurred in unauthorized taxis. It’s common practice for taxi drivers to pick up other passengers en route.

If using taxi services while in Nicaragua:

* use only Pink taxis booked ahead of time or a trusted ride-sharing app
* agree on a fare with the driver for a private ride before departure
* avoid sharing taxis with strangers
* note driver’s name and plate number
* avoid boarding taxis at taxi stands or flagging taxis in the street
