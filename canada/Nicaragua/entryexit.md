# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

The authorities of a country or territory decide who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Nicaraguan authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid at least 6 months beyond the date you expect to leave Nicaragua.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with a “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

You should also be aware that current systems used by some countries and travel companies may not recognize the “X” gender identifier. You may still be asked to provide your sex/gender information as either male or female when travelling.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Visas

Tourist visa: not required for stays of up to 90 days  
 Business visa: not required  
 Student visa: not required  
 Residency visa: required

Renewal of a residency visa is at the discretion of immigration authorities.

If you undertake this process, you may have to produce numerous documents showing your right to be in the country. You may also face lengthy interrogations.

### Entry stamp

Immigration authorities will stamp your passport upon arrival and write down the number of days you are allowed in the country. The 90-day period is not guaranteed, and the decision is at their discretion.

You may face fines and possible delays if you fail to present an entry-stamped passport when departing Nicaragua.

* Make sure your passport has been stamped upon arrival
* Take good note of the maximum length of the approved stay

### Central America-4 Border Control Agreement

Under the terms of the Central America-4 Border Control Agreement (CA-4), Canadian tourists may travel freely within any of the following CA-4 countries:

* El Salvador
* Guatemala
* Honduras
* Nicaragua

You can travel between these countries for up to 90 days without having to undergo entry and exit formalities at border immigration checkpoints.

You must still check in at immigration counters when you enter or exit these checkpoints.

The 90-day period begins at the first point of entry to any of the CA-4 countries. You will be fined if you exceed the 90-day limit.

You may request an extension of up to 90 days once a year. You must request this extension and pay the required fee at the Nicaraguan General Directorate of Migration and Foreign Nationals before your first 90-day limit expires. Immigration authorities will determine the length of the extension.
