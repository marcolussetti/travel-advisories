### Elections

### Road safety

Road safety is a major security risk in Côte d'Ivoire.

Pedestrians and drivers should exercise caution, as the number of road accidents is high, and emergency rescue services are limited or non-existent in some areas. Cycling is not recommended.

#### Road conditions

Road conditions vary throughout the country.

Main roads are generally paved, while secondary roads are mostly dirt roads.

Driving can be dangerous due to:

* numerous motorcycles present on the road
* poorly maintained roads and potholes
* stray livestok
* lack of traffic signs
* traffic jams and heavy traffic, especially in urban areas
* overturned or broken-down vehicles blocking the road
* insufficient lighting and vehicles not using their headlights
* bad weather, especially during the rainy season

#### Driving habits

Drivers don't always obey traffic laws. Drivers often drive at excessive speeds. They can be aggressive and reckless.

 If you choose to drive in Côte d'Ivoire:

* always drive defensively
* avoid travelling alone and after dark
* keep doors locked and windows closed at all times
* never leave personal belongings unattended in a vehicle, even in the trunk
* bring a cell phone, charger and local emergency numbers
* familiarize yourself with your itinerary before you leave
* ask about insurance coverage options for roadside assistance when you rent a vehicle

#### Ambushes

Armed criminals, locally known as "coupeurs de route", are present on secondary and deserted roads.

They set up roadblocks to intercept vehicles, both private cars and public transport vehicles. The criminals force vehicles to stop at gunpoint, sometimes assaulting passengers.

Incidents occur at all hours of the day, including at night. They occur mainly in areas of agricultural production (cocoa, coffee, natural rubber and cashew nuts) and gold panning.

#### Roadblocks

Roadblocks are common throughout the country, especially at the entrances and exits of major cities.

 You may be asked to identify yourself.

* Expect the presence of the gendarmerie
* Don't drive through a roadblock without stopping, even if it seems unguarded
* If you are stopped, follow the gendarmerie's instructions

### Public transportation

Public transport services are limited and not all are safe. Avoid using public transport services.

#### Buses

Drivers of mini-buses, "Gbaka", do not always respect traffic laws.

Most Société des Transports d'Abidjan (SOTRA) buses are overcrowded and theft is frequent.

#### Taxis and taxi web applications

Taxis are frequently involved in traffic accidents. Passengers are sometimes mugged or robbed by cab drivers.

Group taxis, known as “woro-woro", and car taxis are available in major cities, but are not always well maintained. Most don't have air-conditioning and their mechanics are unreliable.

Web-based ride-sharing applications from home-based taxis companies are available.

If you choose to take a taxi:

* ask for your taxi at reception if you are using hotel services
* use only registered taxis
* confirm the driver's identity and license plate before getting into the car if you're using a taxi ridesharing app
* make sure the driver does not pick up other passengers on the way to your destination
* make sure the taxi's doors and windows are securely closed
* negotiate the fare in advance
