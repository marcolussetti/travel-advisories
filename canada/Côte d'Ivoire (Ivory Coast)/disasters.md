### Rainy season

The rainy season extends from:

* May to July and October to November in the southern coastal region
* mid-March to mid-May and mid-July to mid-October in the central and north-central regions
* from July to November in the northern region

Heavy rains can cause flash floods and landslides, interrupt essential services and hamper overland travel.

* Monitor local media for the latest updates, including those on road conditions
* Stay away from flooded areas
* Follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders

### Seasonal wind

The harmattan, a hot wind from the Sahara, blows between December and February.

Be on the lookout for symptoms of dehydration, heatstroke and flu caused by the omnipresent dust, all of which can be fatal.
