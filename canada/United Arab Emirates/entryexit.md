# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the authorities of the United Arab Emirates. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond your date of entry into the United Arab Emirates.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other entry requirements

The authorities of the United Arab Emirates only accept Canadian temporary passports for exit and transit. Travellers cannot enter the UAE when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document.

### Visas

Tourist visa: required (on arrival)  
 Business visa: required  
 Student visa: required

If you’re entering the UAE as a tourist, you must get a visa on arrival at the port of entry. This visa is free and allows you to stay for 90 days within a 180-day period. The 90 days start from your first entry date, whether you stay continuously or not, and must be used within 180 days.

### Health entry requirements

Medical tests, including tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis infections, are required to obtain or renew a work or residency permit. Emirati authorities don’t recognize foreign-issued HIV test results.

If you test positive for HIV or another communicable disease such as hepatitis or tuberculosis, you may be subject to:

* detention
* deportation
* quarantine
* mandatory treatment

It’s also forbidden to enter the UAE with HIV/AIDS antiretroviral medication for personal use. If you do so, you may be subject to:

* scrutiny
* detention
* deportation

### Exit requirements

You must exit the UAE with the passport you used for entry.

If you obtained a new passport during your stay in the UAE, you should consult the immigration authorities before travelling to ensure your visa was properly transferred to the new document.

Previous or expired visas must be formally cancelled by the organization or the individuals sponsoring your work or residency visa. If your previous visa has not been cancelled, you may be prevented from leaving the UAE or face difficulties returning in the future.

### Exit bans

UAE authorities may place an exit ban on certain individuals to prevent them from leaving the country.

An exit ban can relate to investigations into:

* an individual, their family or an employer
* criminal and civil matters, including business disputes
* employment without a valid work permit
* unpaid financial debts

An exit ban can be requested by people involved in any of these circumstances. You may not be aware that authorities have placed an exit ban on you until you try to leave the country.

Your passport may be seized until the case is fully investigated and settled.

If you face an exit ban, you should seek legal advice.

### Children and travel

Children born to a father who holds Emirati citizenship acquire UAE citizenship at birth, regardless of where they were born.

They must enter and leave the country on a UAE passport.
