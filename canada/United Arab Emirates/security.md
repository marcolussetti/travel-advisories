# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Ongoing hostilities in the Middle East

The security situation in the region could deteriorate significantly without notice.

There are reports of military debris falling in various locations. This may result in disruptions to movement and transportation, including:

* border closures or restrictions
* flight cancellations
* airspace closures

You should:

* monitor local and international media to stay informed of the rapidly evolving situation
* be vigilant and follow the instructions of local authorities at all times, including any orders to shelter in place
* sign up with the [Registration of Canadians Abroad](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/registration) service to receive important information about the crisis
* ensure that your travel documents and those of your family are up to date

### Terrorism

There’s an ongoing threat of terrorism. Terrorist groups have indicated their intention to target the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Enhanced security measures are in place, and Emirati authorities may reinforce them on short notice.

Terrorist attacks could occur at any time.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, military installations and schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places. Be particularly vigilant during sporting events, religious holidays and other public celebrations. Terrorists may use such occasions to mount attacks.

### Missile strikes and drones

Conflicts in the Middle East and the Gulf region can affect the UAE. Regional tensions can flare up at any time, resulting in an unpredictable and volatile security situation.

Armed groups in the region have publicly stated their intention to target neighbouring countries, including the UAE, with drones and missiles.  Drone attacks continue to either reach UAE territory or be intercepted over the country.

 Missiles and drones have reached:

* urban areas
* military installations
* oil industry infrastructure
* public facilities, such as airports

Their interception may cause scattered debris or fragments.

During missile and drone strikes:

* seek shelter
* stay away from doors and windows
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If you encounter debris or fragments:

* don’t get close to or touch them
* move away from them immediately
* contact local authorities

### Crime

The crime rate is low. Petty crime, such as pickpocketing, purse snatching and theft from cars may occur.

During your stay:

* make sure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* don’t leave personal items and documents in plain sight in a vehicle
* keep your car doors locked and windows closed at all times

Violent crime is rare.

### Fraud

#### Credit card and ATM fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud occur. Be cautious when using debit or credit cards:

* pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others
* use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

### Cybercrime

Cybercrime, malware attacks and online extortion are common in the UAE. Perpetrators may compromise public Wi-Fi networks to steal credit card or personal information.

* Avoid using public Wi-Fi networks
* Avoid making purchases on unencrypted websites
* Be cautious when posting information on social media
* Be particularly vigilant when contacting or meeting individuals known over the Internet

#### Telephone scams

Foreigners have received calls from scammers claiming to be local authorities or financial institutions. The caller may try to collect personal information or request a fund transfer to resolve administrative or customs issues.

Don’t send any money or personal information in this type of situation.

#### Romance scams

Romance scams are common. Victims of these types of scams have lost thousands of dollars. Before travelling to the UAE to visit someone you met online:

* keep in mind that you may be the victim of a scam
* inform yourself about the country’s customs and laws on conjugal relations and marriage
* be sure to retain possession of your return plane ticket, money, and passport

### Women’s safety

Although rare, women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment, verbal abuse, or physical assaults.

Local authorities may not respond adequately to reports of sexual violence and harassment. Emirati authorities have detained women reporting sexual assault. The victim must prove that the sex was not consensual to avoid being charged. The notion of sexual consent may differ substantially from the Canadian context.

If you are the victim of a sexual assault, you should report it immediately to the nearest Government of Canada office.

* Avoid travelling alone, especially at night
* Remain particularly vigilant in less populous areas

Be careful when dealing with strangers or recent acquaintances

### Spiked food and drinks

Snacks, beverages, gum and cigarettes may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

* Be wary of accepting these items from new acquaintances
* Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers

### Water activities

Coastal waters can be dangerous. Rip currents occur at beaches and can sweep swimmers out to sea.

Rescue services may not be consistent with international standards. Some beaches don’t have lifeguards or warning flags.

* Only participate in scuba diving and other water activities with a well-established company
* Don’t swim alone, after hours or outside marked areas
* Consult residents and tour operators for information on possible hazards and safe swimming areas
* Monitor weather warnings
* Follow the instructions of local authorities

### Adventure tourism

Desert expeditions or trekking can be dangerous, especially if they are not well organized. Trails are not always marked, and weather conditions can change rapidly.

If you undertake desert expeditions:

* never do so alone
* always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company
* travel in a 4 x 4 vehicle
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* avoid venturing off marked trails
* ensure that you’re properly equipped and carry sufficient water supply
* know the symptoms of dehydration and heatstroke, both of which can be fatal
* ensure that you’re well informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary, including when you expect to be back
* obtain detailed information on each activity before setting out

### Road safety

Road safety varies across the UAE.

Accidents causing fatalities are common.

Pedestrians should be particularly careful and should always use designated crossings, pedestrian bridges or underpasses.

#### Road conditions

Road conditions are excellent throughout the UAE. Driving conditions may be hazardous during sandstorms or foggy conditions due to limited visibility.

* Avoid off-road driving unless you’re in a convoy of 4 x 4 vehicles
* Leave your travel itinerary with a third party
* Ensure that you’re well prepared with a cell phone and a sufficient supply of gasoline, water and food

#### Driving habits

Drivers can be reckless. They often tailgate and drive at excessive speeds.

If you choose to drive in the UAE:

* always drive defensively
* maintain distance from other vehicles on the road
* familiarize yourself with your itinerary before leaving
* always carry a cell phone and charger
* keep a list of emergency numbers with you

### Public transportation

The emirates of Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Sharjah, have reliable and modern public transportation systems. Public transportation options are more limited in the other emirates.

#### Buses

Public buses in the UAE are generally modern, safe and efficient. Most emirates have public buses and inter-emirates buses operating on their own schedule.

#### Taxis

Taxis are convenient to travel within cities and between the emirates.

Street taxis use meters while private taxis have flat rates.

Pink taxis (in Dubai) and purple taxis (in Abu Dhabi) are reserved for and driven by women.

Special taxis for people with special needs or disabilities are also available.

* Use only officially marked taxis or trusted ride-sharing app
* Avoid sharing a taxi with strangers

If using a private taxi, negotiate the fare in advance

### Sea travel

There are territorial disputes between the UAE and Iran in the Gulf over the islands of:

* Abu Musa
* Greater Tunb
* Lesser Tunb

Be cautious if you travel by sea in the Strait of Hormuz due to tense encounters that could lead to vessel and passenger detention.
