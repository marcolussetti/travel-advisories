## Natural disasters and climate

### Heat waves

Humidity and heat may be most severe during the hot season, from June to September.

Know the symptoms of dehydration and heatstroke, which can both be fatal.

### Dust storms

Sandstorms and dust storms may occur any time, particularly during the summer months.

Winds carrying sand can blow at high speeds for days, creating difficult driving conditions. Poor visibility can affect flights. These storms can also cause respiratory problems, which can be fatal for some individuals.

During a storm:

* stay indoors
* keep windows closed
* follow the instructions of local emergency services personnel
* monitor local media for up-to-date information on the situation

### Drought and flooding

The UAE has been facing a water crisis in recent years, leading to drought and desertification.

Although rare, heavy rain does occur in winter months from December to March. It can result in flash floods in dry riverbeds and canyons.

Flash floods and landslides can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable and bridges damaged.

* Monitor local news and weather reports
* Follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders

### Fog

During winter, periods of severe fog can hinder transportation and visibility.

* Exercise caution, particularly while driving
* Expect travel delays
* Monitor local news and weather reports
* Follow the advice of local authorities
