## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

Penalties for breaking the law in the UAE can be more severe than in Canada, even for similar offences. No transfer of offender's treaty exists between Canada and the UAE. If you’re convicted of a serious crime, you must serve your jail sentence in the UAE.

### Legal process

UAE authorities routinely notify the Embassy of Canada or Consulate following the arrest of a Canadian citizen.

If you are arrested, request that the arresting authorities immediately notify the nearest Canadian government office of your arrest*.*If you are not allowed to do so, ask a friend or family member to contact the Embassy or Consulate of Canada.

The UAE and Canadian criminal law systems are significantly different. Laws, penalties and legal procedures vary according to the emirate.

Detention during the investigative period is common and can be lengthy. You may be held without access to legal counsel or consular assistance. You may also have to remain in the UAE for a parole period after your release.

If you’re involved in legal proceedings, local authorities can prevent you from leaving the UAE by withholding your passport or enforcing an exit ban. Familiarize yourself with the rules and laws of each emirate to which you intend to travel.

### Death penalty

Although rarely carried out, the death penalty can be applied in the UAE.

If you are convicted of a crime, you can face:

* corporal punishment
* deportation
* the death penalty

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations rarely occur. Gatherings must be authorized in advance by local authorities.

Emirati law prohibits organizing or participating in unauthorized gatherings.

Convicted offenders could face severe penalties, including heavy fines and prison sentences up to life under various charges, such as:

* rioting
* preventing or disrupting the implementation of laws and regulation
* disturbing public peace or security

Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use, or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe.

 Convicted offenders can expect:

* heavy fines
* jail sentences
* the death penalty for severe offences, including drug trafficking

The UAE has a zero-tolerance policy towards drugs, even for travellers in transit. Detection of drugs (including cannabis) in blood or urine tests can also lead to a conviction.

### Alcohol

Although it’s legal to consume alcohol in private homes and licensed venues, it’s a punishable offence to drink or be under the influence of alcohol in public. Even passengers in transit through the UAE can be arrested if they’re under the influence of alcohol.

Don’t drink alcohol outside private homes or licensed venues.

### Medications

Certain prescription and over-the-counter medications legally available in Canada, such as codeine and psychiatric medications, are classified as controlled substances in the UAE. It’s illegal to bring them into the country, even in small quantities, without prior permission from the UAE Ministry of Health.

If you attempt to bring banned medication into the UAE without prior approval and required documentation, you may be subject to:

* confiscation of medication
* heavy fines
* jail sentences

Medical tests are mandatory to obtain or renew your residency permit. You could face prosecution if traces of prohibited substances are detected in your urine or blood sample, even if you haven’t imported the medication into the UAE.

Consult the Ministry of Health and Prevention’s list of controlled medicines to determine if you must obtain a permission to import any required medication. You can obtain a permission by creating a profile online and completing an electronic form.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Emirati law criminalizes sexual acts and relationships between persons of the same sex.

2SLGBTQI+ persons could be detained based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or sex characteristics. They could also be detained and face other charges such as:

* cross dressing
* gross indecency
* offence to public morals

2SLGBTQI+ persons could face:

* heavy fines
* jail sentences
* corporal punishment
* deportation
* the death penalty

They should carefully consider the risks of travelling to the UAE.

### Dress and behaviour

UAE customs, laws and regulations adhere closely to Islamic practices and beliefs. Public displays of affection, including holding hands and kissing, may attract the attention of local authorities. Verbal insults and obscene gestures may be considered criminal acts.

Foreign female travellers are not expected to wear head covers. However, revealing clothing is considered inappropriate.

To avoid offending local sensitivities:

* dress conservatively
* behave discreetly
* respect religious and social traditions
* interact on social media with the same care as you would in person
* seek permission from locals before photographing them

### Ramadan

In 2025, the lunar month of Ramadan is expected to begin on or around February 28.

In public, between sunrise and sunset, refrain from:

* drinking
* eating
* smoking

In Abu Dhabi and Dubai during Ramadan, restaurants remain open, serving food as normal. Most government and public sector businesses have reduced working hours.

### Religious proselytism

Religious proselytism is illegal.

You should avoid engaging in religious activities that contradict or challenge Islamic teachings and values. This includes preaching, possessing or distributing religious literature or material.

### Lèse-majesté

It’s illegal to criticize or disrespect the UAE’s:

* ruling families
* political system
* institutions

This includes comments made on social media.

Punishment can be severe, including lengthy jail terms.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in the UAE.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of the UAE, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different entry/exit requirements.

Emirati authorities determine your citizenship based on the passport you use to enter the country. Ensure you use the same passport to enter and exit the country. Using different passports may lead to detention and delays.

[Dual citizens](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/documents/dual-citizenship?_ga=2.145632180.1604988387.1722891959-1748139045.1691506137)

### Family law

UAE family law is different from Canadian family law. Decisions are based on Islamic law.

Children of an Emirati father automatically acquire Emirati citizenship at birth.

Although the courts will review each case individually, custody of boys under the age of 11 and girls under 13 is normally awarded to the mother. Custody is normally transferred to the father once boys reach 11 and once girls reach the age of 13.

Regardless of which parent is awarded custody, fathers are normally given guardianship responsibilities for the children by the courts, granting them significant legal rights. Guardians have the right to hold the child’s passport and can legally prevent the child from exiting the UAE.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and the United Arab Emirates.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in the United Arab Emirates by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in the United Arab Emirates to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Cohabitation outside of marriage

Heterosexual sex and cohabitation outside of marriage for individuals over 18 years of age was recently decriminalised in all Emirates except Sharjah. This applies only to couples in which both partners are from countries that don’t follow Islamic Shariah marriage laws. While the practice is decriminalised, it may still be viewed negatively by parts of Emirati society.

Extramarital sex remains illegal in certain cases where a case is brought forth based on a complaint from the husband or guardian.

### Online behaviour

Laws related to online behaviour, which also apply to the use of social media, are strict. Comments or behaviours considered defamatory, antisocial, culturally insensitive, or contrary to morality may be punishable by:

* fines
* imprisonment
* deportation

The authorities also restrict the use of virtual private networks (VPNs). Social media influencers receiving compensation for advertisements and product placement require a UAE influencer licence. If you do so without a licence, you may be fined or detained.

Certain local sponsors may attempt to retain your passport, even if UAE law forbids this practice.

* Never leave your passport or any other identity document with anyone

### Driving

You must carry an international driving permit to drive and rent a car in the UAE, except in Dubai where you can use your Canadian driver’s license. If you become a resident of the UAE, you can convert your Canadian driver’s license to the UAE driving license at the Traffic Department of each Emirate. For Abu Dhabi, you can do this via [TAMM services](https://www.tamm.abudhabi/en/life-events/individual/DriveTransport/Driving-Licences/requesttoreplaceadrivinglicenceissuedfromanothercountry).

The country has a zero-tolerance policy for drinking and driving. The legal blood alcohol limit is zero.

Penalties for drinking and driving are severe.  If the police suspect you of drinking and driving, they could oblige you to provide a blood or urine sample. If alcohol or drugs are detected, you may be prosecuted.

If you’re convicted, you can expect:

* heavy fines and a lengthy jail sentence
* vehicle confiscation
* driver’s license suspension

If involved in an accident:

* don't leave the scene
* don't move your vehicle
* call the police

Failure to remain at the site may be considered an admission of guilt depending on the emirate in which the accident occurred.

The UAE government may prevent you from leaving the country until all injury claims have been settled, regardless of which party is at fault. If the accident has resulted in death, you may be legally required to provide financial compensation to the deceased’s family.

Local judicial resolution process may take several months, even for minor accidents.
