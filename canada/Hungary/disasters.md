### Flooding

Spring flooding can occur between March and May. It occurs annually in the northeast, along the watershed of the upper Tisza River. There is also periodic spring flooding along the Danube River.

These conditions can put you at risk and hamper the provision of essential services. If you decide to travel to Hungary during these periods:

* be prepared to change your travel plans on short notice, including cutting short or cancelling your trip
* stay informed of the latest regional weather forecasts
* carry emergency contact information for your airline or tour operator
* follow the advice and instructions of local authorities
