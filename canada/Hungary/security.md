## Safety and security

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and bag snatching, occurs. Thieves target tourists.

Theft occurs, particularly in crowded public areas such as:

* buses, trains, bus and train stations, and airports
* shopping centres
* public markets

 During your trip:

* keep your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, in a secure place
* don’t show signs of affluence or wear expensive jewellery
* don’t carry large sums of cash or valuables unnecessarily

Car thefts and highway robberies may occur. Tactics are used by thieves to persuade drivers to pull over, allowing them to steal items from the distracted driver’s car.

* Be cautious when stopping at gas stations and highway parking areas, especially after dark
* Be wary of individuals experiencing roadside emergencies (for example, a smoking engine, a flat tire, etc.)

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in Europe. Terrorist attacks have occurred in a number of European cities. There is a potential for other violent incidents.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations occur periodically. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

If you participate in illegal or banned demonstrations, you can be identified by facial recognition technology and face large fines.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Spiked food and drinks

Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

### Scams

A small number of restaurants and clubs don’t list prices, particularly in areas frequented by tourists.

Some scams involve surcharges on final bills for drinks or meals. If you are unable to pay the bill, you’ll likely be accompanied by the establishment’s security guard to an ATM and forced to withdraw funds while possibly being threatened. Taxi drivers are sometimes accomplices in these scams.

Young women sometimes approach travellers at reputable bars with invitations to socialize at a nearby bar. Once at the new bar, some travellers fall victim to criminal activity or receive very large bills for drinks and entertainment.

* Ask to see a menu with prices clearly listed before ordering
* Avoid discussions regarding overcharging, as they could lead to violence
* Don’t ask taxi drivers to recommend bars or clubs

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety are generally good throughout the country.

Roads may be narrow, badly lit and poorly maintained. Drivers may be aggressive or reckless.   
  
Traffic congestion and parking availability in large cities can be a problem.

### Public transportation

Buses, trams, the metro and trains are reliable means of transportation. Delays and disruptions at border crossings, including while travelling by bus or train, may occur.

Lock your compartment door from the inside on overnight trains.

#### Taxis

If you plan to use a taxi in Hungary:

* only use officially marked taxis
* call a taxi through a dispatcher rather than hailing one on the street
* ensure that the meter is on and charges the appropriate rate, which should be displayed in the taxi

Incidents of overcharging by taxi drivers have occurred. If you think your taxi driver has overcharged you:

* take note of the taxi information
* ask for a receipt
* contact the taxi company to report the incident
