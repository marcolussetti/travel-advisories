## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Transfer to a Canadian prison

Canada and Hungary are signatories to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in Hungary to request a transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both Canadian and Hungary authorities.

This process can take a long time, and there is no guarantee that the transfer will be approved by either or both sides.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect prison sentences and heavy fines.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

A new child protection law passed in March 2025 has been used to ban the Budapest Pride March and could continue to be used as the legal basis to ban future 2SLGBTQI+ Pride events. This law also allows authorities to use facial recognition technology to identify and fine anyone who takes part in these events.

Hungarian law doesn’t prohibit sexual acts between individuals of the same sex. However, homosexuality isn’t widely accepted in Hungarian society.

Proposed changes to Hungary's constitution may limit transgender individuals' rights to legal gender recognition.

2SLGBTQI+ travellers should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Hungary.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Hungary.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Hungary, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Hungary.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Hungary, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Hungarian court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Hungary to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Identification

You must carry photo identification, such as your passport, at all times. Photocopies are not accepted. Keep a photocopy of your passport in a safe place, in case it’s lost or confiscated.

### Driving

Police strictly enforce traffic regulations.

The legal blood alcohol limit is 0.00%. Penalties for drinking and driving are severe. If a police officer suspects you of drinking and driving, they could confiscate your driver’s licence on the spot. If you’re convicted, you can expect heavy fines and jail sentences.

Police also conduct routine road checks, including the administration of breathalyser tests. Police automatically administer breathalyser tests following an accident.

Police issue a ticket indicating the amount of the fine for traffic violations. This fine is to be paid at any post office.

Police may retain your driver’s licence if you dispute a fine or offence. They’ll then issue a receipt and letter instructing you to report to a police station. Your driver’s licence is returned upon settlement of the dispute.

You should carry an international driving permit.

#### Vignettes

You’ll need a motorway vignette (permit) to travel on highways. You may purchase these electronic vignettes at gas stations, online or using your mobile phone. If the vendor doesn’t issue stickers, you must keep receipts for one year as proof of payment.

### Public transportation

You must validate your ticket at the start of your journey. You must show it to an inspector upon request. Violators are subject to fines, or arrest and prosecution.

### Money

The currency in Hungary is the forint (HUF).

Euros are accepted in Budapest and some other major cities where a sign is posted. Rates may not be very competitive. Don’t use unofficial moneychangers.

If you are carrying €10,000 or more, or the equivalent in other currencies or monetary instruments, you must make a declaration to customs when you enter or leave the European Union.

This does not apply if you are travelling within the European Union or in transit to a non-EU country.
