# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Russian authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Land border crossings

Finnish authorities have closed border crossings along the land border with Russia. Since April 15, 2024, land and maritime border crossings are closed to vehicles and personal watercraft. Vehicles registered in Russia can no longer enter Finland, even if entering from a third country.

Polish authorities have closed certain border crossings with Russia (Kaliningrad). If you intend to travel from Russia to Poland, you must apply for a humanitarian permit. If you plan to cross from Poland to Russia, only the following border crossings remain open for cars and buses:

* Grzechotki/Mamonovo
* Bezledy/Bagrationovsk

Only local residents are allowed to travel by land from Russia to Belarus. This restriction applies to cars, tour buses and trains. If you intend to travel between Belarus and Russia, you must have visas for both countries and travel by air.

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond the date you expect to leave Russia.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Tourist visa

You need a tourist visa if you are staying at a hotel or other rented accommodations. Ensure that the hotel registers your visa when you check in.

You should book your travel through a travel agency, which will submit a tourist visa application on your behalf. Certain Canadian travel agencies work with Russian travel agencies or companies that act as sponsors for tourist visas.

In cases of expired tourist visas or lost or stolen Canadian passports, only the visa-sponsoring travel agency is authorized to apply for a new tourist visa on your behalf. Extensions are not issued. Holders of expired visas face heavy fines or detention upon departure.

#### Private visas

You need a private visa if you intend to stay in private accommodations.

#### Business visa

To get a business visa, you need to be sponsored by a Russian individual or organization (your host).

#### Exit visa

You must have a valid visa to be allowed to leave Russia. To avoid problems, including deportation, make sure your visa is valid beyond your intended departure date. For more information, confirm with the Embassy of Russia in Canada.

#### Visa exceptions

Contact your cruise company to find out if you need to apply for a Russian visa before your cruise starts.

Some Russian international airports have transit areas that allow for visa-free travel through Russia. If you plan to transit through Russia, check with your transportation carrier to see if transit visa exceptions apply to you.

### Migration card

You should receive a migration card upon your arrival in Russia. These cards are usually distributed on flights and trains entering Russia or at points of entry, but sometimes they are not available, even at major international airports. Even if that’s the case, you are responsible to find a migration card and fill out a migration card. You must keep and carry the stamped part of the migration card throughout your stay. The card is required for hotel registration.

If the police request to see your migration card, you must comply. You must present it, your passport and your registered visa. You must also present the card to border officials upon departure.

If you hold a multiple-entry visa, you must fill out a new migration card every time you enter Russia.

Failure to present this card upon departure may result in fines, serious delays or imprisonment.

### Registration

All foreign visitors staying for more than 7 days in Russia must register their arrival within 72 hours of entering the country (excluding weekends and national holidays). If you are staying at a hotel for your entire trip, the hotel will take care of registering your stay with the authorities. You should confirm with hotel staff that they registered your stay as soon as you arrive.

Visitors staying in private accommodations must register with the territorial office of the Federal Migration Service. Any Russian citizen with a resident registration (“propiska”) can register a foreigner staying at their home at a local police station or any post office. A small registration fee may apply. The visitor’s Russian host must be present during the process.

Violation of the rules of migration registration may result in a fine. In some cases, visitors may face expulsion from Russia and a ban from re-entering of up to 5 years.

### Customs declaration form

Upon arrival in Russia, you must fill out a customs declaration form, then go through the red customs line and have the form stamped by a customs official. Without the stamp, any undeclared currency and valuables, including items that could be considered antique, may be confiscated upon departure.

You must declare amounts of currency exceeding US$10,000 at border crossings. You may also be required to provide information on the origin of the money and its intended use. Any amount not declared on the form will be confiscated if you have not obtained an official bank receipt authorizing the clearance of these sums. You must keep your declaration form until you leave the country.

You must fill out a second customs declaration form when you leave the country and present the two forms to a customs official. You must declare any amount greater than RUB 3,000. If you fail to declare in writing the amount of currency in your possession, the undeclared currency and valuables may be confiscated and you may be detained and charged with criminal offence, which may result in imprisonment.

### Special permits and restricted areas

Travel to and residency in several Russian cities and regions is restricted. You must obtain permission from local authorities prior to entering a restricted city or region. Failure to do so may result in arrest, fines and/or deportation. Attach an itinerary to your visa application to avoid delays. Some areas must be specifically indicated in the visa, and you may have to pay an extra fee to include them.

### Passport requirements for individuals holding both Canadian and Russian citizenships

If you have dual citizenship, you must enter and leave Russia on a Russian passport.

If your Russian passport expires before you travel to Russia, Russian authorities in Canada can extend it for entry into Russia only. If the passport expires during your stay in Russia, you must obtain a new one before you leave. Renewing a Russian passport may take several months.

If you enter Russia with a repatriation certificate issued by Russian authorities abroad, you may not be allowed to leave on a Canadian passport. This certificate is only valid for one-way travel into Russia.

### Entry ban on vehicles with Russian license plates

In September 2023, Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania and Finland announced a ban on vehicles with Russian license plates entering their respective territories. The ban is enforced at the border as a result of existing European Union sanctions on the Russian Federation. Lithuania allows an exception for travellers able to prove transiting Lithuania to and from the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad.

Other countries from the EU or the Schengen area have introduced similar bans. You should confirm with local authorities before travelling to the EU or Schengen area.

### Health entry requirements

If you are planning to remain in Russia for more than 3 months, you must provide a medical certificate of a negative test for HIV infection. The certificate must be valid for 3 months from the date of testing and include:

* passport details (full name, date of birth, passport number and country of residence)
* HIV test information (date of test, test results and signatures of the doctor who performed the test and the person examined)
* the length of your intended stay in Russia

Other tests (such as for tuberculosis and leprosy) may be required for individuals staying in Russia for more than 3 months.
