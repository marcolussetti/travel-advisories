### RUSSIA - AVOID ALL TRAVEL

[Avoid all travel](#levels "Risk Levels") to Russia due to the impacts of the armed conflict with Ukraine and the risk of terrorism.

The armed conflict in Ukraine has led to armed incursions and shelling in areas close to the Russian-Ukrainian border. Drone strikes, explosions, and fires have occurred further into Russia’s interior. The impacts of the armed conflict with Ukraine could also include:

* partial military mobilization
* restrictions on financial transactions
* limited flight options

* you may have to stay in Russia longer than expected
* you will not be able to access your funds in Canadian or most international financial institutions
* you should not depend on the Government of Canada to help you leave the country

* refrain from discussing political developments in public or online
* avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* make sure you have an adequate supply of cash, essential items and medications
* avoid any area where there are military installations or activity
* monitor trustworthy news sources to stay informed on the evolving situation
* register and update your contact information through the [Registration of Canadians Abroad service](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/registration) and encourage other Canadian citizens in Russia to do so

If you plan to leave Russia:
