## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### “Undesirable” Organizations

Certain Canadian institutions, including NGOs, community organizations and educational institutions are considered “undesirable” by the Russian authorities. If you have a current or previous affiliation with these groups, you may be denied entry to Russia or face increased scrutiny at the border or in the country. You may face deportation if you are already in Russia.

### Identification

Authorities frequently perform random identity checks in public places.

You must carry the following identification documents at all times:

* a valid passport with two blank pages for stamps
* a valid Russian visa
* your migration card
* your stamped registration notification

You may be fined or detained if you cannot provide proper documentation to Russian authorities.

Only the special police of the Federal Migration Bureau have the authority to arrest, detain and impose fines on improperly documented foreigners. If you are stopped in the street and requested to pay a fine, ask to see the officer’s name and identification, and to contact the Embassy of Canada to Russia in Moscow.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect jail sentences and heavy fines.

### Minors participating in demonstrations

It is illegal for minors (those under 18) to participate in unauthorized protests. Adults who involve minors in such protests could face up to 15 days in jail and fines of up to RUB1 million.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Although the laws of Russia do not prohibit homosexual activity, Russian federal law prohibits public actions that are described as promoting homosexuality and “non-traditional sexual relations.”

Since January 2024, Russian law treats organizations advocating for 2SLGBTQI+ persons or issues as “extremist.” Previous laws banning “LGBT propaganda” and “the international LGBT movement” reflect an increasingly restrictive environment for 2SLGBTQI+ persons and their allies. Actions that contravene or appear to contravene this law may lead to arrest, a fine, jail time and deportation. Examples of such actions include:

* the dissemination of information, for example, through public statements
* public displays of affection.
* displaying symbols associated with 2SLGBTQI+ identities, cultures, or organizations, including flags
* showing or sharing media, including books and advertising, related to 2SLGBTQI+ themes or information

Same sex marriage is not recognized in Russia. Homosexuality isn’t socially accepted.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Russia.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of Russia, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

If you are also a Russian citizen and reside in Russia or hold permanent residency status in another country, you must declare this citizenship or residency status to your local migration office.

You may also be subject to certain legal obligations, including military service. You may be detained, imprisoned, or fined large sums if you try to avoid military service. Seek advice from the nearest Russian embassy or consulate before travelling to Russia or consult official sources from the Government of the Russian Federation.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Russia.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Russia by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Russia to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Religious activity

Religious activity is heavily regulated in Russia. If you plan to engage in religious activity, such as missionary work, make sure you do not break local laws.

### Driving

You should carry an international driving permit.

You may drive with a Canadian driver’s licence if you carry a notarized Russian translation. You must obtain a local permit if you stay longer than 6 months.

The legal blood alcohol content limit is significantly lower than in Canada. Those found guilty of drinking and driving can expect heavy fines, suspension of their driving permit and immediate detention. Repeat offenders may face prison sentences.

The traffic police can impose fines on drivers for traffic violations. They can conduct identity checks on pedestrians, but they are not authorized to impose fines. The same is true of police in the underground metro systems.

### Imports and exports

The importation and use of electronic equipment are strictly controlled. Foreigners have faced charges of espionage for possessing improperly certified GPS devices, such as those used for geological mapping.

You must obtain a certificate from the Ministry of Culture to export items that appear old (prior to 1945) or may have cultural value. Customs officials may conduct thorough baggage searches and can arrest you if you don’t have the necessary certificate.

Contact the nearest Russian embassy or consulate or consult the Federal Customs Service prior to departure for up-to-date information on customs requirements.

### Money

The currency of Russia is the Russian ruble (RUB).

Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, major Western-issued credit card corporations no longer operate in Russia. Credit and debit cards from outside of Russia will not work at banks, businesses, or ATMs within Russia. ATMs are common in major cities and will accept cards issued in Russia. It is illegal to pay for goods and services in foreign currency. You can exchange U.S. dollars at any exchange bureau. Carry new, crisp bills as worn or used U.S. banknotes may not be accepted. In major cities, you can usually exchange Euros and U.S. dollars at various banks.
