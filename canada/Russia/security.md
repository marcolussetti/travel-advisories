# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Armed conflict with Ukraine

There is frequent military activity within Russia’s borders. This includes:

* armed incursions
* shelling
* drone strikes
* explosions
* fires, arsons, and other acts of sabotage

Attacks are most common in areas close to the Russian-Ukrainian border, notably in Bryansk, Kursk and Belgorod oblasts, and in the Black Sea region including Rostov Oblast and Krasnodar Krai. Similar attacks and incidents have also occurred at key infrastructure sites and military installations further into Russia's interior and in cities, including in Moscow and St. Petersburg.

These attacks can lead to sudden and prolonged airspace closures. Military interceptions can also cause collateral damage.

If you are in an area affected by drone or missile strikes:

* identify the location of the closest bomb shelter, if available
* if there are no bomb shelters nearby, shelter in a hardened structure away from windows when air raid warning sirens are active
* follow the advice of local authorities, including air-raid sirens and evacuation orders

Financial transactions involving Canadian or international financial institutions are not possible. This includes withdrawals from ATMs and purchases with credit and bank cards. Availability of essential services may also be affected.

Local authorities scrutinize communications. You may face heavy consequences if you discuss, share or publish information related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Foreign journalists and other media workers in Russia also face considerable risks.

Security conditions are unpredictable and could deteriorate without notice. The ability of our Embassy to provide consular services in Russia may become severely limited.

You may encounter an increased security presence with potential disruptions to transport and movement, especially in areas near Russian military installations. GPS and many navigation systems may not work in Russia.

### Areas bordering Ukraine

The Russian government has declared martial law and maintains a significant military presence in areas bordering Ukraine. This includes the following oblasts:

* Rostov
* Bryansk
* Kursk
* Belgorod
* Voronezh
* Krasnodar

The situation along the Ukrainian border is unpredictable and could change quickly. Exercise extreme vigilance if you must travel to this region.  Armed clashes, drone and missile strikes and military activity pose serious threats to your safety.

If you are currently in this area, you should strongly consider leaving. The ability of the Embassy of Canada in Moscow to provide consular assistance in  areas bordering Ukraine is extremely limited.

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism. Terrorist groups have called for attacks on Russian soil. Incidents resulting in death and injury have occurred most frequently in the North Caucasus region, Moscow and St. Petersburg, but may happen throughout the country. Terrorist attacks could occur at any time.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* cultural venues, including concert halls, nightclubs, and event centres
* places of worship
* Russian airlines, airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

Russian authorities have increased general security measures in Moscow and other large cities. Counter-terrorism operations, curfews, and other restrictions could lead to disruptions with little or no notice.

### North Caucasus Region

The security situation in many areas of the North Caucasus Region is unstable and unpredictable.

#### Republics of Chechnya, Dagestan and Ingushetia, and Stavropol Krai

Terrorist attacks are frequent in the republics of Chechnya, Dagestan and Ingushetia and in the Stavropol region.  Suicide bombings occur on a regular basis and targeted assassinations have also taken place. Unexploded mines and munitions are widespread. Kidnapping for ransom is also common.

You must obtain special permission from the Ministry of the Interior to enter certain areas and regions.

#### Republics of Kabardino-Balkaria (including the Mount Elbrus region), Karachai-Cherkessia and North Ossetia

Tensions are high in Russia’s border regions with Georgia and may affect the security situation in republics of Kabardino-Balkaria, Karachai-Cherkessia and North Ossetia. Military operations are carried out with little or no notice and are accompanied by travel restrictions. Border crossings with Azerbaijan and Georgia are subject to frequent and sometimes lengthy closures.

### Crime

#### Violent crime

Violent crime occurs frequently, sometimes targeting foreigners of non-European descent. Incidences include:

* armed robberies
* assault
* murder

During your stay:

* be aware of your surroundings at all times
* avoid going out after dark
* avoid isolated areas
* don't resist an attack

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and bag snatching, occurs frequently, especially in cities. Criminals, including groups of children and teenagers, use various techniques to distract the victims, including requests for help. In such situations, walk away quickly. Preferred areas for criminals include:

* underground walkways
* buses and trains,
* bus and train stations and airports
* popular tourist areas
* restaurants and public markets
* hotel rooms and residences, even when occupied and locked

During your trip:

* keep your personal belongings, including your passport and your other travel documents in a secure place
* don’t show signs of affluence or wear expensive jewellery
* be aware of your surroundings, especially in busy tourist areas

Replacing travel documents and visas is difficult and could considerably delay your return to Canada.

#### Organized crime

Organized criminal groups are active throughout Russia, particularly in large cities. Extortion and corruption are common business practices, including among foreign businesses. Criminals demand protection money from their victims under threat of serious violence. You should report extortion attempts to Russian authorities.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations occur occasionally. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

Unauthorized demonstrations have occurred across the country since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Many demonstrators have been arrested. If you are close to a demonstration, you may be detained by the Russian authorities for questioning.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for the latest information

### Spiked food and drinks

There are reports of criminals adding drugs into items that could put you at risk of sexual assault or robbery.

Items include:

* food and drink
* gum
* cigarettes
* hand sanitizer
* cosmetics

Incidents are most likely to occur:

* in nightclubs
* in bars and restaurants
* on public transportation, including taxis on the street

While you’re in Russia:

* be wary of accepting these items from new acquaintances
* never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers
* order drinks that come in sealed bottles or cans

### Women’s safety

Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment or verbal abuse.

Sexual assaults occur, including against foreign women.

* Always remain vigilant
* Do not accept offers of transportation from strangers
* Avoid dark alleys and isolated areas
* Keep your hotel doors and windows locked

### Fraud

Foreigners have been scammed in the past when exchanging money on the street.

Traffic police may stop motorists to collect fraudulent cash fines on the spot.

Be cautious when using debit or credit cards:

* only exchange money at major banks
* pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others
* use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

#### Cybercrime

Cybercrime, malware attacks and online extortion are commonplace.

Criminals can compromise public Wi-Fi networks to steal personal data or credit information.

* Be cautious when posting information or photos on social media
* Use your own USB adaptor or carry an extra battery pack
* Use secure public Wi-Fi networks
* Do not discuss travel plans or any other personal information within earshot of strangers

#### Fraudulent police officers

Criminals may also pose as police officers, particularly in St. Petersburg. Real police officers wear a visible personal identification number on their uniforms.

Fake checkpoints may be set up in rural areas to commit robbery.

If you face a similar situation:

* offer to go to the nearest police station
* ask to see police credentials
* remain vigilant
* don’t hand over your money or documents unless you feel threatened
* request to provide your documents or money at the nearest police station, your hotel or another public place

### Surveillance

Local authorities in Russia block access to several:

* websites
* social networks
* search engines
* online services

Don’t assume that your internet connection or past internet activity is private.

Certain Canadian institutions and organizations are treated as “undesirable” by the Russian government. Local authorities may place you under surveillance if they believe you are working with civil society groups that:

* oppose the Russian invasion of Ukraine
* are critical of the Russian state
* advocate for 2SLGBTQI+ persons.

You could also experience surveillance by the authorities simply because you are a foreigner. They may:

* monitor your telecommunications and your location at all times
* review the content stored on your electronic devices
* search your personal possessions or accommodations without your knowledge or consent
* subject you to intense scrutiny at the airport or border crossings, including searches of your personal possessions and telecommunications devices.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

2SLGBTQI+ persons, as well as their allies and families, have been attacked, harassed, and verbally and physically abused. Discrimination and violence targeting 2SLGBTQI+ persons occur, particularly in the North Caucasus republics of Chechnya and Dagestan.

Although the laws of Russia do not prohibit homosexual activity, Russian federal law prohibits public actions that are described as promoting homosexuality and “non-traditional sexual relations.”

Since January 2024, Russian law treats organizations advocating for 2SLGBTQI+ persons or issues as “extremist.” Previous laws banning “LGBT propaganda” and “the international LGBT movement” reflect an increasingly restrictive environment for 2SLGBTQI+ persons and their allies. Actions that contravene or appear to contravene this law may lead to arrest, a fine, jail time and deportation. Examples of such actions include:

* the dissemination of information, for example, through public statements
* public displays of affection.
* displaying symbols associated with 2SLGBTQI+ identities, cultures, or organizations, including flags
* showing or sharing media, including books and advertising, related to 2SLGBTQI+ themes or information

Same sex marriage is not recognized in Russia. Homosexuality isn’t socially accepted. 2SLGBTQI+ travellers should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Russia.

### Telecommunications

If you travel to Russia with a foreign SIM card, you will not be able to access mobile internet, SMS or other services for 24 hours after your arrival. Buying a local-network SIM card in Russia can be difficult for visitors and could take several days to complete. Local authorities maintain control over telecommunications networks and may restrict or suspend access to mobile and internet services during periods of heightened security or major public events.

### Roads

Road safety vary considerably across the country.

Drivers frequently disregard traffic laws and often drive and park in pedestrian areas. Accidents are common. Pedestrians should be particularly careful. In the event of an accident, don’t move the vehicle until the police arrive, even if the car is obstructing traffic.

GPS and other navigation systems, including most maps applications, will not work in Russia. If you plan to travel on the roads, ensure that you have an up-to-date map and plan your trip in advance.

#### Road conditions

Road conditions vary and are often poor outside major cities. Many roads in rural areas are not paved.

Don’t drive after dark.

In winter, road travel can be hazardous due to ice and snow.

### Public transportation

Most major cities have reliable public transportation including buses, subways or streetcars.

#### Train

When travelling by train, store valuables in a safe place and don’t leave the compartment unattended. Lock the door from the inside.

#### Taxis

There are reports of assault and robbery in unregistered taxis. Only use officially marked taxis

* Book taxis in advance from reputable companies either by phone or through taxi company apps
* Confirm the fare in advance
* Never share a taxi with strangers

### Marine transportation

Boat accidents are common due to the overloading and poor maintenance of some vessels. Safety standards differ from those in Canada.

* Exercise caution and common sense when using marine transportation
* Don’t board vessels that appear overloaded or unseaworthy

### Power outages

Power outages and shortages occur frequently throughout Russia.

Not all buildings are equipped with generators. Keep a supply of water, food, fuel and an emergency kit on hand.

### Air travel

We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.
