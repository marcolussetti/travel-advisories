## Natural disasters and climate

Tunisia is prone to various natural disasters, such as:

* drought
* bad weather
* sand and dust storms
* earthquakes

Temperatures vary both geographically and seasonally. In the north, summers are hot and dry, and winters are rainy.  In the south, the climate is semi-arid, and it can get very hot in the Sahara, especially in the summer. Between June and September, temperatures can exceed 40°C, and sand and dust storms are frequent.

### Drought

Severe droughts can last for several years, reducing water supplies.

During dry periods:

* always keep water supplies on hand
* follow the instructions of local authorities

### Rainy season

In northern Tunisia, the rainy season generally extends from October to May. In the south, rainfall is significantly less frequent due to the arid climate. In the winter, downpours can block roads.

Seasonal flooding can hamper overland travel and the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable and bridges damaged.

* Monitor local media for updates, including road conditions
* Stay away from flooded areas
* Monitor weather reports
* Follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders

### Sand and dust storms

Sand and dust storms are common.

During a sand or dust storm :

* stay indoors
* keep windows closed
* be prepared to modify, interrupt or cancel your trip at any time
* monitor local media for the latest information

### Earthquakes

Although Tunisia is not located in a high-risk zone for earthquakes, small tremors do occasionally occur.
