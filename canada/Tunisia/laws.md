### Child custody

A child born to a Tunisian mother or father can be considered by the Tunisian authorities as a Tunisian citizen, no matter where he or she was born and what other citizenship he or she has acquired.

In cases where one or more family members hold Tunisian citizenship, parents should consider the risks before their children travel to Tunisia, including that:

* at the request of family members, Tunisian authorities can prevent children from leaving Tunisia (a procedure known as a “stop order”)
* Canadian children who are identified as Tunisian citizens will be treated as Tunisian nationals

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Tunisia.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Tunisia by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Tunisia to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

ATMs are widely available in tourist areas and can be found in all major centres.  Many establishments in urban and tourist areas accept credit cards.

There are restrictions on the import and export of foreign currency. You must declare all foreign currency in your possession equal to or superior to the equivalent of 20,000 TND:

* upon arrival
* upon departure
* in transit

If you enter Tunisia with a sum exceeding 5,000 TND, you must declare the amount to airport customs so that the exceeding sum is not confiscated when you leave the country.

In the event of confiscation upon leaving, you must request a refund using a form available on the Tunisian customs website.

In addition, you will not be able to leave Tunisia with the equivalent of 30,000 TND or more, even if you declared it upon entry.

These rules apply to non-residents.

Residents of Tunisia may obtain a conversion allowance of up to 6000 TND in foreign currency per calendar year under certain conditions.

However, in order to leave the country as a resident with foreign currency in your possession, you must:

* declare all foreign currency you are carrying
* provide official proof to the customs authorities of the allowance obtained

If you’re travelling to Tunisia, you should:

* familiarize yourself with the regulations before you travel
* declare any foreign currency in your possession upon entry
* keep your declaration until you leave
* exchange foreign currency at recognized banks or exchange offices only
* plan accordingly

Foreign currency declarations apply to:

* bank notes
