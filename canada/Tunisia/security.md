# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Demonstrations, strikes and civil unrest

Demonstrations and strikes occur occasionally, particularly to denounce the deterioration of economic, political and social conditions in Tunisia. They sometimes lead to civil unrest and clashes with the security forces. Although demonstrations take place throughout the country, they are mainly concentrated in downtown Tunis.

 Strikes in transportation and public services occur occasionnally. Rail, sea, air and public transport services could therefore be affected. There are reports of shortages of fuel and certain foodstuffs.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism.

On May 9, 2023, a shooting took place near the Ghriba synagogue on the island of Djerba, resulting in several casualties. This attack took place despite an increased presence of security forces as part of the annual Lag Ba'omer pilgrimage.

Terrorists have previously targeted resorts and tourist attractions, as well as government and military installations. Individuals suspected of terrorism or arms trafficking have been captured in various parts of the country, including Tunis. The presence of extremist groups and regional instability pose a threat to the safety of foreigners, religious sites and tourist facilities. Security forces are on constant alert and conduct anti-terrorist operations throughout the country to prevent attacks.

Despite the preventive efforts of security forces, terrorist acts could occur at any time. Targets could include :

* government buildings
* schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks;
* public places such as tourist attractions, stadiums, restaurants, bars, cafés, shopping malls, markets, hotels and other places frequented by foreigners.

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

Be especially vigilant at:

* sporting events
* religious holidays
* public celebrations
* major political events, such as elections.

Terrorists may use such occasions to mount attacks.

### Zones with military presence

The Tunisian authorities have designated certain areas as “ military operations zones ”, where the army patrols to counter terrorist threats and attacks. These zones mainly include the central-western mountain ranges in the governorates of Kasserine and Kef, including :

* Mount Chaambi
* Mount Mghila
* Mount Selloum
* Mount Sammama

Avoid all travel to fenced-off military zones such as the area south of the city of Remada, in the governorate of Tataouine. The Tunisian armed forces could arrest you if you enter without prior authorization.

### Border regions

#### Algeria

Due to the movement of suspected terrorist cell members, militants and smugglers between Tunisia and neighboring countries, the Tunisian government has increased the presence of its armed forces on the border with Algeria. However, the threat of cross-border terrorist activity remains, and attacks still target the Tunisian armed forces.

There is a risk of terrorist attacks and kidnappings along the Algerian border, particularly in the mountainous regions of the following governorates:

* Jendouba
* Kef
* Kasserine

Improvised explosive devices (IEDs) have been found in these areas. The Algerian and Tunisian armed forces carry out joint anti-terrorist operations on both sides of the border, notably in the governorates of Jendouba, Kasserine and Kef.

#### Libya

Deteriorating security conditions and the presence of terrorist groups in Libya continue to have an impact on the security situation along the border with Tunisia. There is a strong presence of Tunisian armed forces on the border with Libya, notably to control the passage of migrants to and from Libya, as well as from the Mediterranean Sea.

The border between Tunisia and Libya may close at any time for an indefinite period.

### State of emergency

The state of emergency has been in effect in Tunisia since 2015 and is regularly extended due to the threat of terrorism.

Security forces have increased rights to:

* conduct searches
* make seizures
* detain persons of interest
* impose curfews

If you are traveling to a place where a state of emergency is in effect:

* be aware that you may be subject to searches by security forces
* always cooperate with military and police officers
* carry valid ID at all times and be prepared for various checkpoints
* allow extra time to reach your destination
* follow the instructions of local authorities
* monitor local media for the latest information

### Kidnappings

Although the risk is low, kidnappings may occur, particularly along border areas.

During your stay :

* report any suspicious behavior to security forces
* exercise caution at all times

### Sports events

Sports events sometimes give rise to rowdy behavior and violent incidents.

Be careful if you attend sports events.

### Crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs occasionally, especially in tourist areas.

A rise in crimes of opportunity is also reported across the country and particularly in Tunis, including:

* burglaries
* muggings

During your stay :

* exercise caution
* keep your personal belongings, including your passport and your other travel documents in a secure place
* don’t show signs of affluence or wear expensive jewellery
* avoid walking alone after dark
* avoid isolated areas

### Women’s safety

Women travelling alone can be subject to offensive verbal and sexual abuse and behaviour.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

2SLGBTQI+ persons can be victims of discrimination, harassment and acts of violence based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression or sexual characteristics.

There are reports of 2SLGBTQI+ people being harassed online, particularly for taking part in events related to 2SLGBTQI+ issues. In some cases, their personal information is revealed on social media, where individuals call for violence against them.

Security forces sometimes carry out arbitrary arrests and illegal searches and use violence and blackmail to force people to hand over their phones and belongings. This information may be used as evidence in legal proceedings.

If you are a victim of violence or detained by local authorities due to your sexual orientation, gender identity or any other sexual characteristic, you should report it immediately to the Canadian Embassy in Tunisia.

Tunisian law criminalizes sexual acts between individuals of the same sex.

2SLGBTQI+ persons could be arrested because of their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression or sexual characteristics. They could also be arrested and face other charges such as:

* public indecency
* offence to public morality

Convicted offenders face fines and prison sentences ranging from six months to three years.

2SLGBTQI+ persons should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Tunisia.

### Fraud

Fraud related to online shopping occurs in Tunisia.

There have been several reports of products ordered online, including on social media, which do not correspond to the description given. Individuals trying to obtain compensation face phone numbers that are no longer in service or online pages that no longer exist.

* Avoid shopping on unencrypted websites
* Beware of overly attractive business opportunities
* Don't give your banking information to strangers

In some resorts, young Tunisians are looking to marry older Canadians either to enrich themselves or to come to Canada.

Keep in mind that you could be the victim of a scam if strangers or new acquaintances bring up the subject of marriage.

### Road safety

#### Driving habits

The number of road accidents is rising in Tunisia, despite awareness campaigns.

Roads are busy during the summer vacations, particularly between July and mid-September.

Many accidents are caused by drivers' dangerous behavior, including :

* speeding
* sudden lane changes
* drinking and driving
* driving at night without headlights
* distractions
* failure to comply with road signs

Bicycles, electric scooters and motorcycles are not always equipped with reflectors or headlights, and often zigzag between cars.

In some isolated areas, emergency services may be limited and response times may be longer.

#### Road conditions

Outside major cities, roads can be dangerous for various reasons, including :

* uneven surfaces
* lack of infrastructure maintenance
* potholes
* insufficient lighting

Pedestrians sometimes walk in the street due to the absence of sidewalks, and often weave in and out of cars to cross the street. Vehicles don't always stop at crosswalks or when the light is red at an intersection.

Police officers often intercept cars for inspection, especially rental cars.

If you drive in Tunisia :

* exercise caution
* always drive defensively
* be very careful if you travel after dark
* only use main roads and highways
* fill your gas tank before you travel, especially if you're traveling to remote areas
* avoid stopping in isolated areas

In remote areas, including the area south of Jebil National Park and in desert zones, cell phone reception is not always reliable and resources for obtaining assistance are limited.

### Public transportation

#### Taxis

Yellow taxis are generally available, but few are equipped with working seatbelts. You can hail a taxi on the street or order one via a mobile app that indicates the fare, which is usually higher.

Taxis generally only accept payment in cash.

#### Buses

City buses are crowded and regularly behind schedule. Crime, especially petty crime, can occur on board.

#### Trains

Petty crime, such as purse snatching, can occur on trains. Derailments and collisions occur every year.

Intercity trains and buses are considered more reliable, but safety standards may differ from those in Canada.

When using public transportation:

* avoid storing bags in the overhead compartment or under your seat
* always carry your valuables and identification with you

### Air travel

We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.
