## Safety and security

### Demonstrations in Luanda

Demonstrations and strikes by taxi drivers are taking place in Luanda from July 28 to July 30, 2025.

Incidents of violence have occurred, including attacks on app-based taxis and public buses, as well as looting and civil disorder.

Gatherings and demonstrations may also occur after these dates.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at anytime. They can also lead to disruption of traffic and public transportation.

Authorities may restrict movement without notice.

If you are in Luanda:

* limit non-essential movements
* stay away from demonstrations
* avoid areas around government buildings
* expect increased security presence
* monitor local media for the latest information
* follow the instructions of local authorities

### Province of Cabinda

Militant groups claiming independence are active in this province and clashes with security forces are possible.

Murders, kidnappings and sexual assaults occur and foreigners have been targeted. These militant groups have indicated their intention to continue to conduct attacks on foreigners.

Access to basic goods and services in Cabinda is restricted.

### Province of Lunda Norte

The presence of foreigners in diamond-producing Lunda Norte may create tension. Security forces engaged in the expulsion of illegal diamond miners may be suspicious of foreign observers.

The presence of diamonds increases levels of crime. Travellers may be asked for a letter from their employer, an organization or an individual explaining the reasons for their travel.

Access to basic goods and services in Lunda Norte is restricted.

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing, bag snatching and theft from vehicles occurs regularly, including in Luanda.

Theft is common in:

* popular tourist areas
* near or inside ATMs and banks
* outside the arrivals and departures gates at the Luanda airport

During your trip:

* ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* avoid showing signs of affluence or wearing expensive jewellery
* pay attention to your surroundings, particularly in crowded and tourist areas
* keep your car doors and windows locked at all times
* avoid carrying large sums of cash or unnecessary valuables
* be extra cautious when withdrawing cash from ATMs and banks

#### Violent crime

Violent crime occurs, especially in Luanda. Incidents include:

* muggings, particularly for mobile phones
* armed robberies
* carjacking, usually of four wheel drive and luxury vehicles
* rape

During your stay:

* remain aware of your surroundings at all times
* if threatened by armed individuals, don’t resist and hand over your cash and valuables immediately
* avoid walking after dark
* avoid walking alone

### Cybercrime

Cybercrime, malware attacks and online extortion occur in Angola.

Criminals can compromise public Wi-Fi networks in order to steal personal data or credit information.

Cybercriminals can monitor social media and listen to your phone conversations.

* Avoid using public Wi-Fi networks
* Avoid shopping on unencrypted websites
* Be cautious when posting information on social media
* Be wary of unsolicited emails offering attractive business opportunities

### Landmines

There is a high risk from landmines and unexploded ordnance, especially near bridges and on unpaved roads outside major cities. Many areas of the countryside, including secondary roads, are heavily mined. Even frequently travelled roads that are thought to be landmine-free may be unsafe.

### Road safety

Roads, particularly secondary and tertiary roads, and bridges are generally in poor condition.

Incidents of drivers under the influence of alcohol are common, especially on weekends. The return trip to Luanda from beach outings can be particularly hazardous due to reckless driving habits. Be extremely careful of unexpected hazards on the road, such as pedestrians and animals.

Always drive with the doors locked and the windows rolled up. Keep your valuables out of sight.

Only undertake overland travel outside of urban centres in convoys of at least two vehicles, ideally four-wheel drive vehicles.

### Public transportation

Door-to-door taxis are scarce and expensive, so you should try to hire a car with driver. Local drivers can overcome the problem of few parking spaces and can negotiate heavy traffic and the idiosyncrasies of local traffic flows, including any accident.

Avoid using public transportation, including buses and van taxis.

### Shortages

Shortages of fuel, municipal water and power may occur. Drinking water and some food items can be difficult to find sometimes. Plan accordingly. Ensure that your emergency kit is complete.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations occur occasionally.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Domestic travel

Be careful at all times and carry locally certified copies of the identification page of your passport as well as original travel documents issued by Angolan authorities, such as resident or work permits, visas and a driver’s licence. Make sure your documents are up-to-date. Police checkpoints are common in both urban and rural areas. You should be prepared to present copies of your identification documents. Do not challenge the authority of requesting officials. Failure to produce identification documents can result in a large fine.

When travelling in the provinces, always carry original documentation. If photocopies are to be used in place of originals, the copies must be notarized by an Angolan notary public. Note that notarized photocopies are not acceptable for travel outside Luanda.

Foreigners travelling into the interior of Angola sometimes require an internal travel document. This may be provided by the Angolan organization or individual that invited the foreigner to Angola.

### Telecommunications

Interruptions in telecommunications are common. International calls are difficult to place from outside the capital. Most personal cellular phones are incompatible and must be reprogrammed for use within Angola.

### Piracy

Pirate attacks and armed robbery against ships occur in coastal waters. Mariners should take appropriate precautions.
