Some handicrafts considered of cultural value may be retained by customs. It is illegal to remove turtle shells and ivory from the country.

Avoid photographing airports, major roads, bridges, communications installations, military personnel and government buildings. Taking photos of urban areas may be frowned upon by police.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Angola does not prohibit sexual acts between persons of the same sex. However, homosexuality is not widely socially accepted.

Same-sex marriage is not recognized.

2SLGBTQI+ persons should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Angola.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Angola.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Angola by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Angola to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Money

The currency in Angola is the kwanza (AOA).

The kwanza is not convertible on the international market. Dollars can be converted into kwanzas, or vice versa, at the few exchange bureaus in Luanda or at local banks. Receiving foreign currency is often very difficult due to present scarcity (even for those with foreign currency accounts). Kwanzas cannot be taken out of the country. No more than US$15,000 can be taken into or out of Angola, unless an official declaration is made upon entry.

Newer U.S.-dollar bills are preferred, due to the ease with which the older bills are counterfeited. Credit cards are accepted at only a few of Luandaâ€™s largest hotels and restaurants, and it varies as to which cards are accepted. VISA is the most commonly accepted credit card. Leave a copy of your card information with a trusted family member or friend in case of emergency.

ATMs dispense kwanzas only. Some ATMs in Luanda accept VISA cards, but only to withdraw kwanzas. Note that machines often malfunction or run out of cash. Debit cards do not work.
