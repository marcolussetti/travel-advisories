### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Paraguay.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of Paraguay, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Paraguay.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Paraguay, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Paraguayan court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Paraguay to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Investments

Disputes related to property acquisition or other investments are costly and take time to resolve.

If you plan on buying property, or making other investments in Paraguay:

* seek legal advice in Canada and in Paraguay before making commitments
* choose your own lawyer
* avoid hiring a lawyer recommended by a seller

### Driving

Penalties for drinking and driving are severe.

The legal blood alcohol limit is 0.00%.  There are regular police checks to perform breathalyzer tests. If a police officer suspects you of drinking and driving, they could confiscate your driver's licence on the spot. If you’re convicted, you can expect heavy fines.

Police regularly stop cars to check vehicle and driving documents. You should ensure you rent a car from a reputable company and you sign a rental contract that includes car insurance.

You must carry an international driving permit.

Traffic regulation is different from Canada as the legal age to drive is 18.

### Identification

 Local authorities may request to see your ID at any time.

* Carry valid identification or a photocopy of it at all times
* Keep a photocopy of your passport in a safe place in case it’s lost or seized
* Keep a digital copy of your ID and travel documents

### Hunting

It is illegal to hunt in Paraguay. Convicted offenders can expect jail sentences and heavy fines.

### Money

The currency of Paraguay is the guaraní (PYG).

You may be requested to show ID when paying with a credit or debit card.

Paying with credit or with debit card is rarely accepted in the Chaco region.

Canadian currency is not widely accepted. Only new US$ 100 bills can be exchanged.  Use registered banks and exchange bureaus as fake bank notes are common.
