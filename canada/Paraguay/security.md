## Safety and security

### Crime

#### Petty Crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs frequently across the country.

Criminals have been known to observe, follow and then rob victims who have made withdrawals at ATMs.

Crime rates are higher in Asunción and greater Asunción neighbourhoods of:

* Chacarita
* Fernando de la Mora
* Limpio
* Luque
* Mariano Roque Alonso
* Nemby
* San Lorenzo
* Villa Elisa

During your trip:

* ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* avoid showing signs of wealth
* avoid carrying large sums of cash or unnecessary valuables
* avoid walking alone after dark
* be extra cautious when withdrawing cash from ATMs
* if you're robbed, hand over cash, electronic devices and valuables without resistance
* don't leave bags, luggage or other valuable items in the car, and never in plain view
* keep your vehicle windows closed and doors locked at all times, especially if stopped

#### Violent crime

Violent crime is known to occur.

Incidents include, namely:

* armed robberies
* burglary
* car jacking

Muggings by armed motorcyclists can occur day or night.

Robbers sometimes dress as service people to gain access to homes. Do not let servicepeople in unless you have a confirmed appointment.

#### Illegal armed groups

Violent crime by illegal armed groups has increased throughout the country in recent years.

Drug and arms trafficking operate along the Tri-border area of:

* Paraguay
* Brazil, especially from Pedro Juan Caballero to Ciudad del Este along Paraguay’s eastern border
* Argentina

Drugs and arms smuggling pose security threats in the departments of:

* Amambay
* Altó Paraná
* Canindeyú

A small armed guerrilla group known as Ejército del Pueblo Paraguayo (Paraguayan people’s army - EPP) has kidnapped for a ransom. It operates in:

* the northern part of the department of San Pedro
* the southern part of the department of Concepción
* Canindeyú and Amambay departments in the east

Although the EPP typically targets residents rather than visitors, be extra cautious if you travel to these areas.

Illegal armed groups pose a risk to travellers. Tourists are not usually targeted, but you could find yourself in the wrong place at the wrong time.

### Virtual kidnappings

Virtual Kidnappings may occur. An individual or criminal organization contacts you by phone and demands immediate payment for the return of a “kidnapped” family member or friend. No actual kidnapping takes place.

Criminals use various means of gathering information about potential victims, including using social media sites or eavesdropping on conversations.

If you are perceived to be wealthy, you could be at risk.

### Spiked food and drinks

Snacks, beverages, gum and cigarettes may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

* Be wary of accepting these items from new acquaintances
* Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations and road blockades occur occasionally. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* follow the instructions of local authorities
* monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Paraguay’s law does not prohibit sexual acts between individuals of the same sex. However, homosexuality is not widely socially accepted and public displays of affection are not socially acceptable.  

2SLGBTQI+ persons could be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or sex characteristics.

### Water shortages

Interruptions to the water supply occur occasionally, including in Asunción. Water shortages can last for weeks in the region of Chaco and drinking water may be difficult to find.

If you’re in Paraguay:

* keep supplies of bottled water and water purification tablets on hand
* expect limits on the availability of drinkable water
* monitor local media to stay informed of the evolving situation

### Food shortages

Food shortages may occur, particularly in Chaco region.

* Plan accordingly

Power outages could impact some essential services, such as:

* public transportation, including flights
* medical services
* the public water supply
* telecommunications
* banking transactions
* the purchase of basic necessities

### Fuel shortages

Gas stations are rare in the Chaco region. If you are driving in this area:

* always carry a cell phone, power banks, chargers and a list of emergency numbers handy
* keep a sufficient supply of water, food, medication and fuel on hand for several days
* follow the instructions of local authorities

### Telecommunications networks

Mobile telephone services outside urban areas could be limited.

### Swimming

Rivers can be dangerous as many have strong currents. Do not swim in the River Paraguay, which is highly polluted. Toxic dumping in rivers is commonly practiced and poses a health risk to swimmers.

* Never swim alone
* Always maintain a safe distance from boats and restricted areas
* Consult residents and tour operators for information on possible hazards and safe swimming areas
* Don't dive in unfamiliar waters as hidden rocks or shallow water can cause serious injury or death

### Adventure tourism

Because of heavy rainfall and limited infrastructure, you should carefully plan your hiking trips to remote areas.

The Chaco wilderness is a harsh environment where you may encounter dangerous animals.

If you intend on hiking:

* never do so alone
* always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company and make accommodations arrangements in advance
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* ensure that you’re properly equipped and well-informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary, including when you expect to be back to camp
* refrain from using facilities or equipment if you have doubts on their safety
* obtain detailed information on trekking routes before setting out and do not venture off marked trails

### Indigenous peoples

Visiting most areas populated by indigenous peoples should present no danger, apart from the northern area of Chaco Paraguayo, where the Ayoreo woodland group lives. Some Ayoreos may perceive outsiders as a threat.

### Road safety

Road safety is poor throughout the country. Road accidents have increased over the past few years, especially with motorcycles. The number of traffic accidents tends to increase during the holiday season from December to January. There is no roadside assistance on most highways.

Driving is also dangerous due to:

* lack of traffic signs
* large potholes
* insufficient lighting or poorly functioning traffic lights
* stray animals
* poorly maintained vehicles, some without proper lights
* drivers not always respecting traffic laws

Avoid driving at night.

#### Road conditions

Outside of highways, most roads are not paved.

Driving conditions may be hazardous during the rainy season, December to April.

### Public transportation

Public transportation is readily available for urban and intercity travel.

#### Buses

Vehicles lack maintenance and safety equipment. Bus accidents are frequent. Buses travel through high-crime areas leaving you at risk of theft.

#### Taxis

Taxis are considered safe but often do not have functioning seat belts.

Taxis are available at marked taxi stops.

* Ask for your cab at the front test if you are using hotel services
* Note the driver’s name on his or her photo identification card and license number

#### Ride-sharing apps

Ride-sharing apps are available in Paraguay.
