### El Niño

The complex weather phenomenon called El Niño happens at irregular intervals of 2 to 7 years. El Niño generally generates heavy rainfalls, occurring at the same time as the rainy season from December to March.

* Keep informed of regional weather forecasts before and during your travels, and plan accordingly.
* Ensure you have adequate insurance to cover the consequences of such events, including the disruption of travel plans.

### Rainy season

The rainy season extends from December to March. The eastern part of the country is more at risks to floods.

* Monitor local media and weather reports for the latest updates, including those on road conditions
* Stay away from flooded areas
