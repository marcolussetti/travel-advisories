# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

The authorities of a country or territory decide who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from South African authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 30 days beyond the date you expect to leave South Africa. Your passport must contain at least 2 empty visa pages for the necessary South African entry stamp and/or visa. Without it, you will be denied entry into the country.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with a “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

You should also be aware that current systems used by some countries and travel companies may not recognize the “X” gender identifier. You may still be asked to provide your sex/gender information as either male or female when travelling.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Visas

Tourist visa: not required for stays up to 90 days  
Business visa: not required for stays up to 90 days  
Volunteer visa: required  
Student visa: required  
Employment visa: required

Canadians do not need a tourist visa to enter South Africa. Immigration officials will stamp your passport upon arrival and grant you a specific number of days to stay in South Africa, to a maximum of 90 days. Make sure the duration indicated on your entry stamp matches your travel plans, as permission for a full 90-day stay is not automatically granted.

#### Changing or extending your visa

If you need to change your visa or extend your stay while in South Africa, you must schedule an appointment through VFS Global, the official service provider authorized by the South African Department of Home Affairs.

Overstaying without proper authorization may result in a ban from re-entering South Africa for up to 5 years.

If you leave and re-enter South Africa, even for a short time, you will not automatically be given permission to stay for an additional 90 days. Immigration officials can deny you re-entry into South Africa or grant you a stay of less than 90 days.

#### Work, volunteer or study

If you intend to work, volunteer or study in South Africa, you must apply for the relevant visas prior to your arrival; otherwise, you risk being refused entry and may be returned to your point of origin.

### Other entry requirements

You must be in possession of a return or an onward ticket. Without one, you may be required to deposit the equivalent of a fare home with customs. The money will be refunded after departure from South Africa.

### Residence permit

If you reside in South Africa, you must have valid residence permit in your passport each time you enter or exit the country.

### Entry and exit requirements for dual citizens

Dual citizens must enter or depart South Africa using their South African passport only.

This requirement applies to individuals who lost their South African citizenship between October 1995 and May 2025 by acquiring another nationality, as the Constitutional Court has ruled that they are now deemed to have retained their South African citizenship.

For further information on dual citizenship, contact the High Commission for the Republic of South Africa in Ottawa or the Consulate General in Toronto.

### Children and travel

Unaccompanied minors under the age of 18 traveling to and from South Africa are subject to additional requirements.

All minors holding South African citizenship, including dual citizens, are also subject to additional requirements. Visit the South African Department of Home Affairs website or contact the nearest South African mission, before travelling, to verify the latest requirements.
