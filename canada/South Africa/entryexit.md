# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from South African authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 30 days beyond the date you expect to leave South Africa. Your passport must contain at least 2 empty visa pages for the necessary South African Temporary Residence Permit. Without it, you will be denied entry into the country.

You may also be denied boarding at the point of departure if you don’t have enough blank pages for the visa. If you plan to visit neighbouring countries and return to South Africa, ensure that there are sufficient visa pages in your passport for those countries’ visas and those of South Africa.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Visas

Tourist visa: not required for stays up to 90 days  
Business visa: not required for stays up to 90 days  
Student permit: required  
Employment permit: required

Canadians don't need a tourist visa to enter South Africa. However, upon arrival, immigration officials will issue a temporary residents visa (TRV) for up to 90 days. Check the expiry date of your TRV to ensure you don’t overstay.

If you overstay without authority, you may be forced to pay a fine upon departure and/or can be refused entry for up to 5 years.

Serious offenders may be arrested before departure and detained until their court appearance. In such cases, visitors may face a very substantial fine and be deported at their own expense.

#### Changing or extending your visa

Some foreigners travelling to South Africa have not gone through the correct channels to obtain, change or extend their relevant visas. This has resulted in arrest and detention due to fraudulently issued visas.

While in South Africa, you must go through regional or district offices of the South African Department of Home Affairs for information on visa requirements and issuance.

#### Regional travel

If you leave and re-enter South Africa, even for a short time, you will not automatically be given an additional 90-day visitor’s visa. An immigration official can deny you re-entry into South Africa. The immigration officer can also allow you to enter for a limited time only.

If you wish to extend your stay, contact the South African Department of Home Affairs 60 days before your visitor’s visa expires.

#### Work or study

If you intend to work or study in South Africa, you must apply for the relevant visas prior to your arrival; otherwise, you risk being refused entry and may be returned to your point of origin. You cannot change the type of visa once in South Africa.

### Other entry requirements

You must be in possession of a return or an onward ticket. Without one, you may be required to deposit the equivalent of a fare home with customs. The money will be refunded after departure from South Africa.

### Residence permit

If you reside in South Africa, you must have valid residence permit in your passport each time you enter and leave the country.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizens must enter or depart South Africa using their South African passport only.

For further information on dual citizenship, contact the High Commission for the Republic of South Africa in Ottawa.

### Children and travel

Minors traveling to and from South Africa must have a valid passport and may be subject to additional requirements.

You must produce a long form birth certificate when travelling with children under the age of 18 to neighbouring countries. The long form birth certificate must be in English or translated into English.

Contact the nearest South African mission abroad or visit the South African Department of Home Affairs website, before travelling, to verify the latest requirements.
