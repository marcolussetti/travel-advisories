## Natural disasters and climate

South Africa is currently experiencing severe weather events. The South African Weather Service issued several high-level alerts for parts of Limpopo, Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal provinces, which are significantly impacted by flooding.

Parts of Kruger National Park are closed, including some entrances and camps. The number of visitors allowed per day is limited.

There may be travel disruptions due to weather, including flight cancellations and airport closures.

Several wildfires are currently active in the Western Cape province.

If you are in or near the affected areas:

* exercise caution

### Climate change

Climate change is affecting South Africa. Extreme and unusual weather events are becoming more frequent and may affect your travel plans. Monitor local media for the latest information.

### Rainstorms

The climate varies from region to region with storms and flooding possible at different times throughout the year.

In Gauteng and Northwest Provinces, flash storms occur from November to April.

KwaZulu-Natal typically experiences heavy rainfall from October to April. However, flash floods are becoming increasingly frequent outside these periods.

Western Cape typically receives heavy rainfall between May and September.

During periods of heavy rain, dirt roads can become hazardous, especially in rural or mountainous areas. Crossing low-lying river bridges, whether by car or on foot, should be avoided, as there have been fatalities linked to people being swept away by fast-moving waters.

### Wildfires

Veld (bush) fires are common during dry seasons. They are very unpredictable and extremely dangerous. They can spread very quickly and travel at speeds of 60 km/h or more due to high winds. Stay clear of active fires and always verify local conditions with relevant authorities before going on bush walks, particularly during the dry seasons.

### Drought

The entire territory can be affected by drought, which has become increasingly severe and prolonged in recent years. During periods of prolonged drought, local authorities may impose water use restrictions. You could be fined if you do not comply with these restrictions.
