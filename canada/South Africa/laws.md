### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and South Africa.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in South Africa, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the South African court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in South Africa to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Driving

While you may drive in South Africa with your valid Canadian driver’s license, it is strongly recommended to obtain an International Driving Permit (IDP) in Canada before your departure, since it cannot be obtained once in South Africa.

Without an IDP, it can be extremely difficult to obtain car insurance for rentals or vehicle purchases. Insurance companies and rental car agencies often require an IDP or South African driver’s license to honour insurance claims, even if such proof was not requested when purchasing the insurance policy.

If your license is in French, it is advisable to obtain a translation into English and carry it with you.

Foreigners driving a rental car across any border into neighboring countries must obtain a permit from the Cross-border Road Transport Agency before reaching the border crossing. Applications can be submitted through most car rental agencies, online or in person at Cross-border Road Transport Agency in Pretoria. Failure to do so may lead to arrest and/or a fine.

### Identification

Local authorities may request to see your identification at any time.

* Always carry certified photocopies of your official identification
* Keep a photocopy of your passport and your entry stamp, visa or travel permit in a safe place in case it’s lost or seized

### Money

The currency is the South African rand (ZAR).

Canadian currency can be easily exchanged at major banks and foreign exchange counters. A passport and additional identification are required when undertaking foreign exchange transactions.

Foreigners may enter South Africa carrying up to ZAR 25 000, or USD 10,000 or its equivalent in foreign currencies without declaring it.
