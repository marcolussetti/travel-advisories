## Safety and security

### Outages

Nationwide power shortages or rolling blackouts, referred to as load shedding, are still occurring regularly. They are occurring numerous times a day and for multiple-hour stretches.

Though the potential for a nationwide blackout is low, the associated risks are high, including a nationwide loss of power for days or weeks.

South Africa has already experienced blackouts for up to 12 hours in a 24 hour period. Increased demand for power during the coldest winter months of June and July means that blackouts could last longer. Expect a dark and cold winter.

An official schedule of the planned blackouts provides advance notice of the shortages. However, they can also occur with very little notice.

Blackouts could increase the risk of criminal activity in affected areas, which could in turn lead to opportunistic theft and prolonged outages.

Blackouts can affect the following services and businesses:

* telecommunications and security systems
* stores and food supply
* hotels and other accommodations
* banks and ATMs
* gas stations
* public lighting and traffic lights

Interruptions to water supply occur occasionally and can be lengthy in some areas, causing considerable inconvenience.

If you’re in South Africa:

* be prepared for extended power outages
* make sure you always have a complete emergency kit on hand, including several flashlights
* always carry a cell phone, power banks, chargers and a list of emergency numbers handy
* keep a sufficient supply of water, food, medication and fuel on hand for several days
* keep your travel documents up-to-date
* monitor local media
* follow the instructions of local authorities

### Crime

#### Violent crime

South Africa has a very high level of crime. Crime is the primary security threat to travellers.

Violent crimes, including rape and murder, occur frequently and have involved foreigners.

Muggings, armed assaults and theft are also frequent, often occurring in areas that are popular among tourists. Carjackings, robbery and assault also occur.

Armed robberies at shopping malls occur. To minimize the risk of personal assault if confronted by an armed individual:

* immediately comply
* avoid making sudden movements
* avoid resisting or antagonizing the assailants
* avoid eye contact with your assailant

Crime significantly increases after dark in major city centres and townships. After dark, avoid the areas of:

* Berea
* Hillbrow and Yeoville in Johannesburg
* Sunnyside in Pretoria
* the beachfront and Victoria wharf in Durban
* Cape Town downtown hotels to the waterfront

#### Crimes of opportunity

There is a high risk of pickpocketing. You should not carry your wallet in your back pocket.

Do not show signs of affluence, display money or carry valuables such as laptop computers or cameras.

When at restaurants or bars, do not leave your bag under your chair or table or hung over the back of a chair; keep it on your lap.

Ensure that all your bags’ zippers, straps and fasteners are closed and secure, and be aware of people behind and around you.

Criminals are known to target people who appear distracted and are not paying attention to their immediate surroundings.

If you believe that you are being followed, go directly to a police station.

#### Crime in and around airports

Passengers have been followed upon arrival at airports and then robbed either on their way to or once they arrived at their final destination. There are also reports of theft from checked luggage.

Some areas around Cape Town International Airport are less secure. There are reports of an increased risk of attack on secondary roads near the airport.

When travelling to and from an airport:

* stay on highways and main roads
* avoid shortcuts
* if you are using a GPS, make sure that the itinerary avoid townships and secondary roads
* plan your trip in advance and verify your travel itinerary with a trusted local source
* consider arranging an airport transfer

#### On the road

Be vigilant at vulnerable points such as:

* traffic lights
* stop signs
* yield signs
* highway off-ramps

Smash and grab incidents are frequent. This is when car windows are broken and valuables such as handbags are taken while cars are waiting at junctions.

* Park in well-lit areas
* Do not pick up strangers
* Ensure that vehicle doors are locked and windows are closed at all times

#### Hotel theft

Theft from hotel rooms and guest houses is common. Never leave your windows or doors open or unlocked, even when you are present.

* Check the level of security at guest houses, hotels, lodges, backpacker lodges or any accommodation before making bookings
* Don’t leave luggage and valuables unattended; place them in safekeeping facilities
* Don’t open the door to anyone without taking necessary precautions. If someone claims to be a member of staff, verify with the reception prior to opening the door

### Police officer impersonation

Criminals may pose as police officers to extort or rob tourists. There are reports that criminals use fake IDs and flashing blue lights to stop cars with the intent to rob the passengers or steal the vehicle.

If you face this situation:

* do not stop your vehicle
* put on your hazard lights and continue to the nearest police station or secure location

### Kidnapping

There is a threat of kidnapping across South Africa. Foreign nationals have been kidnapped in the past. Kidnappings are generally for financial gain or motivated by criminality.

Scammers could kidnap you to extort money from your loved ones in exchange for your release.

* Be wary of online romance, employment and money scams
* Never accept an invitation to travel to an unfamiliar location
* If you think you've been scammed, do not travel overseas to get your money back

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations can occur anywhere across the country and sometimes on short notice. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Fraud

Cases of attempted fraud are frequently reported in South Africa. Do not give personal or financial account information to anyone.

Don’t attempt to use ATMs that appear damaged or defective, or are in isolated or poorly lit areas. Don’t accept any offer of assistance with your transaction. If suspicious at any time, cancel your transaction and use another ATM.

* Pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others
* Use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business
* Avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* Cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* Check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

### Reserves and hiking trails

There have been attacks on hikers and tourists at reserves, hiking trails, including Table Mountain, Lions’ Head, Signal Hill and other tourist attractions and their parking lots.

Avoid the Numbi Gate entrance to the Kruger National Park, as well as the R538 road leading to it due to an increase in criminal activity in the area, including the murder of a foreign national in October 2022.

* Hike in groups and take all appropriate precautions
* Avoid isolated picnic areas and beaches
* Don’t stop at deserted roadside resting places on national roads

### Spiked food and drink

There have been incidents of food or drink being drugged and tourists robbed when unconscious.

Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism. Terrorist attacks could occur at any time. Individuals who may be inspired by terrorist groups may carry out “lone actor” attacks targeting public places, including where foreigners gather.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

South African authorities have successfully disrupted planned attacks and made arrests related to terrorism offences. Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

### Regional unrest

Xenophobic attacks, primarily targeting refugees or immigrants from other African nations, related demonstrations, looting and outbreaks of violence occur. This type of unrest could occur in any region of the country and with little warning.

Avoid large gatherings and demonstrations, monitor local media and follow the instructions of local authorities at all times.

### Townships and rural areas

Avoid townships and informal settlements if you are unfamiliar with them, except when travelling with organized tours provided by a reputable company or in association with an experienced local organization.

### Wildlife viewing

Wildlife viewing poses risks, particularly on foot or at close range. Be aware of the threat of monkeys and baboons overwhelming sightseers in their search for food. They are known to get very aggressive.

* Always maintain a safe distance when observing wildlife
* Only exit a vehicle when a professional guide or warden says it’s safe to do so
* Only use reputable and professional guides or tour operators
* Closely follow park regulations and wardens’ advice

### Water activities

Coastal waters have unpredictable wave and currents patterns, which can be dangerous. Shark attacks have been reported in several areas, including in KwaZulu-Natal and Western Cape.

* Follow the advice and warnings of local authorities
* Be cautious when swimming in lakes and rivers because of the risk posed by wildlife

### Telecommunications

Cellular phone reception is generally good in major towns and cities but can be intermittent in rural areas. Extended periods of rolling blackouts are impacting internet connectivity and cell phone networks.

Always carry a cellular phone in the event of an emergency. If using your own phone, ensure that it has international/roaming capability for use while in South Africa.

### Road safety

Fatal road accidents are common in South Africa.  Accidents occur especially in wet conditions, as roads can be very slippery. Traffic lights are frequently out of order. GPS navigation systems may suggest the most direct route but not the safest.

* Observe the recommended following distances
* Avoid undertaking overland travel after dark
* Treat all intersections with malfunctioning traffic lights as a four-way stop
* Verify your travel itinerary with a trusted local source, such as your hotel, your travel agent or local police, before driving

#### Road conditions

Road conditions are generally good, but some roads in the more remote areas are less well maintained.

Driving can be dangerous due to:

* potholes
* insufficient lighting
* pedestrians crossing major highways
* wild animals and stray livestock on the road

#### Driving habits

Drivers do not always respect traffic laws, especially at night. Drivers often drive at excess speed and ignore traffic signs. Drinking and driving is common.

Drivers are often aggressive toward pedestrians and fail to yield the right of way even on marked crosswalks.

Travel on foot is inadvisable in most areas. If walking is unavoidable, use only brightly lit, busy streets in popular tourist areas and maintain awareness of your surroundings.

If you choose to drive in South Africa:

* always drive defensively
* plan your trip in advance, especially if you are visiting a rural area
* avoid travelling after dark
* choose a vehicle with a robust central locking system, lockable fuel tank cap and vehicle alarm
* use a reliable rental company offering 24-hour emergency service and ensure that you have the contact details for the service

### Public transportation

Avoid using public transportation.

#### Bus

Tourists have been mugged and assaulted in and around bus stations. Avoid the central bus station in Johannesburg.

#### Train

Train services are slow and several serious accidents in recent years have raised concerns over safety standards.

Violent attacks have occurred on commuter and metro trains between Johannesburg and Pretoria, as well as on commuter trains in Cape Town. Don’t travel by train, especially second or third class.

The Gautrain between O.R. Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg and Pretoria, as well as the Blue Train and Rovos Rail, are, however, safe for tourists.

#### Taxis

Taxis cannot be hailed in the street. Ask your hotel to arrange a taxi and ensure that you prearrange transport for your return journey.

Sit in the rear of the vehicle and keep windows up and doors locked at all times. Keep valuables out of sight and place bags by your feet. Negotiate the fare with the driver in advance. Avoid using minibuses and unlicensed taxis.
