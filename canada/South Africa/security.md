#### Crime in and around airports

Passengers have been followed upon arrival at airports and then robbed either on their way to or once they arrived at their final destination. There are also reports of theft from checked luggage.

When travelling to and from an airport:

* plan to leave or arrive during daylight to reach your destination before nightfall
* stay on highways and main roads; avoid shortcuts
* if you are using a GPS, ensure the route avoids townships and secondary roads

Some areas surrounding Cape Town International Airport are dangerous with an increased risk of attack on secondary roads near the airport.

When travelling to and from Cape Town International Airport:

* use the M3 and N2 highways rather than the R300
* stay on exit 16 on the N2 highway (Airport Approach Road) instead of taking Borcherds Quarry Road, which leads to the Nyanga township

#### Crime on the road

Carjackings and armed robberies are common, especially after dark. Criminals often smash car windows at the following vulnerable points to steal valuables:

* traffic lights
* stop signs
* yield signs

* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

[Mass gatherings (large-scale events)](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/mass-gatherings)

### Spiked food and drink

There have been incidents of food or drink being drugged and tourists robbed when unconscious.

Never leave your food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Avoid accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as these items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism. Terrorist attacks could occur at any time. Individuals who may be inspired by terrorist groups may carry out “lone actor” attacks targeting public places, including where foreigners gather.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including police stations
* schools, including universities
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners
* cultural venues

South African authorities have successfully disrupted planned attacks and made arrests related to terrorism offences. Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

### Regional unrest

Xenophobic attacks, primarily targeting refugees and immigrants from other African nations, can be accompanied by demonstrations, looting and outbreaks of violence. Such unrest could occur in any region of the country and with little warning.

### Townships and rural areas

Avoid townships and informal settlements if you are unfamiliar with them, except when travelling with organized tours provided by a reputable company or in association with an experienced local organization.

### Wildlife observation

Wild animals can be dangerous, particularly if you are on foot or at close range. Monkeys, especially baboons, may aggressively confront sightseers in search of food, sometimes overwhelming them.

* Always maintain a safe distance when observing wildlife
* Only exit a vehicle when a professional guide or warden says it’s safe to do so
* Only use reputable and professional guides or tour operators
* Closely follow park regulations and wardens’ advice

### National parks and nature reserves

Many national parks and nature reserves are in remote areas with limited emergency services. Wild animals often venture within boundaries of camps.

If you decide to visit parks and reserves:

* Follow the advice and warnings of local tour guides and camp employees
* Do not walk around at night
* Never leave children unattended

### Reserves and hiking trails

There have been attacks on hikers and tourists at reserves and hiking trails, including Table Mountain, Lions’ Head, Signal Hill, and other tourist attractions and their parking lots.

* Hike in groups and take all appropriate precautions
* Avoid isolated picnic areas and beaches
* Don’t stop at deserted roadside resting places on national roads

Attacks also occurred on certain routes leading Kruger National Park and Addo Elephant Park.

* Avoid the Numbi Gate entrance to the Kruger National Park
* When travelling from Gqeberha (formerly Port Elizabeth) to Addo Elephant National Park, use the N2 via Colchester instead of the R335 via Motherwell

### Water activities

Coastal waters can be dangerous, even for experienced swimmers. Not all beaches are supervised. Shark attacks are common on South African shores. Around Cape Town, there is a flag system alerting on the presence of shark activity. Follow the advice and warnings of local authorities.

If you plan to participate in boating activities, such as snorkelling or diving:

* use a reputable company
* ensure that life jackets are available for all passengers
* do not use the equipment if you are unsure of its safety
* consult residents and tour operators for information on possible hazards, the presence of dangerous species and safe swimming areas
* don’t board boats that appear unseaworthy

### Outages

Nationwide power shortages or rolling blackouts, referred to as load shedding, can occur at any time. An official schedule of the planned blackouts provides advance notice of the shortages. However, they can also occur with very little notice.

Blackouts can be prolonged as criminals may steal components of the electrical infrastructure.

Blackouts can affect the following services and businesses:

* telecommunications and security systems
* food supply
* businesses
* hotels and other accommodations
* banks and ATMs
* gas stations
* public lighting and traffic lights

Interruptions to water supply occur occasionally and can be lengthy in some areas.

If you’re in South Africa:

* be prepared for extended power outages
* make sure you always have a complete emergency kit on hand, including several flashlights
* always carry a cell phone, power banks, chargers and a list of emergency numbers handy

### Telecommunications

Cellular phone reception is generally good in major towns and cities but can be intermittent in rural areas. Extended periods of rolling blackouts are impacting internet connectivity and cell phone networks.

Always carry a cellular phone in the event of an emergency. If using your own phone, ensure that it has international/roaming capability for use while in South Africa.

### Roads

#### Road safety

Fatal road accidents are common in South Africa and often involve pedestrians. Accidents occur especially in wet conditions, as roads can be very slippery. GPS navigation systems may suggest the most direct route but not the safest.

#### Road conditions

Roads are generally in good condition in and around major cities. They can be poorly maintained and dangerous in remote areas due to:

* potholes
* malfunctioning or insufficient lighting
* pedestrians crossing major highways
* stray animals on the road
* slippery roads during heavy rains

#### Driving habits

Drivers do not always respect traffic laws, especially at night. Drivers often drive at excess speed and ignore traffic signs. Drinking and driving is common.

Drivers are often aggressive toward pedestrians and fail to yield the right of way even on marked crosswalks.

Travel on foot is inadvisable in most areas. If walking is unavoidable, use only brightly lit, busy streets in popular tourist areas and maintain awareness of your surroundings.

If you choose to drive in South Africa:

* be aware that traffic drives on the left
* always drive defensively
* treat all intersections with malfunctioning traffic lights as a four-way stop
* plan your trip in advance, especially if you are visiting a rural area
* avoid travelling after dark
* use a reliable rental company offering 24-hour emergency service and ensure that you have the contact details for the service

### Public transportation

#### Bus

Avoid using public minibuses. Tourists have been mugged and assaulted both onboard and in bus stations.

#### Train

The following train services are safe and reliable:

* Gautrain
* Blue train
* Rovos Rail
* Shosholoza Meyl

All other rail services should be avoided due to attacks, theft, poor maintenance and accidents. Johannesburg’s train station and its surrounding area are dangerous due to high crime rates.

#### Taxis and ridesharing applications

Taxis availability may be limited outside major cities.

* Avoid hailing taxis on the street
* Use only licensed taxis selected by a reputable hotel or restaurant
* Sit in the rear of the vehicle and keep windows closed and doors locked at all times
* Keep valuables out of sight and place bags by your feet
* Never share a taxi with strangers
* Make sure the driver does not pick up other passengers on the way to your destination
* Ask the driver to start the meter or negotiate the fare in advance and have small bills available for payment

Due to ongoing violence between taxi associations and ridesharing drivers, passengers using ridesharing services have been mugged and assaulted in and around taxi stands.

* Avoid rideshare pickups or drop-offs near taxi stands
* Use a trusted ridesharing app
* Confirm the driver’s identity and licence plate before getting in the car
* Do not share your ride with another person
* Use a security feature to share your ride status with a contact
