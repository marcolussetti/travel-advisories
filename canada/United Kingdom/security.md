## Safety and security

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in Europe. Terrorists have carried out attacks in several European cities.

In the United Kingdom, previous attacks have resulted in casualties. They have included random violent incidents in public areas, such as knife and vehicle attacks as well as explosions.

These incidents have occurred mainly in the London area but have also happened elsewhere.

Further attacks in the United Kingdom are likely. Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places. Be particularly vigilant if attending:

* sporting events
* religious holidays
* public celebrations
* major political events, such as elections

Terrorists have used such occasions to mount attacks.

The Government of the United Kingdom maintains a public alert system on terrorism and communicates terrorism and national emergency threat level changes online and through local media. The national terrorism and national emergency threat level is currently 3 (“substantial”) on a scale of 5. A separate threat level for Northern Ireland is currently 4 (“severe”) on a scale of 5.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations take place regularly. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. Past violent clashes between protestors and security forces have resulted in assaults, riots, looting and vandalism. Protests can deteriorate quickly. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations, protests and large gatherings are taking place
* Exercise caution
* Expect an increased security force presence in areas where demonstrations are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, is common. Cellphone theft is common in certain tourist areas of London. Vehicle theft and theft from parked vehicles also occurs, particularly in tourist areas and roadside rest areas. Theft is common in restaurants, pubs and bars. Never leave bags or purses hanging on the back of your chair.

Thieves work alone and in groups. They may use various techniques to distract you and steal your belongings.

They are especially active in crowded areas, such as:

* tourist attractions and busy areas, including Piccadilly Circus, Trafalgar Square and Leicester Square
* airports and public transportation
* patios and outdoor cafés
* hotel lobbies
* underground pedestrian walkways
* roadside stops

#### Violent crime

Violent crime, such as mugging, knife crime and sexual assault occurs, particularly in larger cities. There have been incidents of passengers being sexually assaulted and robbed when riding in unlicensed taxis.

If you are the victim of a crime on the transportation system, including in a taxi, consult Transport for London to learn how to report it.

#### Strikes

Strikes and pressure tactics occur from time to time, in key sectors such as transport. These strikes can sometimes complicate travel and disrupt public services.

* Consult local media to be aware of strikes that may affect your stay or travel plans
* In the event of a transport strike, plan extra time to get to your destination

#### Northern Ireland

### Adventure tourism

Outdoor activities, such as hiking and biking, may lead to safety concerns if they are not well-organized. Weather conditions can change rapidly, even in summer.

Avalanches can occur in Scotland, especially in the Cairngorms area between December and April. Check local avalanche forecasts before you go.

If you intend to go walking, biking or hiking in remote areas:

* never do so alone and do not part with your hiking companions
* obtain detailed information on your activity and on the environment in which you will be doing it before setting out
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* avoid venturing off marked trails
* ensure that you’re adequately equipped
* stay informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary

### Road safety

Vehicles drive on the left.

Pedestrians should use caution when crossing streets and be mindful that traffic comes from the opposite direction than it does in Canada. There are many one-way streets in London and other cities. Always confirm the direction of traffic before you cross the street.

#### Road conditions

Roads are excellent but are often narrow and congested, especially in urban areas. Use caution when entering a traffic circle (roundabout). Rural roads may become hazardous during severe weather conditions. You should be especially careful when driving in the countryside during periods bad weather or freezing temperature. You should always slow down before approaching turns on narrow roads as curves may hide oncoming traffic.

### Public transportation

Public transportation is extensive. Train and bus services connect most cities and areas of the country.

#### Taxis

Taxis are widely available. Only use officially licensed and marked taxis or private hire vehicles.
