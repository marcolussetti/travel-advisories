# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### General elections

General elections are scheduled for November 30, 2025. There may be demonstrations before, during and after the elections.

If you are in Honduras:

* expect an increased security presence
* avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* follow the instructions of local authorities
* monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

[More information on demonstrations and civil unrest](#demonstrations)

### Borders areas

Border areas often see higher criminal activity and violence.

If you’re travelling by land to neighbouring countries:

* use official border crossings only
* consider crossing borders in the morning as they sometimes close unexpectedly early
* avoid anyone suggesting that they can obtain your documents quicker or cheaper on your behalf
* keep the receipt of payment of the border fee until you leave the country

#### Guatemala

Criminal groups are especially active on the coast between the Guatemalan border and Puerto Cortés. Criminal activities include:

* theft
* drug trafficking
* human trafficking
* kidnapping

There has also been an increased number of migrants leaving Honduras through Guatemala, particularly at the border crossing in Agua Caliente. This movement results in periodic closures.

The El Florido border crossing in the town of Copán is also closed daily from 9 pm to 6 am.

#### Nicaragua

There has also been an increased number of migrants leaving Nicaragua through Honduras, particularly at the border crossings in Las Manos and Trojes.

Expect possible delays at borders.

#### Department of Cortés

Street gangs and criminal groups are very active in the Cortés municipalities of:

* San Pedro Sula
* Choloma
* La Lima

The number of murder and violent crime is higher in these areas.

#### Departments of Colón, Gracias a Dios, Olancho and Yoro

Drugs smuggling and violence pose security threats in the northern departments of:

* Colón
* Gracias a Dios
* Olancho
* Yoro

Roadblocks and violent incidents related to land disputes in Colón, mostly in the Aguán valley and in the north coast area near Trujillo, have occurred.

The department of Gracias a Dios is a remote area where law enforcement and access to government services are very limited. Levels of criminal activity are high.

#### La Ceiba

Violent crime is high in the coastal city of La Ceiba. This includes murders and armed robberies.

Although tourists are not the primary target of criminals, you could be in the wrong place at the wrong time.

If you consider travelling to La Ceiba:

* use reputable tour operators only
* choose accommodation with good security measures
* avoid outings outside the resort

#### Bay Islands

The Bay Islands are generally safe.  Violent crime is lower, but petty crime sometimes occurs.

Some foreigners have been assaulted on beaches, mainly at night. Home burglaries have also occurred, sometimes in rental accommodations.

While in the Bay Islands:

* avoid Coxen hole, Los Fuertes and Suampo neighbourhoods after dark
* avoid isolated beaches and areas
* stay in well-lit areas
* choose accommodation with good security measures
* make sure you lock windows and doors at night and when you are away

If you’re docking in Roatán and getting off the cruise ship, you should consider booking a tour or a sightseeing trip through a reputable company to avoid becoming the victim of a scam.

### Crime

#### Violent crime

Although the overall situation has slightly improved since 2022, violent crime remains a concern throughout Honduras. The country retains one of the highest homicide rates in the world.

Drug trafficking, transnational organized crime and street gang activity is prevalent in certain neighbourhoods. Violent incidents are frequent, including:

* murders
* armed robberies
* kidnappings
* extortions
* home invasions
* sexual assaults

These crimes are carried out by criminals acting individually or as a group.

Many Hondurans are armed. Guns and other weapons, such as machetes and knives, are frequently used. Incidents of armed robbery occur mainly on urban streets during the day and on intercity buses at night.

The Government of Honduras lacks sufficient resources to properly respond to, investigate and prosecute cases. Infiltration within the security forces by local gangs weaken law enforcement even further. Criminals linked to organized crime often operate with a high degree of impunity throughout Honduras.

* Remain aware of your surroundings at all times
* Maintain your cellphone charged
* Avoid travelling after dark
* Avoid walking alone
* Keep a low profile
* Avoid carrying large amounts of cash
* don’t resist if you’re threatened, hand over your cash and valuables immediately

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and bag snatching, occurs. Thefts commonly occur in:

* popular tourist areas
* bus terminals and airports
* shopping malls and hotel lobbies
* restaurants, including patios

To avoid becoming a victim:

* be suspicious of recent acquaintances or strangers approaching you
* avoid accepting rides or invitations from strangers
* avoid hitchhiking
* ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secured at all times
* avoid carrying large amounts of cash
* avoid showing signs of affluence

### State of emergency

Local authorities periodically declare a state of emergency in various municipalities to fight against gang-related crime and extortion.

While a state of emergency is in effect, security forces have increased rights to restrict freedom of movement, conduct searches, make seizures and detain persons of interest.

If you are travelling in an area where a state of emergency is in effect:

* be aware that you may be subject to searches by security forces
* always cooperate with military and police officers
* carry valid ID at all times and be prepared for various checkpoints
* allow extra time to reach your destination
* follow the instructions of local authorities
* monitor local news to stay informed on the current situation

### Express kidnappings

Express kidnappings can occur in urban areas.

These kidnappings are often committed by organised gangs or taxi drivers. The kidnappers usually take their victims to an ATM and force them to make a cash withdrawal.

* Avoid hailing taxis on the street
* If you’re threatened, don’t resist

### Demonstrations and civil unrest

Demonstrations take place regularly. In Tegucigalpa, demonstrations may occur:

* at the National Congress and Central Park
* at the National Autonomous University of Honduras
* at the United States Embassy
* at the Centro Civico
* at the Presidential Palace
* at the Hospital Escuela
* on Suyapa and Centroamerica boulevards
* on La Paz and Los Próceres avenues
* along the Peripheral Ring Road

In San Pedro Sula, protesters usually gather at the Monumento a la Madre.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

Honduran law prohibits political activities by foreigners. Participating in demonstrations or activities may result in you being detained or deported.

### Water activities

Coastal waters can be dangerous. Riptides are common.

Rescue services may not be consistent with international standards. Not all beaches have lifeguards or warning flags to warn of unsafe conditions.

* Only undertake scuba diving and other water activities with a well-established company
* Don’t swim alone alone or outside marked areas
* Consult residents and tour operators for information on possible hazards and safe swimming areas
* Monitor weather warnings

### Adventure tourism

Outdoor activities, such as hiking, diving, mountain biking and other adventure activities can be dangerous if unprepared. Trails are not always marked, and weather conditions can change rapidly, even in during summer.

If you intend to practice adventure tourism:

* never do so alone, and do not part with your expedition companions
* obtain detailed information on your activity and on the environment in which you will be before setting out
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* avoid venturing off marked trails
* ensure that you’re adequately equipped and bring sufficient water
* stay informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* refrain from using facilities or equipment if you have doubts on their safety
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary

### Road travel

Road conditions and road safety are poor throughout the country. Accidents causing fatalities are common. The number of traffic accidents involving tourists has also increased.

#### Road conditions

Many roads are poorly delineated due to regular flooding. Driving can be dangerous due to:

* roaming livestock and wildlife
* poorly maintained roads and bridges
* unpaved roads
* inadequate lighting
* lack of signage
* lack of guardrails
* winding mountain roads
* overloaded or poorly maintained vehicles
* slow-moving or heavy traffic, especially in San Pedro Sula and Tegucigalpa

If you’re travelling by land, use caution between:

* El Progreso and La Ceiba
* Chamelecón and Copán via Cofradía
* Copán and Gracias Lempira
* Limones to La Unión

Between Tegucigalpa to Trujillo, you should use the RN39 and transit via Gualaco, San Esteban and Bonito Oriental rather than the RN41 via Salamá et Sabá.

#### Road safety

Drivers don’t respect traffic laws. They often drive at excessive speeds. They may be aggressive and reckless.

If you drive in Honduras:

* always drive defensively
* maintain a heightened awareness along all routes
* plan your trip ahead of time, especially if you plan to visit a rural area
* avoid road travel at night
* keep your car doors locked and the windows closed at all times
* avoid picking up hitchhikers
* carry a cell phone and a charger
* avoid renting cars and motorcycles from operators who don’t provide insurance
* ensure that helmets meet international safety standards

#### Police officer impersonation

Gang members and criminals sometimes disguise themselves as police officers. At legitimate police checkpoints, you should see:

* a police vehicle
* green cones
* at least five police officers

If you have any doubts, you may contact the Honduran Transit Authority by dialing 911 to confirm the location of the roadblocks and the identity of the individuals stopping you before rolling down your window or opening your door.

Sometimes, thieves also pose as victims of road accidents.

* Don’t stop to help a person at the side of the road
* Report any suspicious incidents at the next police checkpoint

### Public transportation

Public transportation in Honduras is unsafe and unreliable.

#### Buses

Most urban public buses are poorly maintained. Drivers are reckless. Accidents are common.

Incidents of armed robbery are frequent on public buses. Incidents of arson have also occurred.

* Avoid intercity public transportation
* Use only companies that offer non-stop service from your place of departure to your destination

#### Taxis

Some taxis are an acceptable option for transportation.

When travelling to the airport, you may pre-arrange your pickup with your hotel prior to your departure. Authorized airport taxis drivers wear easily identifiable ID badges.

* Use a reliable taxi company recommended by your hotel
* Don’t use white street taxis
* Never board taxis at taxi stands or flag taxis in the street
* Never use shared taxis
* Make sure the driver doesn’t pick up other passengers along the way to your destination
* Note driver’s name and plate number
* Negotiate the fare in advance
* Make sure you have small bills as taxi drivers often don’t make change
