## Natural disasters and climate

### Hurricane season

The hurricane season is from mid-May to the end of November in the Pacific, and from early June to the end of November in the Atlantic, Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. During this period, even small tropical storms can quickly develop into major hurricanes.

These severe storms can put you at risk and hamper the provision of essential services. You could face serious safety risks during a hurricane. You should carefully consider these risks when planning a trip during the hurricane season.

If you decide to travel to a coastal area during the hurricane season despite the risks:

* be prepared to change your travel plans on short notice, including cutting short or cancelling your trip
* stay informed of the latest regional weather forecasts
* carry emergency contact information for your airline or tour operator
* follow the advice and instructions of local authorities

### Rainy season

The rainy season extends from May to November. It can lead to severe flooding.

Seasonal flooding can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable due to mudslides and landslides. Bridges, buildings, and infrastructure may be damaged.

* Monitor local media for the latest updates, including those on road conditions
* Stay away from flooded areas
* Monitor weather reports
* Follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders

### Wildfires

Wildfires are common between December and April.

The air quality in areas near active fires may deteriorate due to heavy smoke.

In case of a major fire:

* stay away from the affected area, particularly if you suffer from respiratory ailments
* follow the instructions of local emergency services personnel
* monitor local media for up-to-date information on the situation

### Earthquakes and tsunamis

Honduras is located in an active seismic zone. Earthquakes and tsunamis can occur.

Even minor earthquakes can cause significant damage.

Tsunami warnings may be issued after a strong earthquake. A tsunami can occur within minutes of a nearby earthquake. However, the risk of tsunami can remain for several hours following the first tremor. If you’re staying on the coast, familiarize yourself with the region’s evacuation plans in the event of a tsunami warning.
