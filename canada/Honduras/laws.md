## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Transfer to a Canadian prison

Canada and Honduras are signatories to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in Honduras to request a transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both Canadian and Honduran authorities.

This process can take a long time, and there is no guarantee that the transfer will be approved by either or both sides.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect lengthy jail sentences or heavy fines.

Honduras is used as a drug trafficking hub between South and North America.

* Pack your own luggage and monitor it closely at all times
* Don’t transport other people’s packages, bags or suitcases
* Never exchange money for strangers, as this is a common request from money launderers

### Exports

Honduran law prohibits the export of:

* firearms
* antiques and artifacts from pre-colonial civilizations
* some birds, feathers, flora and fauna

### Investments

Disputes related to property acquisition or other investments are costly and take time to resolve.

Many tourists have reported complications during real estate transactions in Honduras.

If you plan on buying property, or making other investments in Honduras:

* seek legal advice in Canada and in Honduras before making commitments
* choose your own Honduran lawyer specializing in real estate
* avoid hiring a lawyer recommended by a seller
* visit the property in person before purchasing
* carefully review the sales contract as it may contain irregularities
* confirm the name of the last owner and verify that the property is free of any mortgage or taxes from the local property registry (Instituto de la propiedad)
* confirm that there are no heritage or land ownership disputes

### Political activities

It’s illegal for foreigners to participate in local political activities, rallies or public demonstrations in Honduras.

Political involvement may result in your deportation or expulsion.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Honduras.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Honduras, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Honduran law does not prohibit sexual acts between individuals of the same sex. However, same-sex couples are not legally recognized.

LGBTQ2 persons could be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or sex characteristics.

Avoid public displays of affection.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Honduras.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Honduras, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Honduran court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Honduras to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Driving

You may drive in Honduras with your valid Canadian driver license for up to 3 months.

At all times when driving, you must carry:

* your driver’s license
* your passport
* the vehicle’s registration

In the event of a car accident:

* remain at the scene
* don’t move your vehicle until the authorities arrive

* call 911 to report the accident and request Transit Police

Failure to remain at the site may be considered an admission of guilt under Honduran law. However, some accidents may attract a crowd that could turn hostile. If you feel unsafe:

* ensure your windows and doors are locked
* drive to the nearest police station or a secure location
* report the accident to the police and your insurance company as soon as possible

If you are involved in a road accident causing injuries, you may be temporarily detained, regardless of culpability.

You cannot exchange Canadian dollars in Honduras. You can easily exchange U.S. dollars.

ATMs are available in urban areas but not all foreign cards work at all ATMs or points of service. They may be rare in rural areas.

A valid passport is required for all financial transactions.
