# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Honduran authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid at least 6 months from the date of entry.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Entry stamp

Immigration authorities will stamp your passport upon arrival and write down the number of days you are allowed in the country. The 90-day period is not guaranteed, and the decision is at their discretion.

You may face a fine and possible delays if you fail to present an entry-stamped passport when departing Honduras.

* Make sure your passport has been stamped upon arrival
* Take good note of the maximum length of your approved stay

### Central America-4 Border Control Agreement

Under the terms of the Central America-4 Border Control Agreement (CA-4), Canadian tourists may travel freely within any of the following CA-4 countries:

* El Salvador
* Guatemala
* Honduras
* Nicaragua

You can travel between these countries for up to 90 days without having to undergo entry and exit formalities at border immigration checkpoints.

You must still check in at immigration counters when you enter or exit these checkpoints.

The 90-day period begins at the first point of entry to any of the CA-4 countries. You will be fined if you exceed the 90-day limit.

### Entering by land

If you plan to enter by land, you need to pay 3 USD or the equivalent in lempiras.

### Stay extension

You can apply for extensions of up to 30 days at a time, at the discretion of the immigration authorities. You must request this extension and pay the required fee at the Honduran immigration office before your first 90-day limit expires.

### Other entry requirements

Customs officials may ask you to show them:

* a return or onward ticket
* proof that you have sufficient funds for the duration of your stay

### Children and travel

The age of majority in Honduras is 21. The country has strict requirements for the entry and exit of minors.

A minor must show a written and notarized authorization to travel:

* signed by both parents if travelling alone
* signed by the non-travelling parent if travelling with one parent only

The written authorization must be in Spanish and authenticated by the Honduran authorities prior to arrival.

This is also enforced if the minor has a residential or citizenship tie to Honduras inherited from one of the parents, even if the tie has not been legally registered.
