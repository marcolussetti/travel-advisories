# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

The authorities of a country or territory decide who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Honduran authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid at least 6 months from the date of entry.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with a “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

You should also be aware that current systems used by some countries and travel companies may not recognize the “X” gender identifier. You may still be asked to provide your sex/gender information as either male or female when travelling.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Entry stamp

Immigration authorities will stamp your passport upon arrival and write down the number of days you are allowed in the country. The 90-day period is not guaranteed, and the decision is at their discretion.

* Make sure your passport is stamped upon arrival
* Take good note of your total authorized stay

### Central America-4 Border Control Agreement (CA-4)

Under the terms of the Central America-4 Border Control Agreement (CA-4), Canadian tourists may travel freely within any of the following CA-4 countries:

* El Salvador
* Guatemala
* Honduras
* Nicaragua

You can travel between these countries for up to 90 days without having to undergo entry and exit formalities at border immigration checkpoints. However, 90 days are not automatically granted. The immigration officer at your first entry point into the CA-4 region will determine the exact length of your authorized stay.

You must still check in at immigration counters when you enter or exit these checkpoints.

Make sure you receive an entry or exit stamp in your passport each time you cross a checkpoint to avoid fines and problems with immigration authorities.

You may request an extension of up to 30 days. However, you must request this extension and pay the required fee at the National Migration Institute before your first authorized stay expires. Immigration authorities will determine the exact length of the extension.

You are authorized to stay in Honduras for a maximum of 120 days. Therefore, if you receive an extension in another CA-4 country that leads to a total authorized stay of less than 120 days, you may request another extension of up to 30 days in Honduras, as long as it does not exceed 120 days. Likewise, if you receive an extension in another CA-4 country that leads to a total authorized stay of more than 120 days, Honduras will only recognize the first 120 days.

Once your total authorized stay expires, you must either:

* change your migratory status
* leave the CA-4 region
* travel to El Salvador, where you may be granted a stay of up to 180 days

If you fail to do so, you will be fined and given 5 days to leave.

Once you leave the CA-4 region, you may attempt to return and restart the process without delay. However, the immigration officer could deny your re-entry.

If you get a new Canadian passport in Honduras, you do not need to obtain a new entry stamp from immigration authorities to exit the country, since your information is saved digitally upon arrival. However, you could encounter issues when travelling within the CA-4 region if you do not have proof of your entry stamp. To avoid problems, you should obtain a new entry stamp from immigration authorities before exiting the country and travelling within the CA-4 region.

Each CA-4 country interprets and enforces the agreement differently. Ensure you carefully read the Travel Advice and Advisories for each destination you plan on visiting before travelling.

### Entering by land

### Other entry requirements

Customs officials may ask you to show them:

* a return or onward ticket
* proof that you have sufficient funds for the duration of your stay

### Children and travel

The age of majority in Honduras is 21. The country has strict requirements for the entry and exit of minors.

A minor must show a written and notarized authorization to travel:

* signed by both parents if travelling alone
* signed by the non-travelling parent if travelling with one parent only

The written authorization must be in Spanish and authenticated by the Honduran authorities prior to arrival.

This is also enforced if the minor has a residential or citizenship tie to Honduras inherited from one of the parents, even if the tie has not been legally registered.
