# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Cypriot authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Entry to Cyprus

It is illegal to enter the island of Cyprus through the so-called “Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus”.

Authorities may not let you go through checkpoints at the United Nations Buffer Zone if you have previously entered through Ercan International Airport or the Port of Famagusta.

### Crossing the UN buffer zone or “green line”

If you need to cross the UN buffer zone or “green line”, make sure you do so at one of the designated crossing points. It is illegal to do so elsewhere.

### British sovereign base areas

There are two sovereign British military bases on the island of Cyprus, one in Akrotiri and the other in Dhekelia. These bases are under British jurisdiction. Entry of civilians is restricted in certain areas.

Be aware of entry restrictions if travelling in the vicinity of the base areas.

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you use for travel.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond the date you expect to leave from Cyprus.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.
