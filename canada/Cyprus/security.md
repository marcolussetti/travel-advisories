## Safety and security

### Political situation

Since 1974, Cyprus has been divided de facto into a northern and a southern part.

The Government of the Republic of Cyprus, the only internationally recognized authority, controls the Greek Cypriot southern part of the island.

An autonomous Turkish Cypriot administration controls the northern area. Canada does not recognize the so-called “Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus” or its administration. It is illegal to enter the island of Cyprus through the so-called “Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus”. If you conduct certain activities in the northern part, you may subject to scrutiny and face legal issues in the Greek Cypriot southern part of the island.

Our ability to provide consular assistance in this area may be limited.

If you travel to the northern part:

* exercise a high degree of caution
* only enter through legal and designated crossing points
* be aware of laws and restrictions that may lead to legal issues

#### UN Buffer zone or “green line”

The northern and the southern parts are divided by a buffer zone or “green line”, which is controlled by the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP). There is a military presence on both sides of the buffer zone and certain areas are mined.

You must request an authorization from the UNFICYP to enter the buffer zone, except for the areas designated as “civil use areas”. Crossing in both directions is only allowed at designated crossing points.

Incidents in the vicinity of the buffer zone do occur. While the situation is generally calm, confrontations can’t be ruled out.

### Crime

Petty crime such as pickpocketing and purse snatching occurs, particularly in urban areas.

Ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times.

### Fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud occurs.

When using debit or credit cards:

* pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others
* use ATMs located in public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

### Spiked food and drinks

Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in Europe. Terrorists have carried out attacks in several European cities. Terrorist attacks could occur at any time.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations and strikes take place regularly. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Water activities

#### Swimming

Coastal waters can be dangerous. Always obey warning flags at beaches.

The main warning flags used in Cyprus are:

* Green: calm waters, swimming is allowed
* Yellow: agitated waters, swim with precautions
* Red: dangerous waters or presence of dangerous aquatic species, swimming is prohibited

In marine areas, coral, jellyfish and other aquatic life found along reefs can poison, sting or cause infection if touched or stepped on.

* Ask local authorities about the presence of dangerous species and immediately seek medical assistance if you get hurt
* Avoid visiting beaches or coastal areas during periods of severe weather warnings
* Look out for signs warning of cliff erosion and falling rocks
* Don’t dive into unknown waters, as hidden rocks or shallow depths can cause serious injury or death
* Exercise caution and follow the advice of the local authorities

#### Recreational boating

If you are planning to go boating:

* know the capacity of your boat (people and weight) and don’t exceed it
* know the navigation rules
* follow safe practices for all activities on the water: personal watercraft, water-skiing and towed devices, diving or swimming, fishing, etc.
* equip your boat with a VHF marine radio that will generate your position in case of emergency
* be prepared for emergencies

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety can vary greatly throughout the country.

Modern highways link the major cities. Traffic is usually highly congested in Nicosia. Rural and mountain roads could be narrow, winding and poorly maintained.

Running red lights, speeding and tailgating are common causes of accidents.

Sidewalks are narrow or non-existent. As a result, pedestrians often walk on roadways, which poses a major safety hazard. Drivers and speeding motorbikes do not always yield to pedestrians.

### Public transportation

There are public buses connecting most areas of the island.

#### Taxis

Taxis are generally safe.

* Use only officially marked taxis
* Negotiate fares in advance, or insist that the driver use the meter, as you may be overcharged

We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.
