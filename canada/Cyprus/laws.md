## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Transfer to a Canadian prison

Canada and Cyprus are signatories to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in Cyprus to request a transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both Canadian and Cyprus authorities.

This process can take a long time, and there is no guarantee that the transfer will be approved by either or both sides.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect jail sentences or heavy fines.

### Photography

There are restrictions on photographing:

* military installations in both the north and south
* military personnel
* UN buffer zone

English-language signs are generally posted in sensitive areas advising of the restrictions.

* Refrain from photographing military installations or personnel even if no signs are posted
* Comply with all requests from local authorities

### Customs

The Republic of Cyprus enforces restrictions and prohibition on the importation of certain items proceeding from the so-called “Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus”.

Confirm these regulations before crossing the UN buffer zone or “green line”.

### Real Estate

If you plan on purchasing or renting a property in the so-called “Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus”, make sure you seek legal advice before committing to any transaction. Transactions may be illegal under the laws of the Republic of Cyprus since most of the properties belong to owners displaced in 1974 by Turkish military occupation.

If you illegally rent or purchase one of these properties, you may face civil lawsuits from the legitimate owners and legal issues in the Republic of Cyprus.

You should also avoid entering the Republic of Cyprus with advertisements or brochures promoting these properties. They could be used as evidence in a lawsuit.

### Accommodations in the northern part

If you stay in a hotel or any other type of commercial accommodations in the so-called “Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus”, you could face legal issues if the building or land lawfully belongs to owners displaced in 1974 by Turkish military occupation.

Seek accommodation in establishments lawfully owned by Turkish Cypriots.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Cyprus.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Cyprus, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

#### Compulsory military service

Canadians with dual citizenship or who are eligible for Cypriot citizenship may be subject to compulsory military service and other national obligations.

Confirm this requirement before travelling to Cyprus.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Cyprus.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Cyprus, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Cypriot court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Cyprus to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Driving

You must be at least 18 years old to drive a vehicle in Cyprus.

You can use your valid Canadian driver’s licence for up to 6 months. You should carry an international driving permit.

Traffic drives on the left.

Liability insurance is mandatory. Vehicle insurance purchased in the Republic of Cyprus is not valid in the so-called “Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus”. You must have a separate insurance policy when driving in the northern part, including when driving rental cars.

### Money

The currency of the Republic of Cyprus is the euro (EUR). The Turkish lira (TRY) is in circulation in the so-called “Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus”.

If you are carrying €10,000 or more, or the equivalent in other currencies, you must make a declaration to customs when you enter or leave the European Union. It includes sums in:

* banknotes and coins
* bearer negotiable instruments such as cheques, travellers’ cheques, promissory notes and money orders
* bonds, shares
* gold coins with a gold content of at least 90 %
* gold bars, nuggets or clumps with a gold content of at least 99.5 %
* any other convertible asset

This does not apply if you are travelling within the European Union or in transit to a non-EU country.
