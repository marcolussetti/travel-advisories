## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect heavy fines and lengthy jail sentences.

#### Alcohol

The consumption of alcohol in public is illegal. Public intoxication is also a criminal offence, no matter where the alcohol was consumed.

Avoid drinking alcohol outside licensed premises.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Yemeni law criminalizes sexual acts and relationships between persons of the same sex.

2SLGBTQI+ persons could also be discriminated against or detained based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or sex characteristics.

If you are convicted, you could face corporal punishment, imprisonment or the death penalty.

2SLGBTQI+ persons should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Yemen.

### Dress and behaviour

Yemeni customs, laws and regulations adhere closely to traditional and Islamic practices and beliefs. Women should carry a headscarf to cover their head at all times while travelling in Yemen.

To avoid offending local sensitivities:

* dress conservatively
* behave discreetly
* respect religious and social traditions
* seek permission prior to photographing individuals

### Religious proselytism

Religious proselytism is illegal.

Avoid engaging in religious activities that contradict or challenge Islamic teachings and values. This includes preaching, possessing, or distributing religious literature or material.

### Ramadan

In 2025, the lunar month of Ramadan is expected to begin on or around February 28.

In public, between sunrise and sunset, refrain from:

* drinking
* eating
* smoking

### Marriage

Common law partnership is illegal in Yemen. Men and women are not permitted to share a home unless they are legally married or are related to one another.

Sexual relations outside of marriage are a criminal offence and may be subject to severe punishment, including the death penalty.

### Family law

Yemen family law is different from Canadian family law. Yemen isn't a signatory to The Hague Convention. Decisions are based on Islamic law. It's extremely difficult for woman, even if she is a Muslim, to obtain custody of her children through Yemeni courts. Canadian custody orders may not be recognized in Yemen.

Local authorities may prevent Canadian children or spouse from leaving the country without prior authorization of the Yemeni father, husband or male relative.

To avoid any difficulties in Yemen, consult a Canadian and a Yemeni lawyer before travelling. If you're involved in legal proceedings such as divorce or custody dispute in Yemen, consult a Yemeni lawyer for advice and assistance regarding your own specific situation.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Yemen.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Yemen by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Yemen to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Identification

Local authorities may ask you to show identification at any time.

Depending on the region and the local authority, each town may have an entrance checkpoint where you will have to show your travel documents if you travel by land. You must also obtain permission from the Yemen Tourist Police to travel outside Sanaa.

* Carry identification documents at all times
* Keep a photocopy of your passport and visa in a safe place, in case they are lost or confiscated

### Driving

You must carry an International Driving Permit.
