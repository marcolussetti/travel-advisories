## Safety and security

### Tensions in the Middle East

The security situation remains unpredictable and could deteriorate significantly with little or no warning.

This may result in travel disruptions, including flight cancellations and airspace closures.

You should:

* monitor local and international media to stay informed of the rapidly evolving situation
* be vigilant and follow the instructions of local authorities at all times
* Register or update your contact information with the [Registration of Canadians Abroad](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/registration "https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/registration") service to receive the latest information from the Government of Canada

### Security situation

Despite truce agreements, the security situation in Yemen remains highly unstable and unpredictable due to the ongoing civil war that started in 2014. The state of emergency declared in March 2011 remains in effect.

Armed terrorist and criminal groups are still active in many parts of the country, particularly in the south.

The humanitarian situation remains extremely precarious in the country due to several years of armed clashes between rebels and a coalition led by neighboring countries that conducted airstrikes on territories held by rebels in western and northern Yemen. The conflict led to the displacement of millions of people and significant disruptions to the availability of essential services and goods such as:

* food
* water
* medical supplies
* power distribution
* health care
* sanitation

There is severe damage to critical infrastructure, including hospitals.

The Government of Canada has urged Canadians to leave Yemen since May 2009 and continues to advise against all travel to Yemen. Commercial means to leave the country are extremely limited. If the armed conflict intensifies it could impact your ability to depart the country by commercial means.

Your safety continues to be at risk in Yemen due to war, terrorism, and kidnapping. The Government of Canada’s ability to provide consular assistance and other support in Yemen is extremely limited.

Do not travel to Yemen. If you choose to travel to Yemen, or remain in the country, despite this advisory:

* seek safe shelter and remain there until you can identify safe means to exit
* maintain emergency provisions such as water and food
* exercise extreme caution at all times
* always be aware of your surroundings
* keep in mind that you are responsible for your own safety and that of your family
* ensure that your travel documents are up-to-date
* monitor local and international media to stay informed of the situation

### Regional conflicts

Since November 2023, rebels regularly conduct attacks against commercial vessels in the Red Sea with drones and missiles. In response, since January 2024, a US-led coalition has conducted air strikes on rebel-controlled positions in western and northern Yemen, including the cities of Hajjah, Taiz, Hodeidah and Sanaa.

The rebels have also conducted rockets, drones and missiles attacks on Israeli territory,  leading to retaliatory airstrikes in Yemen.

Israeli airstrikes have caused casualties and targeted infrastructure, including:

* the Sanaa International Airport
* ports
* power stations
* oil terminals

During the civil war between rebels and government forces, armed rebels in Yemen have targeted neighbouring countries, such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, in retaliation for their involvement in the war in Yemen. The April 2022 truce significantly reduced the violence in the country and in the region, but there is still no agreement to end the civil war. There is a continued risk of internal armed conflict and a heightened risk of attacks targeting western interests in Yemen and in the region.

Due to security risks, the Government of Canada cannot provide assistance to citizens trying to leave Yemen by land to Saudi Arabia.

### Terrorism

There is a high threat of terrorism.Terrorists have targeted Western interests and Yemeni government buildings. Terrorist groups also target checkpoints manned by the Houthi rebel group in Sanaa and elsewhere in the country, and target Houthis in general.

Terrorist attacks could occur at any time.

Other targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places. Exercise extreme caution, particularly in areas known to be frequented by foreigners.

Be particularly vigilant during:

* religious holidays
* public celebrations
* major political events, such as elections

Terrorists may use such occasions to mount attacks.

Exercise extreme caution, particularly in areas known to be frequented by foreigners.

### Kidnapping

There is a high risk of kidnapping, especially on the highway connecting the cities of Sanaa, Ta’izz and Aden. Foreigners have been targeted. Some hostages have been killed.

* Be extremely vigilant at all times
* Avoid travelling on the Sanaa– Ta’izz –Aden highway
* Use varied and unpredictable travel routes and schedules

### Demonstrations and civil unrest

Demonstrations take place frequently due to the ongoing conflict throughout the country.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Landmines

Landmines and unexploded munitions remain a danger in the southern and eastern areas of the country, particularly around Aden, and in the central highlands. Most have been marked and access clearly delimited.

* Exercise caution in these areas
* Look for posted landmine warnings
* Stay on paved roads
* Avoid walking or hiking in these areas

### Crime

#### Violent crime

Car bombs and drones have been used in assassinations.

Exercise a high level of personal security awareness at all times.

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs. Although credit cards are rarely accepted, scams may also occur.

Carjacking is a serious concern in Yemen.

* Don’t show signs of affluence
* Avoid travelling at night
* Lock car doors and ensure that windows are closed at all times
* Ensure that personal belongings and passports and other travel documents are secure at all times

### Women’s safety

Women travelling alone have been subject to different types of harassment, verbal abuse, or physical assaults.

If you are the victim of a sexual assault, you should report it immediately to the nearest Government of Canada office.

* Avoid travelling alone, especially at night
* Remain particularly vigilant in less populous areas
* Be careful when dealing with strangers or recent acquaintances

### Shortages

#### Fuel

There is a shortage of fuel in Yemen. You may have difficulty securing fuel. Fuel and diesel shortages could impact sectors and services such as:

* transport
* telecommunication, including internet
* water and waste collection
* shops, cafes and restaurants

#### Power

Power shortages often occur.

Not all businesses are equipped with a generator. As a result, shortages could affect essential services such as:

* health care services
* food production
* goods distribution

#### Food

Certain parts of Yemen are experiencing famine. If food is available, it can be expensive because most of the country’s food is imported.

Plan to have adequate water, food and fuel supplies.

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety are poor throughout the country.

Drivers may not respect traffic laws and may often drive on the wrong side of the road. Vehicles are poorly maintained. Roaming animals also pose hazards.

Roadblocks and checkpoints may be set up without warning. Local authorities may close access to certain areas without notice.

If you are involved in an accident resulting in death or injuries, you may be jailed or fined. Compensation has to be paid to the family of any victim.

If you chose to drive in Yemen:

* undertake overland travel in a convoy of four-wheel-drive vehicles and with an experienced guide only
* avoid driving after dark
* leave a travel itinerary with a third party
* be well prepared and equipped with gasoline, water, food and a cell phone
* avoid renting a car and driving it yourself
* call the police if involved in an accident

### Public transportation

Public transportation is unsafe and unreliable.

#### Buses

Minibuses service – known as dabaabs – is available in most major cities. However, many bus drivers aren’t experienced and don’t respect traffic laws.

If you want to reach Aden or Seiyun airport, the International Organization for Migration may be able to help by providing ground transportation through a local bus company. You may purchase tickets through their local offices.

Once you arrive at Aden or Seiyun airport, you will need to produce copies of airline tickets at checkpoints.

#### Taxis

Shared taxis are common in Yemen. Private taxis are also available in major cities and at airports.

Motorcycles are often used as taxis. Drivers may often drive on the wrong side of the road and don’t follow traffic laws. Accidents are common.

* Use officially marked taxis only
* Negotiate fares in advance or insist that the driver use the meter
* Avoid taking shared taxis
* Never enter a cab if it already has one or more passengers
* Avoid using ridesharing apps

#### Ferries

Ferry services are connecting the various ports in the area, including to Djibouti. Vessels are frequently hijacked or attacked while crossing the Red sea, or in the coastal waters of the Gulf of Aden.

Avoid using ferries.

#### Piracy

There are pirate attacks and armed robberies against ships in coastal waters and, in some cases, farther out at sea. Mariners should take appropriate precautions.
