### Severe weather

In summer, sandstorms and dust storms occur in some areas. Sand-laden winds can blow at high speeds for days, creating difficult driving conditions. These storms can also cause respiratory problems, which can be fatal in some individuals.

If a dust storm is occurring:

* stay indoors
* keep windows closed

### Rainy season

The monsoon season extends from April to September. Seasonal flooding can slow down overland travel and reduce the delivery of essential services.

### Drought and flooding

Yemen has been facing drought in recent years, leading to crop failure and severe food shortages.

During the rainy season, torrential rains and heavy flooding occur regularly, especially in mountainous areas. Flooding often results in landslides that can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services, such as:

* transportation
* power distribution
* water and food supply
* telecommunications networks
* emergency services
* medical care

In the event of flooding:

* avoid the affected area
* exercise caution
* stay informed of the latest regional weather forecasts
* follow the instructions of emergency responders, including evacuation orders
