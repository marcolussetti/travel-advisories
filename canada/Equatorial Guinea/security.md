# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Border with Cameroon

The border with Cameroon is prone to violent clashes due to contested border areas. A cross-border pact was signed with Cameroon in 2020 to help resolve the issue but the border can still close unexpectedly.

Check the border status before travelling to the area.

### Crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing, purse snatching and theft from unattended vehicles, occurs.

Violent crimes, such as armed robbery and residential break-ins, occur, particularly in Bata and Malabo. The threat increases at night.

* Ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Avoid walking alone, especially after dark
* Do not carry large amounts of cash
* Remain vigilant near ATMs and banks, as there have been robberies targeting these facilities

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations must be approved by the government; therefore they rarely occur. Security forces have used tear gas to disperse crowds during illegal protests in the past.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Road safety

#### Road conditions

Road conditions are good throughout the country. Most roads are paved, but some may be poorly lit. Traffic signs are adequate.

#### Road safety

Drivers can be aggressive and reckless. They often drive at excessive speeds. Drinking and driving is prevalent.

* Avoid travel after dark
* Don’t pick up hitchhikers
* Keep doors locked and windows rolled up while driving
* Remain alert for pedestrians and livestock
* In the event of an accident, don’t move your vehicle until the police arrives

#### Roadblocks and checkpoints

Roadblocks and checkpoints are common, especially in and around the cities of Malabo and Bata.

It’s common for security forces to extort small bribes from motorists. If you are stopped:

* cooperate with local authorities
* carry proper identification at all times
* be prepared to explain the purpose of your travel
* when travelling outside of Bata and Malabo, carry a letter from your employer or other organization stating the purpose of your travel
* do not pay bribes, instead, request a citation that you can pay at a local court

### Public Transportation

Public transportation facilities are limited.

Public buses are not safe.

#### Taxis

Shared taxis (bush taxis) are a common way of getting around. However, they are poorly maintained and drivers are often reckless. There have been incidents of taxi drivers robbing their passengers.

* Avoid using taxis unless the driver is personally known or recommended to you
* Avoid sharing a taxi with strangers
* Ensure that the driver does not pick up other passengers along the way to your destination

### Fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud occurs in Equatorial Guinea. When using debit or credit cards:

* pay careful attention if other people are handling your cards
* use ATMs located in public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

### Women’s Safety

Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse.

### Swimming

Coastal waters can be dangerous. Riptides are common. Many beaches don’t offer warnings of dangerous conditions and they don’t always have lifeguards on duty.

Rescue services may not be consistent with international standards. Several drownings occur each year.

Follow the instructions and warnings of local authorities.

### Piracy

Pirate attacks and armed robbery against ships occur in coastal waters, and in some cases, farther out at sea.

Mariners should take appropriate precautions.
