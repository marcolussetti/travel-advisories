## Natural disasters and climate

The climate is hot and humid in Equatorial Guinea. Severe windstorms occur occasionally.

### Rainy season

On the mainland, there are two rainy seasons:

* from April to May
* from October to December

On Bioko Island, the rainy season extends from July to January.

Seasonal flooding can slow down overland travel and reduce the delivery of essential services. Roads may become impassable and bridges damaged.

If you travel to Equatorial Guinea during this time:

* keep up to date with the latest regional weather forecasts
* follow the advice and instructions of local authorities
