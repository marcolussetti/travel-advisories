# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Crime

The crime rate is very low. Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occasionally occurs. Use your hotel safe to store your valuables, but be sure it is bolted to the wall or the floor.

* Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Carry a photocopy of your passport’s identification page with you at all times
* Don’t bring valuables to the beach
* Don’t walk alone to deserted beaches or poorly lit areas after dark

### Women's safety

Sexual assaults occur. Women travelling alone may also be subject to certain forms of harassment and verbal abuse.

If you are the victim of a sexual assault, you should report it immediately to the nearest Canadian consulate or embassy. We also strongly advise that you file a report with the local police.

### Spiked foods and drinks

Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

### Recreational activities and excursions

Ensure that the recreational activities you choose are covered by your travel insurance and that sporting and aquatic equipment is safe and in good condition. Ensure helmets and life jackets are available, if applicable. Avoid excursions that are not recommended by tour operators.

### Cruises

The port of Grand Cayman is a cruise-ship stop.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations can occur. Even peaceful demonstrations can suddenly turn violent at any time. They may cause disruptions to services, to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstration
