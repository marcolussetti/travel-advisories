## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Sharia

Nigeria’s customs, laws and regulations closely adhere to Islamic practices and beliefs. Sharia has been adopted in the following 12 northern states:

* Bauchi
* Borno
* Gombe
* Jigawa
* Kaduna
* Kano
* Katsina
* Kebbi
* Niger
* Sokoto
* Yobe
* Zamfara

Sharia may be applicable to non-Muslims in some parts of the country. Transgressions could be punished by detention or other penalties.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect lengthy prison sentences and heavy fines.

### Ramadan

In 2026, the lunar month of Ramadan is expected to begin on or around February 17.

In public, between sunrise and sunset, be discreet when:

* drinking
* eating
* smoking

### Dress and behaviour

To avoid offending local sensitivities:

* dress conservatively
* behave discreetly
* respect religious and social traditions

In the north, women are advised to cover their legs and travel with a scarf to cover their head and arms when required.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Nigerian laws criminalize sexual acts and relationships between persons of the same sex.

The Same Sex Marriage (Prohibition) Act provides for lengthy jail sentences for offences related to entering same-sex marriages or civil unions, displaying same-sex amorous relationships, and participating in 2SLGBTQI+ organisations. In certain Northern states where Sharia is in effect, penalties can include the death sentence.

### Child sex tourism

It's a serious criminal offence to have sex with minors in Nigeria. Prison sentences are severe.

Canadians may also be subject to criminal proceedings in Canada for crimes of this nature committed while abroad.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Nigeria.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Nigeria by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Nigeria to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Money

The currency of Nigeria is the naira (NGN).

The Nigerian economy is cash-based. U.S. dollars are widely accepted. ATMs are not widely available outside of major cities.

Credit cards are accepted at some major hotels in Abuja and Lagos. However, you should avoid using credit and debit cards due to the high potential for fraud and other criminal activity.

The exportation of naira is limited by law to certain amounts.
