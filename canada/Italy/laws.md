## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Transfer to a Canadian prison

Canada and Italy are signatories to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in Italy to request a transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both Canadian and Italy authorities.

This process can take a long time, and there is no guarantee that the transfer will be approved by either or both sides.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect jail sentences or heavy fines.

### Public behaviour

Certain municipalities, particularly those with a high number of visitors, such as Rome, Florence and Venice, have adopted strict public conduct rules. Some actions that may seem inoffensive are illegal and you could face a fine or arrest if you do not respect the rules.

Public conduct rules may include:

* sitting, eating or drinking on a monument or an archaeological landmark
* bathing in fountains or canals
* walking in an urban setting in swimwear or without a shirt/T-shirt
* feeding pigeons
* putting locks on bridges or monuments
* dropping litter or using single-use plastic

### Natural heritage

You should not remove natural objects and plants from their natural setting. You could be fined if you do.

Removing pebbles, shells, or sand from the beaches in Sardinia and other coastal regions is prohibited.

In mountainous areas, it’s illegal to cut certain types of endangered flowers and disturb delicate alpine tundra.

### Photography

Photography of military installations and critical infrastructure is regulated.

Request permission from local authorities before taking photographs of such installations.

### Drones

Italian and European laws regulate recreational and commercial drone operation.

You must register your drone to use it across the European Union and apply for an authorization with the Italian authorities. Depending on the size of your drone and the intended use, you may also need to take a proof of competency exam.

Certain areas are restricted or off-limits for personal drones. These include:

* military sites
* within 5 km of airports
* mass gatherings, including major sporting events and concerts
* protected natural spaces, including natural parks

If you don’t comply, you may be fined and your drone confiscated.

### Identification

Local authorities may request to see your identification, including your passport, at any time.

* Always carry valid identification
* Keep a photocopy or a digital copy of your identification and passport in case they are lost or stolen

You will need to present your passport when you check-in to a hotel or other commercial accommodation.

Wait at the reception until the hotel staff has taken the required information from your passport and ensure that your passport is returned to you.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Italy.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Italy, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Italy.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Italy, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Italian court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Italy to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Driving

You may drive for up to one year with a valid Canadian driver’s licence, accompanied by an international driving permit or a certified Italian translation of your licence.

You must also have an international car insurance plan.

If you drive a foreign-registered car, you must display a sticker indicating its country of origin on the back of the car. It’s illegal to drive a vehicle registered abroad for more than 60 days. If you plan to stay in Italy for more than 60 days, you must obtain Italian plates.

#### Mandatory equipment

You must keep certain safety equipment in your car at all times, including a warning triangle and reflective jacket.

You must use snow tires or snow chains in certain regions during certain times of the year. If you plan to drive in the winter, you should verify in advance if your vehicle will require snow tires or chains. Pay attention to road signage during the winter, especially in mountainous regions.

#### Limited traffic zones and low-emission zones

Historic centres of many Italian cities have restricted traffic zones marked as ZTL. “Zona Traffico Limitato”, or low-emission zones, to reduce air pollution.

You need a special permit to access limited traffic zones. To be granted access to a low-emission zone, your car must meet certain environmental standards.

If you enter these zones without a permit, you could be fined. If you’re driving a rented vehicle, the rental agency may provide your contact details to the local authorities.

Some municipalities use the services of a private company to collect the fines abroad. You could receive traffic tickets by mail several months after returning to Canada.

* Pay close attention to street signage
* Confirm in advance how to access your hotel by vehicle if it’s located in a ZTL

### Regional regulations

Certain islands restrict or prohibit non-resident vehicles during the high tourism season and holiday season. These include:

* the Aeolian Islands (Alicudi, Filicudi, Lipari, Panarea, Salina, Stromboli, Vulcano)
* the Aegadian Islands (Favignana)
* the Campanian Archipelago (Capri, Ischia, Procida)
* the Pelagie Islands (Linosa)
* the Tuscan Archipelago (Giannutri, Giglio)
* Ustica

Other islands could enforce similar regulations. Confirm before travelling.

On route 163 of the Amalfi Coast, between Positano and Vietri sul Mare, it’s prohibited to use campervans or large recreational vehicles.

### Public transportation

You must validate your tickets on public transport before you start your journey, or pay on-board where possible to do so. If you don’t validate your ticket, you may receive an on-the-spot fine.

### Money

The currency of Italy is the euro (EUR).

Payment in cash is restricted to transactions under €1000.

If you are carrying €10,000 or more, or the equivalent in other currencies or monetary instruments, you must make a declaration to customs when you enter or leave the European Union.

This does not apply if you are travelling within the European Union or in transit to a non-EU country.
