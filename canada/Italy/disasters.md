## Natural disasters and climate

### Climate change

Climate change is affecting Italy. Extreme and unusual weather events are becoming more frequent and may affect your travel plans. Monitor local media for the latest information.

### Earthquakes

Italy is located in an active seismic zone. Even minor earthquakes can cause significant damage.

### Volcanoes

There are nine active volcanoes in Italy.

If you are travelling near active volcanoes:

* monitor levels of volcanic activity through the local media
* pay careful attention to all warnings issued
* follow the advice of local authorities
* be prepared to modify your travel arrangements or even evacuate the area on short notice

Some active volcanoes are continually monitored by Italian authorities and are located near densely populated urban areas or popular tourist destinations.

#### Sicily

Mount Etna is Europe’s most active volcano. Periods of high activity can bring significant ash fall, earthquakes and emission of harmful gases.

#### Aeolian Islands

The Stromboli and Vulcano islands are active volcanoes. Eruptions, ash fall and lava flow occur regularly.

#### Campania region

Mount Vesuvius and the Phlegraean Fields in the Naples area are active volcanoes.

### Wildfires

Forest and maquis fires often occur during the summer months, particularly in Sicily, Calabria and Sardinia.

The air quality in areas near active fires may deteriorate due to heavy smoke.

In case of a major fire:

* stay away from the affected area, particularly if you suffer from respiratory ailments
* follow the instructions of local emergency services personnel, including evacuation orders
* monitor local media for up-to-date information on the situation

### Flooding and landslides

Heavy rains, particularly in the fall and winter, can cause severe flooding and landslides. Roads may become impassable, and infrastructure damaged.

Certain areas of northern and central Italy are especially prone to seasonal flooding, including:

* Emilia-Romagna
* Veneto
* Liguria
* Tuscany

Venice, in Veneto Region, sees tidal flooding known as “acqua alta,” particularly in the fall and spring. The city of Venice maintains a warning system for tidal flooding, and local authorities may install raised or floating platforms to allow pedestrians to cross low-lying areas.

The Italian Civil Protection Department publishes weather alerts on its website.

* Exercise caution, particularly around major rivers
* Stay informed of the latest regional weather forecasts
* Follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders

### Avalanches

In mountainous areas, avalanches present a risk and could result in fatalities. They often make roads impassable and cause power disruptions. These conditions can affect access to isolated areas, including tourist resorts, and limit the ability of emergency services to respond.

If you plan on skiing or mountaineering:

* stay informed of weather and safety conditions
* follow the instructions of local authorities
