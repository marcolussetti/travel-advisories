### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and bag snatching, occurs frequently. Thieves often target tourists.

Criminals may try to distract you and take your attention away from your valuables or belongings. Be cautious of distraction tactics, including people who:

* spill drinks on you or your belongings
* engage you in lengthy conversations
* persistently offer to assist you
* attempt to distance you from your personal belongings

Burglaries and home break-ins occur, including from holiday homes and rentals.

Theft is particularly common in crowded public areas such as:

* popular tourist areas and historical sites
* buses, trains, bus and train stations, and airports
* hotel lobbies
* restaurants, including outdoor seating areas
* beaches

During your trip:

* keep your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, in a secure place
* do not show signs of affluence or wear expensive jewellery
* do not carry large sums of cash or valuables unnecessarily
* be aware of your surroundings, especially in busy tourist areas
* be wary of unsolicited offers or advice from strangers
* keep doors and windows locked when you are away

Vehicle theft and theft from parked vehicles occur. Thieves often target rental cars. Criminals on scooters or on foot often snatch bags and other valuables from pedestrians and from inside cars stopped at traffic lights.

If you plan on driving during your stay:

* keep your windows closed and car doors locked at all times
* keep bags and other valuables out of the reach of pedestrians
* never leave belongings unattended in a vehicle, even in the trunk

#### Sexual assault

Sexual assaults have occurred, including against foreign women.

The Italian Government operates 1522, a 24/7 public utility number with multilingual operators to respond to the needs of victims of gender-based violence and stalking.

If you are the victim of a sexual assault, you may report it immediately to the nearest Government of Canada office. You can also report the assault to the police (Polizia di Stato) or seek medical attention by calling 112.

### Jubilee 2025

The Jubilee, also known as the Holy Year, will take place in Rome from December 24, 2024, to January 6, 2026.

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in Europe. Terrorists have carried out attacks in several European cities and further attacks elsewhere in Europe are likely. Attacks in Italy cannot be ruled out.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places. Be particularly vigilant if attending sporting events and during religious holidays and other public celebrations, as terrorists have used such occasions to mount attacks.

The Government of Italy maintains a public alert system on terrorism. Alert level changes are communicated mainly through local media. Enhanced security measures are also deployed in various strategic locations and transport hubs.

Expect increased police and military presence during holidays and in public places, including tourist locations and major landmarks.

### Spiked food and drinks

Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

### Victims of crime

You can report a crime at the nearest police station (Carabinieri or Polizia di Stato).

It’s possible to file a preliminary complaint online, in Italian, for certain types of minor crimes, including theft.

### Fraud

#### Credit card, debit card and ATM fraud

Credit and debit card as well as ATM fraud occurs.

The risk of credit card skimming is high. Businesses may use compromised ATMs or PIN readers to collect your credit card information, especially in popular tourist areas.

When using your debit or credit card:

* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* pay careful attention when others are handling your cards
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* use ATMs located in public areas or inside a bank or business
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

#### Cybercrime

Cybercrime occurs. Criminals may compromise public Wi-Fi networks to steal your personal data or credit information.

* Be cautious when posting information or photos on social media
* Use secure public Wi-Fi networks
* Always meet new acquaintances in a secure and familiar location
* Do not discuss travel plans or any other personal information within earshot of strangers

### Demonstrations and strikes

Demonstrations and strikes occur regularly, particularly in larger cities and often with little notice.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to significant disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Adventure tourism

Outdoor activities, such as hiking, skiing, mountain biking and other alpine and extreme sports, can be dangerous.

If you intend to participate in adventure tourism activities:

* share your itinerary with a friend or family member if you’re alone
* stay on marked trails and consider hiring an experienced guide from a reputable company
* buy travel insurance that covers incidents related to this type of recreational activity
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to tackle the challenges of your activity
* know the symptoms of acute altitude sickness, dehydration and heatstroke, which can be fatal
* ensure that you have proper equipment and bring sufficient water
* monitor weather conditions and other possible hazards

### Water activities

#### Swimming

Always respect warning flags at beaches.

Be cautious on the beach and in the water during fall and winter. Waves can be unpredictable, break closer to the shore than expected and cause strong riptides.

* Monitor weather conditions
* Avoid beaches and coastal areas if the weather forecast is poor
* Pay attention to erosion and rockfall warnings
* Do not dive in unfamiliar waters as hidden rocks or shallow water can cause serious injury or death

#### Boating

Coastal waters can be dangerous. Waters in the Strait of Bonifacio, between Corsica and Sardinia, and the Strait of Messina, between Sicily and mainland Italy, can be difficult to navigate due to strong winds and currents.

If you’re planning on going boating or taking a boat tour:

* have life jackets available and accessible for all passengers
* don't board vessels that appear overloaded or unseaworthy
* carry a VHF marine radio or GPS transmitter to share your location in case of emergency

### Roads

#### Road safety

Road safety may vary throughout the country. Minor accidents are common.

#### Road conditions

Roads are generally in good condition in and around major cities. In rural areas, they may be poorly maintained. City streets can be narrow and congested. Signage, traffic lights and road markings may not be visible, especially in southern areas of the country.

In mountainous areas, roads are often winding and narrow. Avalanches or landslides occur and can block access routes to towns and ski resorts.

Driving can also be dangerous due to:

* traffic jams and heavy traffic, especially in urban areas
* lack of traffic signs

#### Driving habits

Drivers do not always respect traffic laws, especially motorcycles and scooters, which often drive between vehicles and on sidewalks. Speeding is common.

If you choose to drive during your stay:

* always drive defensively
* plan your trip in advance, especially if you are visiting a rural area
* do not stop on the road to offer help to others
* do not hitchhike or pick up hitchhikers

### Public transportation

The reliability of public transportation services varies across the country.

#### Taxis

In Italy, drivers start the meter at the point of departure rather than at pick-up. Ride-sharing and cab-hailing services are available but may operate differently.

Use only officially licensed taxis from a stand or requested by phone or app. Official taxis have a white “TAXI” sign on the roof of the vehicle.

* Never share a taxi with strangers
* Discuss the fare in advance or make sure the meter is on
