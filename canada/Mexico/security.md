## Safety and security

### Sinaloa (see [Risk levels](#risk))

Violent clashes occur regularly between rival armed groups in the State of Sinaloa, including in Culiacán and parts of Mazatlán located outside the main tourist zones. Armed groups have stopped vehicles on the highway from Culiácan to Mazatlán and other major roads.

If you are in an area of Sinaloa where we advise to avoid non-essential travel:

* exercise extreme caution
* limit your movements
* monitor local media for the latest information
* follow the instructions of local authorities

[More information on organized crime](https://travel.gc.ca/destinations/mexico#organizedcrime)

### Crime

Levels of crime, particularly violent crime, are high throughout Mexico.

If you’re a victim of a crime, you must report it immediately to local authorities. Criminal investigations require that a formal complaint be made in person. You should hire a local lawyer to represent your interests and follow up on your case after you return to Canada. Failure to do so may result in incomplete investigations or long delays in bringing cases to trial.

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, is common in Mexico. Remain vigilant in airports, bus stations, buses and the Mexico City metro system.

* Be aware of your surroundings at all times,
* Keep your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, in a secure place
* Don’t show signs of affluence or wear expensive jewellery

#### Organized crime

Criminal groups, including drug cartels, are very active across the country. ‎Clashes between cartels or gangs over territory, drugs and smuggling routes are common. Armed clashes between security forces and drug cartels can occur without warning.

In some parts of the country, the military, the navy and federal police forces have been deployed to maintain a visible presence and combat organized crime to improve security conditions.

If you plan on travelling to Mexico:

* be vigilant
* don’t show signs of affluence
* stay in tourist areas
* be very cautious on the roads, including major highways
* avoid travelling at night
* research your destination thoroughly
* monitor local media for the latest information

#### Tourist areas

Mexican authorities have made efforts to protect major tourist destinations, resulting in lower levels of gang-related violence in these areas. However, incidents of violent crime still occur in major cities, popular tourist areas and resorts. Fighting between criminal gangs and cartels has taken place in:

* restaurants
* hotels
* nightclubs

Innocent bystanders have been injured or killed. You may be in the wrong place at the wrong time and become a victim of violent crime.

#### Border areas

Criminal activity and violence occur regularly in border areas. Confrontations between organized criminal groups and Mexican security forces continue to pose a risk. Shootouts, attacks and illegal roadblocks may occur without warning.

The situation is tense in the border area between:

* Mexico and the United States
* Mexico and Guatemala

You should travel to Mexico by air to avoid criminal incidents at international land border crossings.

If you plan to cross an international land border:

* remain extremely vigilant
* use only official border crossings
* avoid travelling at night

#### Armed robbery

Armed robbery occurs frequently. Criminals sometimes follow a victim after they exchange or withdraw money.

Criminals on motorcycles often rob other motorists and pedestrians on the roads.

* Don’t show signs of affluence
* Stay in hotels and resorts with good security
* Keep your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, in a secure place
* Don't resist an attack
* Rent cars without stickers or other advertisements for the rental company
* Ensure that you only stop in major centres, at reputable hotels or at secure campsites
* Avoid withdrawing or exchanging money in public areas of the airport
* Don’t leave valuables in the vehicle

#### Assault

Canadian travellers have been physically and sexually assaulted. In some cases, hotel employees, taxi drivers and security personnel at popular tourist destinations were involved. Sometimes, hotel staff are not helpful and try to dissuade victims from reporting the incident to the police.

There are reports of individuals posing as police officers and driving cars resembling police vehicles committing:

* robberies
* physical assault
* sexual assault

If you are in Mexico:

* avoid walking after dark
* avoid deserted streets at night and isolated areas

#### Carjackings

Carjacking is common on roads along the Pacific coast and northern borders. Criminals mainly target:

* camper vans
* sport utility vehicles
* pickup trucks

If you believe that you’re being followed, go directly to a police station.

#### Kidnappings

Kidnappings, including express kidnappings, occur frequently throughout Mexico. Kidnappers have targeted foreigners, including Canadians.

If you're kidnapped:

* comply with the kidnappers’ requests
* don’t resist

Express kidnappings may occur in large urban areas. Criminals kidnap the victim from the street or a taxi and force the person to withdraw funds from an ATM. Victims may be held overnight to make a second withdrawal after midnight. Thieves often work in cooperation with or pose as taxi drivers.

* Only use reputable cab companies or ride-sharing apps
* Avoid hailing taxis on the street
* If you're threatened by armed criminals, stay calm and don’t resist

#### Home break-ins

Tourists staying in private and rental homes have been the victims of break-ins and burglaries. Make sure you lock windows and doors securely.

### Fraud

#### Timeshares

Disputes over timeshare arrangements occur. Timeshare sales representatives may be very persistent and often use pressure tactics to make a sale.

Members of criminal groups often pose as real estate representatives offering to buy your property for large amounts for use as a timeshare. They may never pay for the property or charge high administrative fees.

You're legally entitled to cancel a timeshare contract without penalty within 5 working days. It's illegal for timeshare companies to ask you to sign a waiver that prevents you from cancelling a contract. To cancel your contract, you must write directly to the timeshare company.

Before purchasing a timeshare:

* carefully review the contract
* consult a Mexican attorney
* only provide your credit card number if you are sure you want to make the purchase
* keep copies of all correspondence

If you suspect fraud in the real estate procedures, contact the Federal Attorney’s Office of Consumer immediately.

#### Online scams

Travellers fall victim to online scams, including phishing emails and romance scams. Certain scams target senior citizens.

 Scam victims are subject to:

* coercion into acting as a drug or money courier for criminal groups
* kidnapping
* forced money transfers and withdrawals of funds

Before travelling to Mexico to visit someone you met online:

* be wary of individuals who ask you to carry a package from Mexico on their behalf
* beware of people who show a keen interest in you online

#### Credit card and ATM fraud

Credit and debit card as well as ATM fraud occurs frequently.

When using your debit or credit card:

* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* don't withdraw large sums of cash
* pay careful attention when others are handling your cards
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* use ATMs located in public areas or inside a bank or business

Certain establishments, such as bars or nightclubs, may try to overcharge you.

Discussions about overcharging have turned violent. Tourists have been threatened and forced to pay the bill.

* Always confirm the price of an item before ordering
* Do not leave an open tab
* Avoid giving your credit card to bar or restaurant staff
* Check your bill for accuracy before paying

### Extortion

Extortion schemes are common in Mexico. Incidences of virtual kidnappings are increasing and are more common than traditional forms of kidnapping.

#### Virtual kidnappings

Virtual kidnappings are a form of extortion. Victims are neither captured nor detained. Criminals use threats and knowledge of their victim’s personal information to create the impression of a kidnapping and demand ransom from the victim’s friends and family.

Criminals gather information on their victims from a variety of sources, including:

* social media
* watching and eavesdropping on conversations
* phone theft or hacking

Criminals use many tactics in virtual kidnapping. Many of these tactics involve criminals calling potential victims in their hotel rooms, posing as their friends or family members in distress, posing as government officials or claiming to represent criminal gangs.

 Always protect your personal information, both in person and over communications networks.

* When you answer the phone, wait for the caller to speak
* If the caller asks who is speaking, you're threatened on the phone or hear screams, hang up immediately and report the call to the authorities
* Don't discuss travel plans, your room number or any other personal information with strangers
* Never leave your cell phone unattended
* Ensure your cellphone is password protected and enable two-step verification for your applications
* Don't share personal details to strangers in person, over the phone or on social media, especially when using hotel phones
* Don’t admit visitors to your room

If you believe a friend or family member is the victim of a virtual kidnapping, you should contact the Government of Canada to verify if the kidnapping is legitimate before taking any action or sending ransom money.

#### Police corruption

Legitimate police officers have demanded money from tourists or arrested tourists for minor offences such as:

* drinking alcohol on the street
* public urination
* traffic violations

They have requested immediate cash payment in exchange for their release. This practice is common in tourist areas.

If this occurs:

* don’t hand over your money or your passport
* ask for the officer’s name, badge and patrol car number
* ask for a copy of the written fine, which is payable at a later date, or insist on going to the nearest police station

### Women’s safety

Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse.

Some incidents of assault, rape and sexual assault against Canadian women have occurred, including at beach resorts and on public buses.

* Always remain vigilant
* Do not accept offers of transportation from strangers
* Avoid walking alone at night

[Advice for women travellers](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/advice-for-women-travellers)

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Mexican law does not prohibit sexual acts between individuals of the same sex. However, homosexuality is not widely accepted in Mexican society, particularly in rural areas.

2SLGBTQI+ persons could be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression or sex characteristics. Transgender and gender non-conforming individuals are disproportionately targeted for violence and can face discrimination.

[Travel and your sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and sex characteristics](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/lgbt-travel)

### Spiked food and drinks

There are reports of criminals adding drugs into items that could put you at risk of sexual assault or robbery.

Items include:

* food and drinks
* gum
* cigarettes

Incidents are most likely to occur:

* in nightclubs
* in bars and restaurants
* on public transportation, including taxis on the street

While you’re in Mexico

* be wary of accepting these items from new acquaintances
* never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers
* order drinks in sealed bottles or cans instead of in plastic cups

#### Unregulated alcohol

Some bars, restaurants and resorts have served unregulated alcohol. Some travellers have reported getting sick or blacking out after drinking alcohol.

* Buy alcohol from reputable establishments
* Seek medical assistance if you begin to feel sick

[Alcohol, drugs and travel](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/drugs)

### Balconies

Mexico's standards for the height of balcony railings are considerably lower than those in Canada. Falls have resulted in deaths and injuries. Exercise caution when standing close to balcony railings.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations occur frequently, especially in Mexico City, and roadblocks are common during demonstrations. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation, as well as airport closures.

It’s illegal for foreigners to conduct political activity in Mexico, including participating in demonstrations. If you participate in demonstrations as a foreigner, you may face detention, deportation, and the denial of future entry into Mexico.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

[Mass gatherings (large-scale events)](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/mass-gatherings)

### Water activities

#### Swimming

Coastal waters can be dangerous. Riptides are common and powerful waves make swimming and water sports dangerous. Several drownings occur each year.

Many beaches don’t have warning flags to indicate unsafe conditions and they don’t always have lifeguards on duty.

Lifeguard services do not always meet Canadian standards.

* Consult local residents and tour operators for information on possible hazards and safe swimming areas
* Respect the areas reserved for swimming
* Follow the instructions of local authorities

#### Water sports

Tour operators do not always comply with Canadian standards, and many don’t conduct regular safety checks on their equipment.

Canadians have been involved in accidents where operators of recreational vehicles demand compensation exceeding the value of the damage caused to the vehicle or equipment.

If you undertake water sports:

* use a reputable company
* make sure that your travel insurance covers incidents related to this type of recreational activity
* wear appropriate safety equipment, such as helmets and life jackets
* do not use the equipment if you are unsure of its safety
* do not dive if you have been drinking alcohol or using other substances

[Water safety abroad](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/water-safety)

### Adventure travel

Outdoor activities, including hiking, mountain biking, scuba diving, and other extreme sports can be dangerous.

Tour operators may not meet Canadian safety standards.

If you intend to participate in adventure travel activities:

* share your itinerary with a friend or family member if you’re alone
* stay on marked trails and consider hiring an experienced guide from a reputable company
* buy travel insurance that covers incidents related to this type of recreational activity
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to tackle the challenges of your activity
* ensure that you have proper equipment and bring sufficient water
* monitor weather conditions and other possible hazards
* refrain from using equipment if you are unsure of its condition or safety

### Power outages

Mexico sometimes experiences power shortages.

Power outages could impact essential services, such as:

* public transportation, including flights
* medical services
* the public water supply
* telecommunications
* banking transactions
* the supply of basic necessities

### Telecommunications

The telecommunications network is not reliable in rural areas.

Canadian cell phones generally work in major cities.

### Roads

#### Road safety

Fatal accidents are frequent.

Police don’t strictly enforce traffic laws, including for drinking and driving. Police don’t regularly patrol the highways. Crime is common on highways, especially in rural areas.

Toll highways are typically better maintained than secondary highways.

* Only use frequented rest areas and gas stations
* Avoid travelling after dark

* [Pre-paid toll card](https://www.pase.com.mx/) (in Spanish)

#### Road conditions

Road conditions vary greatly throughout the country. Many common hazards, including construction and speed bumps, are unmarked and many roads or exits are unsigned.

Road conditions can be dangerous, especially on rural roads, due to:

* abandoned vehicles blocking the road
* potholes
* sharp curves
* slow-moving vehicles
* stray livestock

#### Driving habits

Drivers don’t always respect traffic laws and often:

* drive at excessive speeds
* drive aggressive or reckless
* don’t use signals to indicate turns or lane changes
* don’t routinely stop at pedestrian crosswalks

Vehicles and bicycles often operate without sufficient lights and reflectors.

#### Illegal Roadblocks

Illegal roadblocks are common. Heavily armed gangs have attacked travellers on intercity highways who fail to stop or pay a ‘toll’.

If you are threatened by criminals, stay calm and don’t resist.

#### Checkpoints

The military and federal police search for drugs and firearms at checkpoints throughout the country.

### Public transportation

Some public and private vehicles are poorly maintained.

#### Metro

The Mexico City metro is often very crowded and a popular place for pickpocketing. During rush hour, there are metro cars reserved for women and children at the front of the trains.

#### Buses

The Metrobus in Mexico City is generally reliable. There are sections reserved for women and children at the front of the buses.

Crime is common on intercity buses.

* Don’t use mini buses
* Take direct bus routes
* Only use bus companies that offer VIP or executive class transportation travelling on toll roads
* Travel only during daylight hours
* Do not carry large sums of cash
* Exercise caution at bus stations

#### Taxis

In Mexico City, all government-authorized taxis have licence plates starting with “A” or “B.” Taxis from designated stands have a company logo and licence plate number on the side of the car.

Official taxis in Mexico City are pink and white. Users can reserve these taxis on the CDMX app. Credit card fraud occurs. Drivers may charge excessive amounts, sometimes without customers' knowledge.

* Only use officially marked taxis
* Avoid hailing taxis on the street
* Never share a cab with strangers
* Avoid using your credit or debit card
* Have small bills available for payment

If you wish to pay by credit or debit card when taking a taxi from an airport in Mexico, it is safer to do book and pre-pay either inside the terminal, or at the designated boarding area outside when your taxi is assigned.

[My taxi](https://taxi.cdmx.gob.mx/mi-taxi) – CDMX app (in Spanish)

#### Ridesharing services

Ridesharing apps are available at some airports.

Disputes between taxi and ride-share service drivers may occur. Although tourists have not been targeted, you may be caught up in these incidents and be harassed or injured.

If you use a ride-sharing app:

* confirm the driver’s identity and license plate before getting in the car
* use the security features in rideshare apps

### Piracy

Pirates commit attacks and armed robberies against ships in coastal waters in the Bay of Campeche. Travellers should take appropriate precautions.
