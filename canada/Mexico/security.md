## Safety and security

### Violent incidents in various parts of Mexico

On February 22, 2026, criminal groups set up roadblocks with burning vehicles in several cities in various parts of Mexico. There were shootouts with security forces and explosions, including on roads and highways connecting affected areas to Mexico city.

Security incidents took place in a number of locations, especially in the following states:

* Jalisco, including Guadalajara and Puerto Vallarta
* Guerrero, including Acapulco
* Nayarit
* Michoacán
* Sinaloa, including Mazatlán
* Quintana Roo, including Cancun
* Baja California, including Tijuana and Tecate

While the security situation has stabilized in these areas since February 22, further incidents are possible in these locations and in other areas across Mexico.

Local authorities are reopening roads and reinforcing security around Guadalajara and Puerto Vallarta. Airports in Puerto Vallarta and Guadalajara are open, domestic flights resumed on February 23, and international flights resumed on February 24. Shelter in place orders have been lifted.

Travel to the airport only if you have a confirmed flight, and it is safe to do so. Confirm the status of your flight before you leave to the airport, as there may be delays or changes in flight schedules. Give yourself extra time to get there and plan to arrive early.

* If your travel plans have been disrupted, contact your airline or travel agent for more information
* Follow the advice of local authorities
* Monitor local and international media to stay informed of the situation

### FIFA World Cup 2026™

Canada, Mexico and the United States will be hosting the FIFA World Cup from June 11 to July 19, 2026. If you plan on travelling to Mexico for the tournament, consult our [Advice for Canadians travelling to Mexico – FIFA World Cup 2026™](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/campaigns/soccer-2026-mexico).

### Sinaloa (see [Risk levels](#risk))

Violent clashes occur regularly between rival armed groups in the state of Sinaloa, including in Culiacán and parts of Mazatlán located outside the main tourist zones. Armed groups have stopped vehicles on the highway from Culiácan to Mazatlán and other major roads.

If you are in an area of Sinaloa where we advise to avoid non-essential travel:

* exercise extreme caution
* limit your movements
* monitor local media for the latest information
* follow the instructions of local authorities

### Crime

Levels of crime, particularly violent crime, are high throughout Mexico.

If you’re a victim of a crime, regardless of the nature, you should report it by making a formal complaint in person at the nearest prosecutor’s office (known as Ministerio Público or Fiscalía) before you leave the country. Insurance companies usually request a formal report before providing reimbursement. You should hire a local lawyer to represent your interests and follow up on your case after you return to Canada. Failure to do so may result in incomplete investigations or long delays in bringing cases to trial.

#### Tourist areas

Mexican authorities have made efforts to protect major tourist destinations, resulting in lower levels of gang-related violence in these areas. However, violent crime still occurs in major cities, popular tourist areas and resorts. Fighting between criminal gangs and cartels has taken place in:

* hotels
* nightclubs
* restaurants

Remain vigilant, since innocent bystanders have been injured or killed. You may be in the wrong place at the wrong time and become a victim of violent crime.

#### Border areas

Criminal activity and violence occur regularly in border areas. Confrontations between organized criminal groups and Mexican security forces continue to pose a risk. Shootouts, attacks and illegal roadblocks may occur without warning.

The situation is tense in the border areas between:

* Mexico and the United States
* Mexico and Guatemala

You should travel to Mexico by air to avoid criminal incidents at international land border crossings.

If you cross a land border:

* only cross at official borders
* account for possible delays at the border
* avoid travelling after dark

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and bag snatching, occurs frequently.

Criminals on motorcycles often rob other motorists and pedestrians on the roads.

Remain vigilant:

* in airports
* at bus stations
* onboard buses
* on the Mexico City metro
* during mass gatherings such as concerts and sporting events

During your trip:

* be aware of your surroundings, especially in busy tourist areas
* keep your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, in a secure place
* do not show signs of affluence or wear expensive jewellery
* do not leave valuables in your car or rental car, including in the trunk

[Lost or stolen belongings abroad](https://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/stolen-belongings)

#### Organized crime

Criminal groups, including drug cartels, are very active across the country. ‎Clashes between cartels or gangs over territory, drugs and smuggling routes are common. Armed clashes between security forces and drug cartels can occur without warning.

In some parts of the country, the military, the navy and federal police forces have been deployed to maintain a visible presence and combat organized crime to improve security conditions.

#### Armed robberies

Armed robberies occur frequently. Criminals sometimes follow a victim after they exchange or withdraw money.

* Do not resist an attack
* Rent cars without stickers or other advertisements for the rental company
* Ensure that you only stop in major centres, at reputable hotels or at secure campsites
* Avoid withdrawing or exchanging money in public areas of the airport

#### Assaults

Canadian travellers have been physically and sexually assaulted. In some cases, hotel employees, taxi drivers and security personnel at popular tourist destinations were involved. Sometimes, hotel staff are not helpful and try to dissuade victims from reporting the incident to the police.

There are reports of individuals posing as police officers and driving cars resembling police vehicles committing assault.

During your stay:

* avoid going out after dark
* avoid isolated areas
* travel in groups

[Are you a victim of sexual violence?](https://canadainmexico.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SGBV-En-Digital.pdf) – Government of Canada and British Embassy in Mexico City

#### Carjackings

Carjackings are common on roads along the Pacific coast and northern borders. Criminals mainly target:

* camper vans
* sport utility vehicles
* pickup trucks

If you believe that you’re being followed, go directly to a police station.

#### Kidnappings

Kidnappings, including express kidnappings, occur frequently throughout Mexico. Kidnappers have targeted foreigners, including Canadians.

If attacked, stay calm and do not resist, as criminals often carry weapons and may become violent.

Express kidnappings, where kidnappers demand small, immediate ransoms, may occur in large urban areas. Criminals kidnap the victim from the street or a taxi and force the person to withdraw funds from an ATM. The victim is sometimes held overnight so that a second withdrawal can be made the next day. Thieves often work in cooperation with, or pose as, taxi drivers.

* Only use reputable taxi companies or ride-sharing applications
* Avoid hailing taxis on the street

#### Home break-ins

Tourists staying in private and rental homes have been the victims of break-ins and burglaries.

* Stay in accommodations with adequate security measures
* Keep doors and windows locked at all times

### Fraud

#### Timeshares

Disputes over timeshare arrangements occur. Timeshare sales representatives may be very persistent and often use pressure tactics to make a sale.

Members of criminal groups often pose as real estate representatives offering to buy your property for large amounts for use as a timeshare. They may never pay for the property or charge high administrative fees.

You’re legally entitled to cancel a timeshare contract without penalty within 5 working days. It’s illegal for timeshare companies to ask you to sign a waiver that prevents you from cancelling a contract. To cancel your contract, you must write directly to the timeshare company.

Before purchasing a timeshare:

* carefully review the contract
* consult a Mexican attorney
* only provide your credit card number if you are sure you want to make the purchase
* keep copies of all correspondence

If you suspect fraud in the real estate procedures, contact the Federal Consumer Protection Office immediately.

#### Online scams

Travellers have fallen victim to online scams, including phishing emails and romance scams. Certain scams target senior citizens.

 Scam victims can be subject to:

* coercion into acting as a drug or money courier for criminal groups
* kidnapping
* forced money transfers and withdrawals of funds

Before travelling to Mexico to visit someone you met online:

* be wary of individuals who ask you to carry a package from Mexico on their behalf
* beware of people who show a keen interest in you online

#### Credit card, debit card and ATM fraud

Credit and debit card as well as ATM fraud occurs frequently.

When using your debit or credit card:

* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* do not withdraw large sums of cash
* pay careful attention when others are handling your cards
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* use ATMs located in public areas or inside a bank or business
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

[Overseas fraud](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/overseas-fraud)

#### Overcharging

Certain establishments, such as bars or nightclubs, may try to overcharge you.

Discussions about overcharging have turned violent. Tourists have been threatened and forced to pay the bill.

* Always confirm the price of an item before ordering
* Do not leave an open tab
* Avoid giving your credit card to bar or restaurant staff
* Check the accuracy of your bill before paying

### Extortion

#### Virtual kidnappings

Virtual kidnappings are a form of extortion. Victims are neither captured nor detained, but they could be unreachable. Criminals use threats and knowledge of their victim’s personal information to create the impression of a kidnapping and demand ransom from the victim’s friends and family.

Criminals use many tactics in virtual kidnapping. Many of these tactics involve criminals calling potential victims in their hotel rooms, posing as their friends or family members in distress, as government officials, or claiming to represent criminal gangs.

Always protect your personal information, both in person and over communications networks.

* When you answer the phone, wait for the caller to speak
* If the caller asks who is speaking, you’re threatened on the phone or hear screams, hang up immediately and report the call to the authorities
* Do not discuss travel plans, your room number or any other personal information with strangers
* Never leave your cell phone unattended
* Ensure your cellphone is password protected and enable two-step verification for your applications
* Do not share personal details with strangers in person, over the phone or on social media, especially when using hotel phones
* Do not admit visitors to your room

If you believe a friend or family member is the victim of a virtual kidnapping, you should contact the Government of Canada for consular assistance.

#### Police corruption

Legitimate police officers have demanded money from tourists or arrested them for minor offences such as:

* drinking alcohol on the street
* public urination
* traffic violations

They have requested immediate cash payment in exchange for their release. This practice is common in tourist areas.

If this occurs:

* do not hand over your money or your passport
* ask for the officer’s name, badge and patrol car number
* advise the officer that you’ll call 911
* ask for a copy of the written fine, which is payable at a later date, or insist on going to the nearest police station

You have the right to contact a lawyer for legal assistance or the Embassy of Canada for consular assistance.

### Women’s safety

Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse.

Incidents of physical and sexual assault against Canadian women have occurred, including at beach resorts and on public buses.

If you’re the victim of a sexual assault, you should report it immediately to 911 and the nearest Government of Canada office.

* Always remain vigilant
* Do not accept offers of transportation from strangers
* Avoid walking alone after dark

[Advice for women travellers](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/advice-for-women-travellers "Advice for women travellers")

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Mexican law does not prohibit sexual acts between individuals of the same sex. However, homosexuality is not widely accepted in Mexican society, particularly in rural areas.

2SLGBTQI+ persons could be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression or sex characteristics. Transgender and gender non-conforming individuals are disproportionately targeted for violence and can face discrimination.

[Travel and your sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and sex characteristics](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/lgbt-travel)

### Spiked food, drinks and other items

Criminals sometimes add drugs to items that could put you at risk of sexual assault or robbery. There have also been cases of eye drops being added to victims’ drinks, poisoning the victims, and the victims being robbed after becoming unconscious.

Items include:

* food and drinks
* gum
* cigarettes

Incidents are most likely to occur:

* in nightclubs
* in bars and restaurants
* on public transportation, including taxis hailed on the street

While you’re in Mexico:

* be wary of accepting these items from new acquaintances
* never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers
* order drinks in sealed bottles or cans instead of in plastic cups

#### Unregulated alcohol

Some bars, restaurants and resorts have served unregulated alcohol. Some travellers have reported getting sick or blacking out after drinking alcohol.

* Buy alcohol from reputable establishments
* Seek medical assistance if you begin to feel sick

[Drugs, alcohol and travel](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/drugs)

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations occur frequently, especially in Mexico City, and roadblocks are common during demonstrations. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation, as well as airport closures.

It’s illegal for foreigners to conduct political activity in Mexico, including participating in demonstrations. If you participate in demonstrations as a foreigner, you may face detention, deportation and the denial of future entry into Mexico.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

[Mass gatherings (large-scale events)](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/mass-gatherings)

### Balconies

Mexico’s standards for the height of balcony railings are considerably lower than those in Canada. People have been injured or killed after falling from balconies.

Exercise caution when standing close to balcony railings.

### Water activities

Coastal waters can be dangerous. Riptides are common. Tidal changes and strong winds can cause dangerous riptides. Several drownings occur each year.

Beaches are not always supervised. Lifeguard services do not always meet Canadian standards.

Many beaches don’t have warning flags to alert of unsafe conditions.

* Consult local residents and tour operators for information on possible hazards, the presence of dangerous species and safe swimming areas
* Respect the areas reserved for swimming
* Follow the instructions of local authorities

### Adventure travel

Outdoor activities, such as hiking, mountain biking, scuba diving, skydiving, paragliding and other extreme sports, can be dangerous.

Tour operators may not meet Canadian safety standards.

Canadians have been involved in accidents where operators of recreational vehicles demand compensation exceeding the value of the damage caused to the vehicle or equipment.

If you intend to participate in adventure travel activities:

* share your itinerary with a friend or family member if you’re alone
* stay on marked trails and consider hiring an experienced guide from a reputable company
* buy travel insurance that covers incidents related to these types of recreational activities
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to tackle the challenges of your activity
* ensure that you have proper equipment and bring sufficient water
* monitor weather conditions and other possible hazards
* refrain from using equipment if you are unsure of its condition or safety

### Power outages

Power outages occur occasionally.

Power outages could impact essential services, such as:

* public transportation, including flights
* medical services
* the public water supply
* telecommunications
* banking transactions
* the supply of basic necessities

### Telecommunications

The telecommunications network is not reliable in rural areas.

Canadian cell phones generally work in major cities.

[Using data plans outside Canada](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/mobiles-abroad)

### Roads

#### Road safety

Road safety is poor throughout the country.

Fatal accidents are frequent.

Police don’t strictly enforce traffic laws, including for drinking and driving. They don’t regularly patrol the highways. Crime is common on highways, especially in rural areas.

* Only use frequented rest areas and gas stations
* Avoid travelling after dark
* Only use toll roads and highways
* Fill your gas tank before you travel
* Always keep doors and windows closed and locked
* Do not hitchhike or pick up hitchhikers

* [Pre-paid toll card](https://www.pase.com.mx/) (Spanish only)

#### Road conditions

Road conditions vary greatly throughout the country.

Toll highways (with a “D” after the number) are typically safer and better maintained than secondary highways.

Road conditions can be dangerous, especially on rural roads, due to:

* unmarked construction sites and speed bumps
* abandoned vehicles blocking the road
* potholes
* sharp curves
* slow-moving vehicles
* stray livestock

#### Driving habits

Drivers don’t always respect traffic laws. They can be aggressive and reckless towards other drivers and pedestrians. Speeding is common.

Vehicles and bicycles often operate without sufficient lights and reflectors.

#### Illegal roadblocks

Illegal roadblocks are common. Heavily armed gangs have attacked travellers on intercity highways who failed to stop or pay a “toll.” Community self-defence groups and protestors have set up roadblocks and shot drivers who refused to stop or pay to cross.

Always stop at roadblocks. If you’re threatened by criminals, stay calm and do not resist.

#### Checkpoints

The military and federal police search for drugs and firearms at checkpoints throughout the country.

* Do not go through a checkpoint/roadblock without stopping, even if it appears unattended
* Follow the instructions of security forces

### Public transportation

Some public and private vehicles are poorly maintained.

#### Metro

The Mexico City metro is often very crowded and a popular place for pickpocketing. During rush hour, there are metro cars reserved for women and children at the front of the trains.

#### Buses

The Metrobus in Mexico City is generally reliable. There are sections reserved for women and children at the front of the buses.

Crime is common on some intercity buses. For intercity travel, use bus companies that offer VIP or executive class transportation and travel on toll roads.

* Do not use minibuses
* Take direct routes
* Travel only during daylight hours
* Do not carry large sums of cash
* Exercise caution at bus stations

#### Taxis

In Mexico City, all government-authorized taxis have licence plates starting with “A” or “B.” Taxis from designated stands have a company logo and licence plate number on the side of the car.

Official taxis in Mexico City are pink and white. Users can reserve these taxis on the CDMX application. Credit card fraud occurs in taxis hailed on the street, including licensed ones. Drivers may charge excessive amounts, sometimes without customers’ knowledge.

If you wish to pay by credit or debit card when taking a taxi from an airport, it is safer to book and pre-pay either inside the terminal or at the designated boarding area outside when your taxi is assigned.

* Only use officially marked taxis
* Avoid hailing taxis on the street
* Never share a taxi with strangers
* Avoid using your credit or debit card to pay inside a taxi
* Have small bills available for payment

[My taxi](https://taxi.cdmx.gob.mx/mi-taxi) – CDMX application (Spanish only)

#### Ride-sharing services

Ride-sharing services are available at some airports.

Disputes between taxi and ride-sharing service drivers may occur. Although tourists have not been targeted, you may be caught up in these incidents and be harassed or injured.

If you use a ride-sharing service:

* confirm the driver’s identity and licence plate before getting into the car
* use the security features in the ride-sharing application

### Piracy

Pirates commit attacks and armed robberies against ships in coastal waters in the Bay of Campeche. Travellers should take appropriate precautions.
