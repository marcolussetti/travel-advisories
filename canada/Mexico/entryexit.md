# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

The authorities of a country or territory decide who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Mexican authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country's entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for the expected duration of your stay in Mexico.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

You should also be aware that current systems used by some countries and travel companies may not recognize the “X” gender identifier. You may still be asked to provide your sex/gender information as either male or female when travelling.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Entering as a tourist

If you enter Mexico by air, either:

* an immigration official will stamp your passport and note the number of days you are allowed to stay in Mexico
* you may be directed to an E-gate kiosk where you will scan your passport, self-register your entry and receive a printed receipt with the number of days you are allowed to stay in Mexico

In both cases, you will need to complete a Multiple Digital Migratory Form (FMMD) online upon arrival. You should download the completed form and keep a copy with you at all times.

If you enter Mexico by land, you must complete a Multiple Immigration Form (FMM) and provide it to an immigration official, unless you stay in Mexico for less than 72 hours within the northern border zone (within 21 km of the U.S. border). The immigration official will write down in your FMM the number of days you are authorized to stay.

You can complete the FMM online before your arrival, print the form and present it to the immigration official at the port of entry, or complete it upon arrival.

Always carry your FMMD or FMM with you as proof of your legal status in Mexico. You may be asked to show it to Mexican officials:

* at an immigration checkpoint
* when departing the country

Upon departure, if you’re unable to show your FMMD or FMM or your passport with the entry stamp, you will have to pay for a replacement.

### Length of stay

The maximum stay for tourism purposes is 180 days. This maximum is not granted automatically. The immigration officer will determine the exact length of your authorized stay. If you’re seeking the maximum number of days, you may be required to:

* explain the purpose of your trip to the immigration official
* provide details about your trip (accommodations, funds, return or onward flight, etc.)
* provide a letter of invitation if staying in someone’s home

You must leave Mexico before your authorized stay ends. You won’t be able to request an extension or change the condition of your stay from inside the country.

If you overstay, you may face:

* fines
* detention
* deportation

### Migratory entry fee

Most foreign visitors must pay a migratory entry fee.

This fee is normally included in airline and cruise ship tickets. Foreign visitors arriving by land will have to pay this fee at the migration entry booth with a credit or debit card, at a bank following entry, or online prior to arrival. The receipt must be attached to your FMM for submission at departure.

You don’t have to pay this fee if you’re entering by land for tourism purposes and your stay will not exceed 7 days.

### Dual citizenship

If you enter and leave Mexico as a dual citizen, you must identify yourself as a Mexican citizen and carry valid passports for both countries.

If you are a dual citizen of Canada and Mexico, you must use your valid Canadian passport to return to Canada by air, as you are not eligible for a Special Authorization or an electronic Travel Authorization (eTA).

### Criminal record

Canadians with a criminal record or a warrant for arrest may be refused entry and returned to Canada or to a third country on the next available flight.

### Children and travel

To leave Mexico, children under 18 who are a citizen or resident of Mexico must carry one of the following:

* a Mexican Minor Travel Consent Form
* a notarized consent form if travelling without a legal guardian
