# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

The authorities of a country or territory decide who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Mexican authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for the expected duration of your stay in Mexico.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

For information on the type of visa required for these activities, contact the Mexican Embassy or the closest Mexican consulate.

### Entering as a tourist

If you enter Mexico by air:

* an immigration official will stamp your passport and note the number of days you are allowed to spend in Mexico, or
* you may be directed to an E-gate kiosk where you will scan your passport and self-register your entry. The kiosk will generate a printed reciept with the days you are allowed to spend in Mexico.

In both cases, you will have 60 days to download your multiple Digital Migratory Form (FFMD)

If you enter Mexico by land:

* you must present yourself before an immigration official and present a completed Multiple Migratory Form (FMM), unless you stay in Mexico for less than 72 hours within the northern border zone (21 km). The immigration official will write down in your FMM the number of days you are authorized to stay.

You can complete the FMM online before your arrival, print the form and present it to the immigration official at the port of entry.

Always carry with you your FMM or FMMD as proof of your legal stay in Mexico. You may be asked to show it to Mexican officials:

* at an immigration checkpoint
* when departing the country

If you are unable to show your FMM or FMMD upon departure, you will have to pay for a replacement.

### Length of stay

The maximum stay for tourism purposes is 180 days. This maximum is not granted automatically. The immigration officer will determine the exact length of your authorized stay. If you're seeking the maximum number of days, you may be required to:

* explain the purpose of your trip to the immigration official
* provide details about your trip (accommodations, funds, return flight, etc.)
* provide a letter of invitation, if staying in someone’s home

You must leave Mexico before your authorized stay ends. You won’t be able to request an extension or change the condition of your stay from inside the country.

If you overstay, you may face:

* fines
* detention
* deportation

### Tourism tax

Most visitors must pay a tourism tax.

This tax is normally included in airline ticket prices. Visitors arriving by road or sea will have to pay this tax at a bank following entry. The bank receipt must be attached to the tourist card for submission at departure.

You don't have to pay this tax if:

* you're entering by land for tourism purposes, and your stay will not exceed 7 days
* you're travelling to the northern border zone for less than 72 hours
* you're travelling to Mexico on a cruise ship

### Other entry requirements

Immigration officials may ask you to show them:

* a return or onward ticket
* proof of sufficient funds to cover your stay
* proof of accommodations

Mexico has a list of tax-exempt items you can include in your luggage. If you exceed the allowed limits, you will be required to pay an expensive tax and your items may be confiscated. Customs officials pay particular attention to electronic devices, alcohol, and cigarettes. Make sure you carefully read the list of tax-exempt items before travelling to Mexico.

### Dual citizenship

If you enter and leave Mexico as a dual citizen, you must identify yourself as a Mexican citizen and carry valid passports for both countries.

If you are a citizen of Canada and also of Mexico, you must use your Canadian passport to return to Canada by air, as you are not eligible for a Special Authorization or an electronic Travel Authorization (eTA).

### Criminal records

Canadians with a criminal record or a warrant for arrest may be refused entry and returned to Canada or to a third country on the next available flight.

### Children and travel

To leave Mexico, children under 18 who are a citizen or resident of Mexico must carry:

* a Mexican Minor Travel Consent Form; or
* a notarized consent form if travelling without a legal guardian
