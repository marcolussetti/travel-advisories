# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Mexican authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you use for travel.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for the expected duration of your stay in Mexico.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

For information on the type of visa required for these activities, contact the Mexican Embassy or the closest Mexican consulate.

### Tourist card

When you enter Mexico for a stay of less than 180 days, you are required to have a Multiple Immigration Form (FMM) or Tourist Card.

If you enter Mexico by air:

* the immigration official will stamp your passport and note the number of days you are allowed to spend in Mexico, or
* if you are a tourist, you will go through an E-gate kiosk where you will scan your passport and self-register your entry. You will receive a receipt and have 60 days to download your e-tourist card

If you enter Mexico by land:

You must present a completed tourist card unless you stay in Mexico for less than 72 hours within the northern border zone. You can complete the tourist card form online before your arrival. However, you must print the form and present it to the migration official at the port of entry. You can also obtain a tourist card at the immigration office located at the border.

If you don’t obtain a tourist card upon arrival, you may face:

* a fine
* detention
* expulsion

You should keep your tourist card with you at all times as proof of your legal stay in Mexico. You may be asked to show it to Mexican officials when exiting the country or if you are stopped at an immigration checkpoint. If you are unable to show your tourist card or digital tourist card upon departure, you will have to pay for a replacement.

### Length of stay

An immigration official will determine the number of days you can remain in Mexico and note it:

* on your tourist card if you’re entering by land
* in your passport if you’re entering by air

You may not automatically be allowed to stay in Mexico for a maximum period of 180 days. If you're seeking the maximum number of days, you may be required to:

* explain the purpose of your trip to the immigration official
* provide details about your trip (accommodations, funds, return flight, etc.)
* provide a letter of invitation, if staying in someone’s home

You won’t be able to request an extension or change the condition of your stay from inside the country.

### Tourism tax

Most visitors must pay a tourism tax.

This tax is normally included in airline ticket prices. Visitors arriving by road or sea will have to pay this tax at a bank following entry. The bank receipt must be attached to the tourist card for submission at departure.

You don't have to pay this tax if:

* you're entering by land for tourism purposes, and your stay will not exceed 7 days
* you're travelling to the northern border zone for less than 72 hours
* you're travelling to Mexico on a cruise ship

### Other entry requirements

Immigration officials may ask you to show them:

* a return or onward ticket
* proof of sufficient funds to cover your stay
* proof of accommodations

Mexico has a list of tax-exempt items you can include in your luggage. If you exceed the allowed limits, you will be required to pay an expensive tax and your items may be confiscated. Customs officials pay particular attention to electronic devices, alcohol, and cigarettes. Make sure you carefully read the list of tax-exempt items before travelling to Mexico.

### Dual citizenship

If you enter and leave Mexico as a dual citizen, you must identify yourself as a Mexican citizen and carry valid passports for both countries.

### Criminal records

Canadians with a criminal record or a warrant for arrest may be refused entry and returned to Canada or to a third country on the next available flight.

### Children and travel

* a Mexican Minor Travel Consent Form; or
* a notarized consent form if travelling without a legal guardian
