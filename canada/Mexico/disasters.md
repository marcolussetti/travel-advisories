### Climate change

Climate change is affecting Mexico. Extreme and unusual weather events are becoming more frequent and may affect your travel plans. Monitor local media for the latest information.



### Hurricane season

The hurricane season is from mid-May to the end of November in the Pacific, and from early June to the end of November in the Atlantic, Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. During this period, even small tropical storms can quickly develop into major hurricanes.

These severe storms can put you at risk and hamper the provision of essential services. You could face serious safety risks during a hurricane. You should carefully consider these risks when planning a trip during the hurricane season.

If you decide to travel to a coastal area during the hurricane season despite the risks:

* be prepared to change your travel plans on short notice, including cutting short or cancelling your trip
* stay informed of the latest regional weather forecasts
* carry emergency contact information for your airline or tour operator
* follow the advice and instructions of local authorities

### Flooding and landslides

Heavy rains can cause flooding and landslides, especially between June and November. They can hamper overland travel, especially in rural areas. Roads may become impassable and infrastructure damaged.

### Earthquakes and tsunamis

Mexico is located in an active seismic zone and there is a risk of earthquakes, aftershocks and landslides.

Earthquakes occur, particularly in Mexico City and the following states:

* Chiapas
* Guerrero
* Oaxaca

A tsunami can occur within minutes of a nearby earthquake. However, the risk of a tsunami can remain for several hours following the first tremor. If you’re staying on the coast, familiarize yourself with the region’s evacuation plans in the event of a tsunami warning.

### Forest fires

Forest fires may occur, particularly during the dry season from:

* January to June in the centre, north, northeast, south and southeast
* May to September in the northwest

The air quality in areas near active fires may deteriorate due to heavy smoke.

In case of a major fire:

* stay away from the affected area, particularly if you suffer from respiratory ailments
* monitor local media for the latest information
* follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders

### Volcanoes

Mexican authorities are closely monitoring multiple active volcanoes including:

* Colima
* Popocatepetl

Access to national parks in these areas could be restricted at any time without notice.

Eruptions could occur at any time. They sometimes lead to short-notice evacuations of surrounding areas, and ash clouds may also disrupt domestic and international flights.

Exposure to falling ash and toxic fumes from active volcanoes can affect your health.

If you are planning to travel near active volcanoes:

* consult a physician in advance to determine associated health risks if you suffer from respiratory ailments
* familiarize yourself with local emergency plans
* avoid restricted areas
* be prepared to modify your travel arrangements or even evacuate the area on short notice

In the event of a volcanic eruption:

* monitor local media for the latest information
* follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders
