## Natural disasters and climate

### Climate change

Climate change is affecting Mexico. Extreme and unusual weather events are becoming more frequent and may affect your travel plans. Monitor local media for the latest information.



### Hurricane season

The hurricane season is from mid-May to the end of November in the Pacific, and from early June to the end of November in the Atlantic, Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. During this period, even small tropical storms can quickly develop into major hurricanes.

These severe storms can put you at risk and hamper the provision of essential services. You could face serious safety risks during a hurricane. You should carefully consider these risks when planning a trip during the hurricane season.

If you decide to travel to a coastal area during the hurricane season despite the risks:

* be prepared to change your travel plans on short notice, including cutting short or cancelling your trip
* stay informed of the latest regional weather forecasts
* carry emergency contact information for your airline or tour operator
* follow the advice and instructions of local authorities

### Flooding and landslides

Heavy rains can cause flooding and landslides, especially between June and November. They can hamper overland travel, particularly in rural areas. Roads may become impassable and infrastructure damaged.

### Earthquakes and tsunamis

Mexico is located in an active seismic zone.

Earthquakes occur, particularly in Mexico City and the following states:

* Chiapas
* Guerrero
* Oaxaca

A tsunami can occur within minutes of a nearby earthquake. However, the risk of a tsunami can remain for several hours following the first tremor. If you’re staying on the coast, familiarize yourself with the region’s evacuation plans in the event of a tsunami warning.
