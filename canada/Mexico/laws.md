## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Penalties for breaking the law in Mexico can be more severe than in Canada, even for similar offences.

Foreign nationals are often held in pre-trial detention and there can be lengthy delays before a trial.

Police may detain you for up to 72 hours for many petty crimes including:

* public urination
* failure to pay a bill
* disorderly behaviour

Detention conditions are below the standards of Canadian prisons.

### Transfer to a Canadian prison

Canada and Mexico are signatories to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in Mexico to request a transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both Canadian and Mexican authorities.

This process can take a long time, and there is no guarantee that the transfer will be approved by either or both sides.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect lengthy prison sentences.

Mexican laws and their enforcement related to the possession and use of recreational and medical cannabis are unclear. You could be arrested or extorted for possession, use or transport of cannabis.

### Imports and exports

You must declare goods worth more than $500 USD.

Mexico has strict rules on the importation of weapons, vehicles, cigarettes and alcohol.

#### Weapons

Anyone entering Mexico with a firearm or ammunition without prior written authorization from Mexican authorities is subject to imprisonment.

It is illegal to enter the country with knives with blades longer than 6 cm.

#### Vehicles and boats

You must enter Mexico with the proper import permit and insurance since they cannot be obtained once you’re in Mexico.

If you fail to provide the proper documents, you could:

* face a fine
* have your vehicle or boat seized

You must present a paper document of your vehicle registration to obtain a vehicle importation permit from Mexican authorities. If you present a digital version of your vehicle registration, your vehicle may be refused entry into Mexico.

#### Cigarettes and alcohol

If you’re 18 or older, you can bring into Mexico up to:

* 20 packs of cigarettes
* 25 cigars or 200 grams of tobacco
* 3 litres of alcoholic beverages
* 6 litres of wine

If you bring more than the allowed quantities, even if you declare or hand them over to authorities, you will have to pay a hefty import tax.

#### Artifacts

It’s illegal to remove archaeological artifacts or to export such items from Mexico.

### Smoking and vaping

Smoking and vaping are prohibited in all public places except for clearly marked designated smoking areas. This includes the following places:

* beaches
* hotels
* markets
* parks
* restaurants

You may be fined or arrested if you’re caught smoking or vaping in public.

#### Electronic cigarettes

It’s illegal to bring, sell or distribute:

* electronic cigarettes
* vaping devices
* vaping solutions

Customs officials could confiscate these items if you have them in your possession upon arrival. You could also be fined or detained.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Mexico.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Mexico, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Mexico.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Mexico, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Mexico court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Mexico to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Identification

Local authorities may request to see your identification at any time, including proof of your legal status in Mexico. Always carry your original identification.

### Identity documents

The names on your identification must match those on your birth certificate to obtain official Mexican documents, including:

* a marriage certificate
* immigration documents

Middle names are often not included in Canadian identity documents. This has caused significant difficulties for many Canadians planning to move to Mexico or dealing with the Mexican Civil Registry. Obtain a Canadian passport that will meet Mexican requirements before applying for residency in Mexico.

### Investments

Mexican real estate agents are not licensed or regulated. Disputes related to property acquisition or other investments are costly and take time to resolve.

If you plan to buy property or make other investments in Mexico:

* seek legal advice in Canada and in Mexico before making commitments
* choose your own lawyer
* avoid hiring a lawyer recommended by a seller

### Rental accommodations

In Mexico, rental agreements between two individuals are considered a private matter and are not regulated by the government.

If you encounter difficulties with a rental agreement, you must consult a local lawyer.

### Driving

You should carry an International Driving Permit.

#### Automobile insurance

Mexican liability insurance is mandatory. Canadian automobile insurance is not valid in Mexico.

You can obtain insurance at the Mexican border. You should obtain full coverage, including for legal assistance.

#### Accidents

If you’re involved in a traffic accident, you may face serious legal problems, including imprisonment. If you don’t have Mexican liability insurance, you could be prevented from leaving the country until all parties agree that adequate financial satisfaction has been received. If you’re found to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of an accident, or if you don’t have a valid driver’s licence, your automobile insurance will be considered invalid.

You could be taken into custody and have your vehicle seized until responsibility for the accident is determined and all fines are paid. You must report any accident you’re involved in to the police.

Criminals may deliberately cause collisions and threaten violence in order to make insurance claims or request cash from the other party.

#### Driving restrictions in Mexico City

To reduce air pollution, the Hoy No Circula (No Driving Today) program restricts some cars from driving in Mexico City.

This program is strictly enforced. You may face heavy fines and temporary confiscation of your vehicle if you don’t comply. Generally, electric and hybrid cars are exempted from these restrictions. Consult the Hoy No Circula calendar before driving.

### Buying or selling a vehicle

You can only buy a car in Mexico if you’re a temporary or permanent resident.

Selling your imported vehicle is illegal in Mexico and is subject to penalties including:

* fines
* car seizure
* deportation

### Money

The currency of Mexico is the Mexican peso (MXN).

You must declare upon arrival and departure if you carry more than $10,000 USD or equivalent in other currencies. This includes:

* cash
* cheques
* money orders

* any other receivable document

If you fail to make this declaration, you could be detained.

There is a limit to the amount of U.S. dollars that residents and foreigners can exchange in Mexico, depending on immigration status. The rule doesn’t apply to Canadian dollars, but some financial institutions, hotels and currency exchange bureaus don’t make the distinction.
