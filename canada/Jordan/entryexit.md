# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Jordanian authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you use for travel.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond the date you expect to leave Jordan.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Visas

#### Tourist visa

Required, and valid for 30 days. You may obtain a visa upon arrival if you travel by air or enter Jordan at the following border crossings:

* Sheikh Hussein Bridge
* Wadi Araba (Aqaba)

Due to recent events in Israel, West Bank and the Gaza Strip, operations at the land borders with Jordan may be affected by reduced hours or closure on short notice.

You need to obtain a visa online or from a Jordanian diplomatic mission prior to travelling if you’re planning on entering Jordan at the King Hussein Bridge (Allenby) border crossing.

You can extend the validity of a visitor visa at any police station.

If you overstay your visa, you’ll be fined when leaving the country.

#### Business visa

First, you need a tourism visa to enter. Then, you must obtain a residency permit from Jordan’s Ministry of Interior upon arrival.

#### Residency Permit

You must obtain a tourist visa to enter Jordan. Once in Jordan, you may apply for a residency permit from the Ministry of Interior.

Jordan only issues visas at:

* international airports
* the Sheikh Hussein Bridge border crossing
* the Wadi Araba (Aqaba) border crossing

Jordan doesn’t issue visas at the King Hussein Bridge (Allenby) border crossing between Jordan and the West Bank.

### Health entry requirements

You must take a medical exam to obtain a residency permit, including mandatory testing for tuberculosis, HIV and hepatitis C.

### Other entry requirements

Canadians who were previously in Jordan under a Refugee Status Determination process may be subject to different entry requirements and should contact the nearest Jordanian Embassy before travel.

### Registration

Register with the police for stays of more than 2 weeks.

### Travelling to neighbouring countries

If travelling from Jordan to neighbouring countries, ensure that you obtain your visas before departing Canada. These countries don’t normally issue visas at border crossings to individuals without a Jordanian residency permit.

#### Travelling to and from Israel

Consult our travel advice for Israel, the West Bank and Gaza Strip for more information on entry requirements.

If you’re travelling beyond Jordan, note that other countries have denied Canadians entry because their passports bore a Jordanian border stamp issued by an office bordering Israel. Such a stamp would indicate that the traveller had entered Jordan from Israel.

#### Travelling from Egypt

You’ll need to show your Egyptian entry and exit stamps to border officials when arriving from Egypt.

### Customs

Upon departure, your luggage may be searched for security reasons and to prevent the illegal export of Jordanian and Iraqi antiquities.
