# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

The authorities of a country or territory decide who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Jordanian authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country's entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond the date you expect to leave Jordan.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

You should also be aware that current systems used by some countries and travel companies may not recognize the “X” gender identifier. You may still be asked to provide your sex/gender information as either male or female when travelling.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Visas

Tourist visa: required and valid for 3 months  
 Transit visa: required and valid for 3 days  
 Visitor visa: required  
 Work visa: required  
 Student visa: required

You can apply for a tourist visa in advance through the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities or a travel company. These visas are often linked to the Jordan Pass for tourists, which includes entry to various tourist sites and waives visa fees with a minimum stay.

You can obtain a visitor or transit visa upon arrival.

Jordan only issues visas on arrival at:

* international airports
* the Sheikh Hussein Bridge border crossing
* the Wadi Araba (Aqaba) border crossing

Jordan doesn’t issue visas at the King Hussein Bridge (Allenby) border crossing between Jordan and the West Bank.

You need to obtain a visa online or from a Jordanian diplomatic mission prior to travelling if you’re planning on entering Jordan at the King Hussein Bridge (Allenby) border crossing.

You can extend the validity of your visa at any police station. For work visas and student visas, different procedures may apply.

If you overstay your visa, you’ll be fined when leaving the country.

### Registration

If you plan to stay in Jordan for more than 14 days, including if you’re travelling on a visitor visa, you must file a formal registration request.

Requests can be submitted to the Public Security Directorate, one of its branches or a local police station within 13 days of the date you enter Jordan. Any police station can provide information on the required documents. You should plan enough time to complete the registration process, which can take several hours.

This requirement does not apply to:

* tourist visa holders during the first 30 days
* transit visa holders
* Hajj visa holders

If you’re travelling on a tourist, transit or Hajj visa and would like to stay longer than the permitted duration, you must, before the end of this period:

* submit an extension request
* register if travelling on a tourist visa
* register if travelling on a transit or Hajj visa and staying more than 14 days in total

If you fail to register, you will be fined upon departure.

### Health entry requirements

You must take a medical exam to obtain a residency permit, including mandatory testing for tuberculosis, HIV and hepatitis C.

### Other entry requirements

Canadians who were previously in Jordan under a Refugee Status Determination process may be subject to different entry requirements and should contact the nearest Jordanian embassy before travel.

### Travelling to neighbouring countries

If travelling from Jordan to neighbouring countries, ensure that you obtain your visas before departing Canada. These countries don’t normally issue visas at border crossings to individuals without a Jordanian residency permit.

### Travelling to and from Israel and Palestine

Consult our travel advice for [Israel and Palestine](https://travel.gc.ca/destinations/israel-and-palestine) for more information on entry requirements.

If you’re travelling beyond Jordan, note that other countries have denied Canadians entry because their passports bore a Jordanian border stamp issued by an office bordering Israel. Such a stamp would indicate that the traveller had entered Jordan from Israel.

### Travelling from Egypt

You’ll need to show your Egyptian entry and exit stamps to border officials when arriving from Egypt.

### Customs

Upon departure, your luggage may be searched for security reasons and to prevent the illegal export of Jordanian and Iraqi antiquities.
