## Natural disasters and climate

Jordan is located in an active seismic zone. Strong aftershocks may occur up to one week after the initial earthquake. Landslides are possible in certain areas.

Droughts and sand and dust storms occur.

Snowfall is infrequent but can cause extensive road closures and disrupt public services.

### Rainy season

The rainy season usually extends from November to March.

Heavy rain can result in flash floods in dry river beds and canyons (or “wadis”).  
Flash floods and landslides can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable and bridges damaged.

• Monitor local news and weather reports  
• Stay away from the affected areas  
• Follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders
