## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Legal process

Jordan’s legal process is different from Canada’s. You are subject to all local laws, penalties and timelines. Police may hold suspects and witnesses to incidents for lengthy periods without access to legal counsel or consular officials.

### Administration

Jordan offers government services in Arabic only. Before submitting official documents to local authorities, you must have them translated into Arabic.

The work week is from Sunday to Thursday.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Jordan.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Jordan, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### Family law

#### Children

Before travelling to Jordan, and in case of a family dispute involving children, both parents should ensure they’re fully aware of the implications of local laws on children’s mobility, access and custody.

Any adult male may prevent related minor children from leaving Jordan by placing a travel hold with Jordanian authorities.

Immigration officials may prevent children travelling with their mothers from departing Jordan without their father’s consent. This is possible even if the child or mother is solely a Canadian citizen. Jordanian authorities consider disputes surrounding travel holds as private family matters. The Embassy of Canada is limited in its ability to intervene. Only a court or the person who requested the travel hold may remove it.

#### Spouses

Under Jordanian law, a husband may place a travel hold on his wife, preventing her departure from Jordan.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Jordan.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Jordan by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Jordan to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Even possession or use of small amounts of illegal drugs is a criminal offence. If you’re accused of a drug offence, you could be detained for up to 2 weeks without being charged. Convicted offenders can expect heavy jail sentences and fines.

### Alcohol

Consumption of alcohol outside approved venues is illegal. It could result in your arrest, heavy fines or imprisonment. Public intoxication is a criminal offence, whether or not consumption occurred privately.

### Identification

Local authorities may request to see your identification at any time. Always carry valid identification or a photocopy of it.

### Illegal activities

Other illegal activities include:

* insulting King Abdullah II or other members of Jordan’s royal family
* photographing government buildings and military installations
* all forms of religious proselytizing, including distribution of religious materials
* adultery and extramarital sexual relations
* prostitution
* possession of pornographic material

### Driving

By law, all vehicles must carry a fire extinguisher and warning triangle.

#### Accidents

If a pedestrian is injured in an accident, authorities always deem the driver to be guilty. As the driver, you may face imprisonment and heavy fines.

Many drivers involved in an accident may avoid calling the police and try to negotiate a settlement instead. However, they may later try to file a claim against you.

In the event of an accident causing personal injury, the driver may be held for several days until responsibility and appropriate restitution is determined.

To avoid legal issues, call the police to attend the scene of the accident and assess responsibility.

#### Drinking and driving

Jordan has a zero-tolerance policy for drinking and driving. If a police officer suspects you of drinking and driving, they could confiscate your driver’s licence on the spot. If you’re convicted, you can expect heavy fines and possible imprisonment.

#### International driving permit

You should carry an international driving permit. If you have a valid Canadian driver’s licence or an international driving permit, you may only drive rental cars. To drive any other vehicle, you must hold a Jordanian driver’s licence.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Although Jordanian law does not prohibit sexual acts between individuals of the same sex, homosexuality is not socially tolerated. Jordan does not recognize same-sex marriages.

Members of the 2SLGBTQI+ community could face arrest under other charges, such as anti-adultery or public indecency laws.

2SLGBTQI+ travellers should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Jordan.

### Dress and behaviour

Jordan’s customs, laws and regulations adhere closely to Islamic practices and beliefs.

To avoid offending local sensitivities:

* dress conservatively
* behave discreetly
* respect religious and social traditions
* seek permission from locals before photographing them
* avoid public displays of affection, including holding hands

In 2026, the lunar month of Ramadan is expected to begin on or around February 17.

In public, between sunrise and sunset, refrain from:

* drinking
* eating
* smoking

### Money

The currency of Jordan is the Jordanian dinar (JOD). ATMs are available in larger cities and at the Queen Alia International Airport but are limited elsewhere. Only U.S. dollars and euros are easily convertible into local currency.

Larger stores and restaurants in Amman and other tourist areas accept credit cards.
