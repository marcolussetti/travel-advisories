## Safety and security

### Tensions in the Middle East

The security situation remains unpredictable and could deteriorate significantly with little or no warning.

This may result in travel disruptions, including flight cancellations and airspace closures.

You should:

* monitor local and international media to stay informed of the rapidly evolving situation
* be vigilant and follow the instructions of local authorities at all times
* Register or update your contact information with the [Registration of Canadians Abroad](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/registration "https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/registration") service to receive the latest information from the Government of Canada

### Areas within 5 km of the borders with Syria and Iraq, with the exception of the tourist site Umm Qais

Clashes involving small arms and mortar fire have occurred in the areas bordering Syria and Iraq, due to the ongoing conflict in these countries. Borders with Syria and Iraq are highly militarized. Government security forces may engage vehicles and people coming into Jordan illegally.

### Refugee camps

You must receive the Government of Jordan’s approval for travel to the Syrian refugee camps of Zaatari and Azraq. Some refugee camps are located close to urban centres and are not always visibly demarcated. You should exercise caution and be aware of your surroundings at all times to avoid inadvertently entering a camp.

### Terrorism

There’s a threat of terrorism. Transnational and domestic terrorist groups have demonstrated the capability to plan and implement attacks in Jordan. Terrorist attacks could occur at any time.

Jordanian security forces have increased their operations across the country. This has resulted in the deaths of suspected terrorists, bystanders and local security officers. Further counterterrorism operations are expected throughout Jordan. Heightened security measures are in place.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including police stations
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations occur regularly. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

Protests related to the ongoing conflicts in Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip are taking place periodically at various locations across Jordan.

Major gathering places have included:

* places of worship, especially:

+ the Al Husseini Mosque in downtown Amman
+ the Al Kalouti mosque near the Israeli embassy in Rabieh, Amman

* refugee camps, including:

+ the al-Wehdat refugee camp in South Amman
+ the Baqa'a refugee camp near Ein Al-Basha on the Amman-Jerash highway

* various neighbourhoods in East Amman

Most protests have been peaceful and contained by security forces. Isolated incidents of clashes with security forces have been reported.

Future protests near border areas could result in confrontations between security forces and demonstrators. They could lead to temporary closures of the Dead Sea highway and surrounding roads.

Jordanian authorities may employ enhanced measures to respond to demonstrations, including:

* deploying additional security forces
* using crowd dispersal methods
* establishing checkpoints and roadblocks

Protests may occur at various locations across the country.

#### In Amman

Demonstrations have occurred in Amman at locations including:

* the Al Husseini Mosque, downtown;
* in front of Parliament in Abdali District;
* in front of the Prime Ministry at 4th circle on Zahran Street.

#### Outside of Amman

Other cities in Jordan where large demonstrations occur frequently include Irbid, Kerak, Ma’an, Madaba, Mafraq, Salt and Zarqa.

### Crime

#### Petty Crime

The crime rate is low by regional standards. Petty crime occurs, especially at tourist sites and in crowded areas. Theft of vehicles, assaults, robberies and attempted residential break-ins also occur.

* Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Always carry a photocopy of identification documents for identification purposes
* Don’t display valuables in your car or on your person
* Lock car doors and windows
* Avoid travelling alone, especially in remote areas

### Adulterated alcohol

People have died in Jordan after drinking methanol-adulterated alcohol. Poisoning incidents have happened at various locations, including in Amman, Zarqa and Balqa.

You should be alert to the risk of poisoning when buying and/or consuming lesser-known alcohol brands. Even if the wrapping or container appears intact, it may contain substances that could put your health at risk.

* Be cautious if you choose to drink alcohol
* Avoid buying alcohol from individuals
* Seek medical assistance if you begin to feel sick

### Firearms

Incidents of celebratory gunfire, while illegal, are common and occasionally result in injury and death.

### Tribal violence

Clashes between tribes, clans or families periodically erupt and sometimes involve the use of firearms. Response from authorities is often delayed or non-existent.

### Women’s safety

Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse.

Sexual harassment and assaults have occurred.

Women have been detained when reporting a sexual assault. Women must prove that any sexual activity was not consensual to avoid being charged under extramarital sex statutes.

Women should:

* dress conservatively
* travel in groups
* travel during daylight hours
* sit in the back seat of taxis.

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety can vary greatly throughout the country. Driving conditions may be hazardous during winter. Accidents are common but more frequent during Ramadan and Eid.

Some drivers don’t respect traffic laws. Drivers may be aggressive and drive very close to each other. It’s typical for drivers not to use signals to indicate turns or lane changes. Drivers often talk or text on mobile phones while driving, although this is illegal in Jordan.

Off-road driving can be hazardous, and you should only do it in a convoy of four-wheel-drive vehicles with an experienced guide.

* Avoid driving at night in rural areas, as roaming animals and insufficient lighting create hazards after dark
* Leave your travel itinerary with a family member or friend
* Be well prepared and equipped with gasoline, water, food and a cellular phone

#### If you’re involved in an accident

Many drivers involved in an accident may avoid calling the police and try to negotiate a settlement instead. However, they may later try to file a claim against you.

In the event of an accident causing personal injury, the driver may be held for several days until responsibility and appropriate restitution is determined.

To avoid legal issues, call the police to attend the scene of the accident and assess responsibility.

### Public transportation

Public transportation is usually very crowded. It can be uncomfortable.

### Taxis

The cleanliness and mechanical reliability of taxis vary considerably. Book taxis through hotels.

Vehicles booked through ride-hailing applications are generally more reliable and in better condition than taxis in Jordan.

### Air travel

We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.
