# Safety and security

## Safety and security

Due to the ongoing security situation in Israel and Palestine, operations at land borders may be affected by reduced hours or closure on short notice.

Verify the status of border crossings ahead of time.

### Tensions in the Middle East

Tensions can flare up suddenly in the Middle East, and lead to travel disruptions, including flight cancellations and airspace closures.

### Areas within 5 km of the borders with Iraq and Syria, except the tourist site Umm Qais

Clashes involving small arms and mortar fire have occurred in the areas bordering Iraq and Syria. Borders with Iraq and Syria are highly militarized. Government security forces may engage vehicles and people coming into Jordan illegally.

### Refugee camps

You must receive the Government of Jordan’s approval for travel to the Syrian refugee camps of Zaatari and Azraq. Some refugee camps are located close to urban centres and are not always visibly demarcated. You should exercise caution and be aware of your surroundings at all times to avoid inadvertently entering a camp.

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism. Transnational and domestic terrorist groups have planned and carried out attacks in Jordan. Terrorist attacks could occur at any time.

Jordanian security forces have increased their operations across the country. This has resulted in the arrest or death of suspected terrorists, bystanders and local security officers. Further counterterrorism operations are expected throughout Jordan. Heightened security measures are in place.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including police stations
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations occur regularly, often on Friday afternoons. They take place at various locations across Jordan.

Major gathering places have included:

* places of worship
* refugee camps, including:
  + the al-Wehdat refugee camp in South Amman
  + the Baqa’a refugee camp near Ein Al-Basha on the Amman-Jerash highway
* in Amman:
  + various neighbourhoods in East Amman
  + the Al Kalouti mosque near the Israeli Embassy in Rabieh
  + in front of the Prime Ministry at 4th Circle on Zahran Street
  + the Al Husseini mosque downtown
  + in front of Parliament in Abdali District

Other cities in Jordan where large demonstrations may occur include:

* Irbid
* Karak
* Ma’an
* Madaba
* Mafraq
* Salt
* Zarqa

Most protests have been peaceful and contained by security forces. However, even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

Isolated incidents of clashes with security forces have been reported.

Jordanian authorities may employ enhanced measures to respond to demonstrations, including:

* deploying additional security forces
* using crowd dispersal methods
* establishing checkpoints and roadblocks

During your trip:

* avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* follow the instructions of local authorities
* monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Crime

#### Petty crime

The crime rate is low by regional standards. Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and bag snatching, occurs, especially at tourist sites and in crowded areas. Assaults, robberies and burglaries also occur.

During your trip:

* keep your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, in a secure place
* do not show signs of affluence or wear expensive jewellery
* always keep car doors and windows closed and locked
* avoid travelling alone, especially in remote areas

### Adulterated alcohol

Several people died in Jordan in June 2025 after drinking methanol-adulterated alcohol.

While the incident was contained, you should remain alert to the risk of poisoning when buying and/or consuming lesser-known alcohol brands. Even if the wrapping or container appears intact, it may contain substances that could put your health at risk.

* Be cautious if you choose to drink alcohol
* Avoid buying alcohol from individuals
* Seek medical assistance if you begin to feel sick

### Firearms

Celebratory gunfire, while illegal, occurs and occasionally results in injury and death.

### Women’s safety

Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse.

Sexual harassment and assaults have occurred.

If you’re the victim of a sexual assault, you should report it immediately to the nearest Government of Canada office.

Women should:

* dress conservatively
* travel in groups
* travel during daylight hours
* sit in the back seat of taxis

### Roads

Road conditions and road safety can vary greatly throughout the country. Driving conditions may be hazardous during the winter.

Some drivers don’t respect traffic laws and can be aggressive and reckless. They often talk or text on mobile phones while driving, although this is illegal in Jordan.

Off-road driving can be hazardous. You should only do it in a convoy of four-wheel-drive vehicles with an experienced guide.

Driving can also be dangerous due to:

* insufficient lighting
* stray livestock

If you choose to drive in Jordan:

* avoid travelling after dark
* inform a friend or family member of your itinerary
* fill your gas tank before you travel, especially if you are travelling to a remote area

### Public transportation

#### Buses

Due to overcrowding and inconsistent maintenance, you should avoid using smaller-style “coaster” buses.

#### Taxis and ride-sharing services

The cleanliness and mechanical reliability of taxis vary considerably.

Licensed taxis have a government-issued sticker on the windshield.

Vehicles booked through ride-sharing applications are generally more reliable and in better condition than taxis.

* Only use officially marked taxis
* Ask for your taxi at the front desk if you’re using hotel services
* Avoid hailing taxis on the street
