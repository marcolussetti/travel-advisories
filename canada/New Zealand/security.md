# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs, especially in major cities. Theft generally occurs in the following places:

* hotel rooms
* tourist sites
* recreational areas
* unattended vehicles

Make sure that your belongings, including your passport, are secure at all times.

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism. Far-right domestic terrorists have carried out attacks in New Zealand, the most recent being the 2019 shootings in Christchurch at two mosques.

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places. Terrorist attacks could occur at any time. Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

The Government of New Zealand maintains a public alert system on terrorism and communicates threat level changes online and through social media.

### Fraud

There is credit card and ATM fraud.

When using debit or credit cards:

* pay careful attention if other people are handling your cards
* use ATMs located in public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations may occur. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Adventure tourism

Adventure tourism, such as zip-lining, rock climbing or trekking, can be dangerous, especially if they are not well-organized. Trails are not always marked and weather conditions can change rapidly, even in summer.

Serious accidents have occurred in New Zealand and some activity operators have been accused of negligence.

Tour operators may not meet international standards.

If you are participating in adventure tourism, such as zip-lining, rock climbing, trekking, hiking, parasailing:

* obtain detailed information on the activity before setting out
* never do so alone and always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company
* make sure your travel insurance covers the recreational activities you choose
* make sure your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* make sure you’re well-equipped and informed about weather and other hazardous conditions
* consider purchasing or renting a distress or personal locator beacon (PLB)
* tell a family member or friend about your itinerary, including when you expect to be back
* know the symptoms of acute altitude sickness, which can be fatal
* don’t venture off marked trails
* don’t use the facilities or equipment if you have doubts about their safety

### Remote areas

Some regions in New Zealand are very isolated and have small populations. Services may be scarce.

You may have difficulty getting adequate mobile phone coverage if you travel in a remote area by car.

* Avoid travelling alone
* Inform relatives of your itinerary
* Check with local authorities before travelling if alerts have been issued for your destination

### Water activities

#### Swimming

Coastal waters can be dangerous. Riptides are common and can be dangerous. Several drownings occur each year.

In certain areas, sharks, seals and other wildlife pose a risk to swimmers.

* Avoid unsupervised beaches
* Follow the instructions and warnings of lifeguards
* Respect the flag warning system, which provides notice of water conditions and safety risks on beaches

#### Diving and snorkelling

Ensure that your aquatic equipment is safe and in good condition.

Never dive alone. Choose excursions with experienced tour operators.

### Road travel

Road conditions and road safety are very good throughout the country.

#### Road conditions

Roads can be narrow, curvy and cover hilly terrain. Mountain roads, including those leading to ski hills, may be unpaved and without safety barriers.

Weather conditions can change quickly, particularly during winter. Snow, ice, fog, rain and strong winds can lead to dangerous driving conditions.

Landslides caused by heavy rain can block or wash away roads.

#### Road safety

Railway crossings may not have barriers, and bells may ring only during daylight hours, especially in rural areas.  Drinking and driving is common. Many road fatalities involve alcohol or drug use. Drivers often drive at excessive speeds.

Roaming animals in rural areas may pose further hazard. Dairy herds often cross main roads at milking time.

Pedestrians should use caution when crossing streets and be mindful that traffic is coming from the opposite direction than what they may be used to.
