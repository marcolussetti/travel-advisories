### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and New Zealand.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in New Zealand, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the New Zealand court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in New Zealand to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Driving

Traffic drives on the left-hand side of the road.

You can drive in New Zealand with your Canadian driver license for up to 12 months. If you plan to stay for more than 12 months, you’ll need to get a New Zealand driver licence.

You should carry an international driving permit.

New Zealand’s Accident Compensation Act covers you for personal injuries if involved in an accident. However, the Act bars you from suing for losses stemming from personal injury resulting from the accident.
