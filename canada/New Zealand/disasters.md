### Seismic activity

New Zealand is located in an active seismic zone. Earthquakes and tsunamis occur. A tsunami can occur within minutes of a nearby earthquake. However, the risk of tsunami can remain for several hours following the first tremor. It can travel long distances across the Pacific.

If you’re staying on the coast, familiarize yourself with the region’s evacuation plans in the event of a tsunami warning.

#### Volcanoes

New Zealand has six Volcanic Alert Levels, ranging from no volcanic unrest, through two levels of volcanic unrest, to three levels of volcanic eruption. Currently Mount Ruapehu in Tongariro National Park is at alert level 2 due to high levels of volcanic gas emissions and steam plumes. There are a number of volcanoes and active thermal areas in the country, consider the risk before you go.

In the event of a volcanic eruption:

* stay indoors to reduce your exposure to ash
* keep windows and doors closed to prevent ash from entering
* use a face mask when outdoors for respiratory protection
* wear protective clothing if you need to be outdoors for extended periods
* monitor local media
* follow the instructions of local authorities
