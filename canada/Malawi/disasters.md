## Natural disasters and climate

### Earthquakes

Malawi is located in a seismic zone. Although infrequent, earthquakes do occasionally occur and may cause landslides. Strong aftershocks are possible up to one week after the initial quake.

### Rainy season

The rainy season extends from November to April.

Seasonal flooding can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services. Secondary roads may become impassable due to mudslides and landslides. Bridges, buildings, and infrastructure may be damaged.
