# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and bag snatching occurs regularly.

Theft is frequent in:

* popular tourist areas including marketplaces and high-density residential areas
* main bus stations, especially in Lilongwe and Blantyre
* the ferry terminals for the Ilhla ferry
* restaurants, including patios located near streets
* hotels

During your stay in Malawi:

* ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and your other travel documents are secure at all times
* avoid carrying large sums of cash or unnecessary valuables
* avoid walking at night, either alone or with a group
* pay attention to your surroundings, particularly in crowded and tourist areas

#### Violent crime

Violent crime occurs, especially in Lilongwe and Blantyre. Incidents include:

* carjacking
* residential burglary
* armed robbery
* assault

There are further reports of travellers being targeted in the Mulanje district and facing intimidation and violence.

During your trip:

* always be aware of your surroundings
* always keep your car windows up and doors locked
* be vigilant if approached by strangers befriending you, offering assistance or to become your tour guide
* if you're robbed, hand over cash, electronic devices and valuables without resistance

### Road safety

Road safety is poor throughout the country. Fatal vehicle accident rates are high, partly due to the lack of emergency health care availability.

Police rarely conduct road patrols. Hitchhiking and taking matola (informal lifts in the back of open vehicles) are considered dangerous.

#### Road conditions

Road conditions vary throughout the country. Highways are generally in good condition, but most roads don’t have road shoulders, leaving pedestrians, cyclists, and livestock to use roadways day and night.

Driving can also be dangerous due to:

* insufficient lighting
* potholes
* unpaved roads
* poorly maintained and abandoned vehicles

#### Driving habits

Drivers don’t always respect traffic laws and have poor driving skills.

Drinking and driving and cell phone use while driving are common.

Roadside assistance is very limited.

If you choose to drive in Malawi:

* always drive defensively
* avoid driving at night
* plan your trip in advance, especially if you are visiting a rural area
* don't pick up hitchhikers
* ask about insurance coverage options for roadside assistance when you rent a vehicle

#### Roadblocks

Roadblocks are common throughout the country.

You may be asked for identification.

* Make sure your ID documents are up to date
* Do not go through a checkpoint without stopping, even if it appears unattended
* If stopped, follow the instructions of police officers

### Demonstrations

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Fuel shortages

Fuel shortages occur frequently. This could lead to line-ups and gas stations and a reduction of essential services.

* Plan accordingly
* Keep a supply of fuel on hand

### Tourist infrastructure

Tourist infrastructure is limited outside of major centres.

If you’re planning to travel to remote areas:

* plan your trip accordingly
* keep a supply of water, food and fuel on hand
* make sure you always have a complete emergency kit on hand
* bring a cell phone, charger and local emergency numbers
* use a reputable tour operator

### Adventure tourism

Outdoor activities, such as kayaking, scuba diving, snorkelling, hiking, mountain biking, etc. and other adventure activities can be dangerous if unprepared. Trails are not always marked, and weather conditions can change rapidly, even during summer.

Tour operators may not always adhere to international safety standards.

If you intend to practice adventure tourism:

* never do so alone, and do not part with your tour companions
* contact the Mountain Club of Malawi for security advice before climbing Mount Mulanje
* obtain detailed information on your activity and on the environment in which you will be setting out
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to tackle the challenges of your activity
* ensure that you’re adequately equipped and bring sufficient water

### Wildlife viewing

Wildlife viewing poses risks, particularly on foot or at close range.

* Only use reputable and professional guides or tour operators
* Always maintain a safe distance when observing wildlife
* Only exit a vehicle when a professional guide or warden says it’s safe to do so
* Closely follow park regulations and warden’s advice

### Spiked food and drinks

Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

### Women’s Safety

Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse.

### Public transportation

Long-distance buses between big cities are generally safe but some operate with standing passengers. Public transport is limited in rural areas. Travel by minibus is not recommended, as the vehicles are overcrowded and poorly maintained.

Some ferries operating on Lake Malawi have poor safety measures. Don’t board a ferry that appears overloaded or unseaworthy.

### Air travel

We don't make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.
