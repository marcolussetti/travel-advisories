## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Jamaican law prohibits sexual acts between individuals of the same sex. Other related offences include being in a same-sex marriage and the "promotion of homosexuality." Those convicted can face sentences of up to 10 years in prison, though authorities rarely enforce the law.

2SLGBTQI+ persons could be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression or sex characteristics.

Though violence against 2SLGBTQI+ persons and their allies has declined significantly over the past decade, 2SLGBTQI+ travellers should:

* carefully consider the risks of travelling to Jamaica
* be cautious and avoid public displays of affection with someone of the same sex

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect lengthy prison sentences.

Departing visitors are thoroughly screened for drug possession. Many Canadians are serving prison sentences for drug crimes, in some cases committed unwittingly. When leaving Ocho Rios and Montego Bay by cruise ship, you may be searched for drugs by local authorities. You should have a witness accompany you if you undergo such procedures.

* Pack all luggage yourself
* Don’t carry anything through customs for anyone else

#### Cannabis

Jamaica decriminalized the possession of up to two ounces of cannabis, which will be punishable by a fine and will not result in a criminal record. Smoking cannabis in public places, however, remains prohibited. Jamaican authorities continue to enforce strict laws against the possession and trafficking of narcotics, in accordance with international agreements to combat drug trafficking.

Don’t attempt to depart Jamaica and cross international borders with any amount of cannabis.

### Illegal activities

It’s illegal to:

* wear, buy or sell army or police camouflage clothing
* nudist bathing in non-designated areas
* use of indecent language

### Imports and exports

There are strict import and export regulations on:

* fruits and vegetables
* animals, including pets
* animal products
* firearms

Entering the country with a firearm or even a single round of ammunition is considered a serious crime.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Jamaica.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Jamaica, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Jamaica.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Jamaica by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Jamaica to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Driving

Traffic drives on the left.

You can drive in Jamaica with a valid Canadian driver’s licence for up to six months. After 6 months, you must obtain a Jamaican driver’s licence.

It is mandatory to wear a helmet on mopeds, motor scooters and motorcycles, and to wear a seatbelt in cars and taxis. There are heavy fines for non-compliance.

You should carry an international driving permit.

### Investments

If you plan on buying property or making other investments in Jamaica, seek legal advice in Canada and in Jamaica. Do so before making commitments. Related disputes could take time and be costly to resolve.

### Money

The currency of Jamaica is the Jamaican dollar (JMD).

Hotels and businesses catering to tourists accept major credit cards.

There is limited ATM availability outside Kingston and Montego Bay. Make sure you have enough cash to cover your expenses if travelling outside these areas.
