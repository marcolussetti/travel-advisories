### Hurricane season

The hurricane season is from early June to the end of November in the Atlantic, Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. During this period, even small tropical storms can quickly develop into major hurricanes.

These severe storms can put you at risk and hamper the provision of essential services. You could face serious safety risks during a hurricane. You should carefully consider these risks when planning a trip during the hurricane season.

If you decide to travel to a coastal area during the hurricane season despite the risks:

* be prepared to change your travel plans on short notice, including cutting short or cancelling your trip
* stay informed of the latest regional weather forecasts
* carry emergency contact information for your airline or tour operator
* follow the advice and instructions of local authorities

### Earthquakes and tsunamis

Jamaica is located in an active seismic zone. It is subject to earthquakes and is at risk of tsunamis.

A tsunami can occur within minutes of a nearby earthquake. However, the risk of tsunami can remain for several hours following the first tremor. If you’re staying on the coast, familiarize yourself with the region’s evacuation plans in the event of a tsunami warning.

In the event of an earthquake:

* monitor local media for the latest information
* follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders
