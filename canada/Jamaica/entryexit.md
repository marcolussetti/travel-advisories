# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

The authorities of a country or territory decide who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Jamaican authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country's entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for the expected duration of your stay in Jamaica.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

You should also be aware that current systems used by some countries and travel companies may not recognize the “X” gender identifier. You may still be asked to provide your sex/gender information as either male or female when travelling.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

### Visas

Tourist visa: not required  
Work visa: not required  
Business visa: not required   
Student visa: not required

Immigration officers will generally grant visitors to Jamaica visitor landed status for 90 days. You must seek an extension if you are planning to stay up to an additional 90 days. You may request an extension at any immigration office. For stays beyond 90 days, you will require a visa.

Overstaying a visa or entry stamp is a criminal offence and can lead to prison time, heavy fines and deportation.

Persons found working illegally may be held in a local prison until arrangements for their return to Canada are made at their own cost.

### Other entry requirements

Customs officials may ask you to show them a return or onward ticket and proof of sufficient funds to cover your stay.

You must provide certain information to immigration officials. You can do this online before arriving in Jamaica, or complete and sign a Jamaican immigration landing card, usually given to travellers upon arrival at the airport or during the flight. If you complete the immigration landing card:

* present it to an immigration official at the airport
* retain the card and present it to immigration officials upon departure from Jamaica
