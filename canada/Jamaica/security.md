## Safety and security

### Crime

#### Violent crime

Violent crime, including armed robbery and murder, has decreased in recent years but is still an issue in large cities, including parts of Kingston and Montego Bay.

Police are present in locations popular with tourists, including resorts. Although violent crime rates are lower in these areas, incidents of assault and robbery occur.

Crime tends to be concentrated within what the police refer to as “traditional hot spots” or “high-risk communities”. The availability of firearms is widespread, and most violent drug- and gang-related crimes, especially murder, involve firearms.

Certain urban areas of Kingston, Montego Bay, St. Catherine, and the town of May Pen have a significant gang population and high incidences of violent crime.

If you decide to travel to higher-risk areas:

* maintain a high level of personal security awareness at all times
* avoid visiting or travelling at night
* follow the advice of local authorities
* avoid walking alone, even during the day
* go out in groups with people that you know
* avoid visiting isolated areas and beaches

If you’re threatened by robbers, don’t resist, and hand over your cash and valuables. Resistance may provoke the use of violence.

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and bag snatching, occurs in major tourist areas and crowded places.

* Keep your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, in a secure place
* Do not carry large sums of cash or valuables unnecessarily
* Do not show signs of wealth or wear expensive jewellery
* Use ATMs located in public areas or inside a bank or business
* Protect your cell phone, which is a popular item for theft
* Use the hotel safe to secure your valuables

### Checkpoints

To curb violent crime, the police may set up checkpoints across the country. Checkpoints are common along the A1 (North Coast Highway).

* Follow all traffic laws
* Be aware that you may be subject to searches by security forces
* Always cooperate with police officers
* Always carry valid ID and be prepared for various checkpoints
* Allow extra time to reach your destination
* Monitor local news to stay informed on the current situation

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Jamaican law prohibits sexual acts between individuals of the same sex. Other related offences include being in a same-sex marriage and the "promotion of homosexuality". Those convicted can face sentences of up to 10 years in prison, though authorities rarely enforce the law.

2SLGBTQI+ persons have experienced harassment and verbal or physical abuse. Though violence against 2SLGBTQI+ persons and their allies has declined significantly over the past decade, 2SLGBTQI+ travellers should:

* carefully consider the risks of travelling to Jamaica
* be cautious and avoid public displays of affection with someone of the same sex

### Women's safety

Women are often the target for unwanted attention. They should exercise caution when travelling alone.

There have been reports of sexual assaults at tourist resorts carried out by resort staff and, in some cases, by other tourists.

Be particularly vigilant if you are staying at a smaller or isolated establishment with less security. Compounds that are gated and guarded are considered the safest accommodation option in Jamaica.

* Be wary of strangers who seem unusually friendly
* Refrain from excessive drinking, especially at all-inclusive resorts
* Ensure that your hotel room doors and windows are locked

### Spiked food and drinks

Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers as they could be drugged and put you at risk of sexual assault and/or robbery.

### Fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud occurs. When using debit or credit cards:

* pay careful attention when others are handling your cards
* use ATMs located in public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

#### Romance scams

Internet romance scams via dating apps, websites or social media have occurred. Criminals especially target apps and websites popular among 2SLGBTQI+ travellers.

Assaults and incidents of robbery have occurred as a result of encounters set up through dating apps.

* Be wary of people who profess friendship or romantic interest over the internet
* Keep in mind that you may be the victim of a scam if you are travelling to Jamaica to meet an online contact
* Plan to meet in a known, secure location
* Be wary of inviting new acquaintances into your accommodation

#### Lottery scams

Tourists have been targets of lottery scams. Scammers convince targets that they have won a prize or lottery, but must pay a fee to claim their winnings.

* Never send money to someone in Jamaica who says you’ve won a lottery or prize
* Never travel to Jamaica to claim a “prize” or money

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations may occur. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation. Criminals often use these events to pickpocket demonstrators.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Water activities

#### Swimming

Coastal waters can be dangerous. Riptides are common.

Not all beaches have lifeguards or warning flags.

* Exercise caution when swimming
* Don’t swim alone, after hours or outside marked areas
* Consult residents and tour operators for information on possible hazards and safe swimming areas
* Follow the instructions of local authorities

#### Water sports

Tour operators may not adhere to international standards.

If you participate in water sports:

* choose a well-established and reputable company that has insurance
* ensure that safety equipment, such as helmets and life jackets, are available and in good condition
* ensure that your travel insurance covers the recreational activities you choose

If in doubt concerning the safety of the facilities or equipment, don’t use them.

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety can vary greatly throughout the country. Coastal roads are in fair condition but driving in inland can be dangerous due to:

* narrow, winding roads
* insufficient road maintenance
* poor lighting
* inadequate signage
* poor lane markings
* damage to roads during the hurricane season

Speeding, as well as driving under the influence of cannabis or alcohol, are common.

When driving between Norman Manley International Airport and Kingston, take the South Camp Road – also known as the Hummingbird Route – rather than Mountain View Avenue, where several robbery incidents have been reported.

Roadside assistance is available island-wide.

* Stay on main roads as much as possible
* Drive defensively
* Keep vehicle windows closed and doors locked
* Keep valuables out of sight

### Public transportation

Public transportation is generally not safe due to high levels of crime and overcrowding.

#### Buses

Knutsford Express offers safe, reliable and comfortable bus transportation between major towns.

Avoid travelling on local city buses.

#### Taxis and ridesharing services

Avoid taking unmarked taxis due to the risk of robbery and sexual assault.

Use only taxis ordered from hotels and authorized by the Jamaica Union of Travellers Association (JUTA). These are identified by red-and-white “PP” licence plates and a lime-green JUTA sticker on the window.

* Agree on the fare with the driver before departure, since taxis aren’t metered
* Don’t share a taxi with strangers

Ridesharing services are also available and generally safe. If you use a trusted ridesharing app, confirm the driver’s identity and the licence plate before getting in the car.
