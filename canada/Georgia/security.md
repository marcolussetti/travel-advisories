# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Political tensions

There are ongoing political tensions in Georgia. Political demonstrations take place regularly, particularly in central Tbilisi and can become violent.

[For more information on demonstrations](#demonstrations)

### Abkhazia and South Ossetia

The administrative boundary lines between Georgia, South Ossetia and Abkhazia are not well defined and change frequently. The Russian military and border guards regularly patrol the area. You could be detained and arrested if you cross into South Ossetia and Abkhazia, even by mistake.

The checkpoints with South Ossetia and Abkhazia are only open a few days a month and are subject to unexpected and prolonged closures.

Tensions are high in both occupied regions. Unexploded ordnance, explosions and landmines may pose a risk where military operations have occurred, especially in areas along the administrative boundary lines with South Ossetia and Abkhazia and near the border with Azerbaijan (Red Bridge area).

Terrorists have carried out attacks in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. They typically use car bombs to target military and security facilities.

If you choose to travel to South Ossetia or Abkhazia despite this advisory:

* be aware of your surroundings at all times
* only cross at official checkpoints
* carry valid ID with you at all times
* monitor local media to stay informed on the security situation and on checkpoint closures

Canadian officials may not be in a position to provide consular assistance to Canadians in these areas, due to security concerns and travel restrictions.

### Russian border regions

Georgian authorities only recognize the Kazbegi-Verkhnii Lars border crossing with Russia. If you choose to travel to the Russian border regions despite this advisory, avoid crossing at unofficial land borders connecting to the following Russian republics:

* Chechnya
* Dagestan
* Ingushetia
* Kabardino-Balkaria
* Karachay-Cherkessia

### Kidnapping

Kidnappings have occurred in Abkhazia, South Ossetia and other areas bordering Russia.

If you travel to these areas despite the advisories in effect:

* don’t walk alone, especially after dark
* vary your itinerary
* keep doors and windows locked at all times
* don’t show signs of affluence
* exercise vigilance in crowded places, such as markets and public transportation facilities

### Terrorism

There is a low threat of terrorism, but an attack can occur at any time.

Although there have been no recent attacks, there is a terrorist threat due to the return of Georgian fighters from abroad and the use of the country as a transit route between North Caucasus and the Middle East.

Targets could include:

* government buildings
* schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

Be particularly vigilant during:

* sporting events
* religious holidays
* public celebrations
* major political events, such as elections

Terrorists may use such occasions to mount attacks.

### Demonstrations

Political demonstrations take place regularly in Georgia, especially in central Tbilisi and around election periods.

Local authorities may heighten security measures, especially around government buildings. Security forces may also strongly repress demonstrators and carry out arrests.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Expect enhanced security measures and an increased police presence
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations
* Be prepared to modify your plans in case of disturbances

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs, especially in crowded urban areas and at public gatherings.

* Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents are secure at all times
* Avoid showing signs of affluence or wearing expensive jewellery
* Avoid carrying large sums of cash or unnecessary valuables
* Keep doors and windows locked at all times

#### Violent crime

Violent crimes targeting foreigners occur occasionally. Incidents include:

The police patrol frequently, but their response in remote areas and outside of larger cities can be significantly longer.

During your stay:

* be aware of your surroundings at all times

### Fraud

ATM and credit card fraud occurs.

Be cautious when using debit or credit cards.

* Avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* Cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* Check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

#### Romance scams and overcharging

Romance scams on dating sites or through social media have occurred. Typical scenarios involve locals luring tourists met online into bars or nightclubs. Tourists are forced to pay high bills after ordering expensive food and drinks.

Discussions about overcharging have turned violent. Tourists have been threatened and forced to pay the bill by the establishment's security guards.

* Beware of people who show a keen interest online
* Always meet new acquaintances in a secure and familiar location
* Always confirm the price of an item before ordering

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

2SLGBTQI+ persons have been subject to harassment and violence due to their identity and sexual orientation.

There have also been violent attacks against 2SLGBTQI+ persons during the Pride festivities in Tbilisi, resulting in casualties.

Georgian law doesn’t criminalize sexual acts or relationships between persons of the same sex.

However, 2SLGBTQI+ persons could be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or sex characteristics.

2SLGBTQI+ persons should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Georgia.

### Women’s safety

Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment or verbal abuse.

Sexual assaults have been committed, including against foreign women.

If you’re the victim of a sexual assault, you should report it immediately to the nearest Canadian consulate or embassy and seek medical assistance. You should also report the incident to Georgian authorities and ensure that local police will file the report with the Prosecutor’s Office of Georgia.

During your stay:

* avoid deserted streets at night and isolated areas
* don’t travel by yourself in a taxi, especially at night

### Landmines

Due to previous military operations, landmines and unexploded ordnance may pose a threat to your safety in various areas of Georgia, including:

* near the Red Bridge border crossing with Azerbaijan
* in South Ossetia, Abkhazia and along the administrative boundary lines

If you choose to travel to these areas:

* stay on main and paved roads
* avoid walking in fields
* avoid roadside ditches, shoulders and unmarked trails
* pay attention to signs indicating the possible presence of landmines and unexploded ordnance
* keep in mind that landmines and unexploded ordnance fields may not always be clearly marked

### Adventure tourism

Adventure tourism, such as zip-lining, rock climbing or trekking, can be dangerous, especially if they are not well-organized. Trails are not always marked and weather conditions can change rapidly.

Tour operators may not meet international standards.

If you are participating in adventure tourism:

* never do so alone, and do not part with your tour companions
* consider hiring an experienced guide from a reputable company
* obtain detailed information on your activity and on the environment in which you will be setting out
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to tackle the challenges of your activity
* avoid venturing off marked trails
* refrain from using equipment if you have doubts on their safety

### Road safety

#### Road conditions

Road conditions vary considerably across the country and fatal accidents are frequent.

Roads are generally in good condition in Tbilisi and in major cities. However, they are sometimes poorly maintained and dangerous in rural areas due to:

* unpaved and uneven surfaces
* raised and sunken manholes
* stray livestock
* lack of traffic signs
* insufficient lighting

In rural areas, traffic signs may only be written in Georgian.

#### Driving habits

Road accidents are one of the main causes of death in Georgia. It is common for drivers to:

* fail to maintain one lane
* drive at excessive speeds
* drive under the influence
* engage in road rage

Pedestrians often cross in the middle of the road and drivers don’t always give pedestrians the right of way. If you drive in Georgia:

* always drive defensively
* don’t engage with drivers showing signs of road rage
* plan your trip in advance, especially if you are visiting rural areas
* avoid travelling after dark
* always carry a cell phone and charger

#### Right of way

The right of way system is in effect in Georgia.

Drivers must yield to vehicles coming from the right at intersections if they are not in a priority lane, and to vehicles entering roundabouts.

### Public transportation

#### Taxis

In Georgia, taxis are regulated and vehicles are recognizable by their white colour and roof-mounted taxi signs. However, unofficial taxis continue to operate and drivers generally don’t use meters. They may overcharge you for the ride.

Drivers can be reckless and drive at excessive speed.

Ride-sharing apps are popular throughout Georgia.

If you choose to take taxis during your stay:

* arrange your pickup with a reputable company before arrival when travelling by air, or use authorized cabs at the airport
* order your taxi at the reception if you are staying at a hotel
* don’t use unmarked taxis
* never share a taxi with strangers
* negotiate the fare in advance
* have small bills available for payment

#### Buses and metro

Buses and metro are generally safe and reliable, but pickpockets may target tourists.

Mini-buses called "marshrutka" are poorly maintained and often lack security features like seatbelts.

* Always carry your valuables and identification with you
* Avoid storing bags in the overhead compartment or under your seat
* Don't take buses that look overloaded or in poor condition

#### Trains

The condition and cleanliness of trains vary greatly from route to route.

* Make sure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Don’t leave your compartment unattended
* Keep the door locked from the inside
