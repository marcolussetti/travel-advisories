## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Transfer to a Canadian prison

Canada and Georgia are signatories to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in Georgia to request a transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both Canadian and Georgian authorities.

This process can take a long time, and there is no guarantee that the transfer will be approved by either or both sides.

Reforms are underway to improve the efficiency and the transparency of the judicial system, but if you are arrested in Georgia, you could be detained for several months and there could be long delays to resolve your case.

### Drugs

In 2017, Georgia decriminalized cannabis and various cannabis-based products for personal use. Production, distribution and sale remain illegal. Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect jail sentences and heavy fines.

### Medication

Some prescription medication may not be available in Georgia.

If you take prescription medication, you’re responsible for determining their legality in the country.

Georgian authorities strictly regulate the possession and import of prescription medication under special control, including narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, and some over-the-counter medication that is commonly available in Canada.

* Bring a sufficient supply of your medication
* Carry a copy of your prescriptions along with an English translation
* Declare all medications in your possession to customs officials upon entry
* Always keep your medication in the original container
* Pack your medication in your carry-on luggage

If you carry illegal prescription medication according to Georgian Law, you could face deportation and jail sentences.

Contact the nearest diplomatic representation of Georgia for more information on imports of medication.

### Photography

Taking photographs of military installations or government buildings may result in a penalty.

You should seek permission from local authorities before taking photographs.

### Military service

Georgian-Canadian dual citizens may be subject to military service.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Georgia.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Georgia, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Georgian court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Georgia to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Surrogacy

In 2023, the government of Georgia proposed a law to prohibit surrogacy arrangements to foreigners.

If you’re planning to visit Georgia for the purpose of commissioning surrogacy arrangements, you should consider the potential challenges involved in pursuing international surrogacy and seek legal advice on Georgian and Canadian laws and citizenship procedures prior to making any arrangements.

Same-sex couples may encounter issues when engaging in surrogacy arrangements in Georgia.

The Embassy of Canada to Türkiye in Ankara is unable to provide recommendations on surrogacy arrangements.

### Money

The currency of Georgia is the lari (GEL).

U.S. dollars and euros are widely accepted and exchanged for local currency.

Credit cards may not be widely accepted in rural areas.

* Avoid exchanging money in unlicensed facilities
* Make sure you have cash at all times for payment

### Currency declaration

There are restrictions on the import and export of currency. You must declare to customs officials if you have more than 30 000 GEL or its equivalent in your possession.

This requirement applies to:

* cash
* checks
* any other type of financial instrument

Failure to comply with this requirement could result in fines and confiscation.
