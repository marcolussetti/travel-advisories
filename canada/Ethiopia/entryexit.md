# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

### Health screening measures

Due to the ongoing Mpox outbreak, travellers arriving from certain countries must complete a health declaration form before entering Ethiopia. This requirement also applies to individuals in transit who leave the airport.

If you show symptoms of Mpox, you may be required to undergo additional testing. Check with your airline to confirm if you need to complete the form.

### Entry and overstay fines

You must have your passport stamped immediately upon entry into Ethiopia. You must also either leave Ethiopia or request an extension before you overstay your visa.

If you do not comply, you could face heavy entry and overstay fines.

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from Ethiopian authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you use for travel.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond the date you expect to leave Ethiopia.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Entry and overstay fines

You must have your passport or other travel documents stamped by Ethiopian officials when you enter the country. You will also need to request an extension of stay from the local authorities if you plan to remain in Ethiopia longer than specified on your visa.

If there are no immigration officials present when you enter the country, you should declare your presence with the local authorities as soon as possible.

You face heavy fines and possibly arrest and detention if you do not comply. These fines are cumulative, the amount will increase for each day you remain in Ethiopia without a stamped passport or over the amount of time permitted by your visa.

You will not be permitted to leave Ethiopia until you have paid all entry and overstay fines in full.

### Other entry and exit requirements

Authorities may request additional documents if you enter Ethiopia by vehicle at certain border crossings.

Contact the Embassy of Canada to Ethiopia, in Addis Ababa, to determine specific entry requirements at land borders.

### Electronics and military equipment

You may not bring many consumer electronics to Ethiopia, including any items that customs officials may consider to have a military application. This could apply to items purchased commercially with non-military applications. This could include:

* satellite phones
* binoculars
* drones
* rangefinders

If you attempt to enter Ethiopia without official approval for any of these items, customs officials may confiscate your belongings. You could also face arrest and detention. Any items confiscated on entry may not be returned.

If you will be using these items for work, you should obtain permission to bring them into the country from the Embassy of Ethiopia in Ottawa or the Consulate of Ethiopia in Toronto.
