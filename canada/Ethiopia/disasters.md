### Increase in seismic activity

Since January 2025, there has been an increase in seismic activity in Ethiopia, especially in the Afar and Oromia regions and in areas east of Addis Ababa. Further earthquakes are possible.

Although there have been no casualties, evacuation orders have been issued in several of the affected areas.

If you are in or near an affected area:

* monitor local media for the latest information
* keep a supply of water and food and an emergency kit on hand
* keep your phone charged and have a list of emergency numbers
* follow instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders

### Drought

Due to below-average rainfall for several years in a row, Ethiopia is experiencing severe drought.

Local services and the availability of water and basic food may be affected.

You may encounter difficulties travelling overland.

### Rainy season

The rainy season normally extends from June to September. Seasonal flooding can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable due to mudslides and landslides.

* Monitor local media for the latest updates, including road conditions
* Stay away from flooded areas
* Follow instructions from local authorities, including evacuation orders
