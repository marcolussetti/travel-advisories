## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Death penalty

Ethiopian authorities may apply the death penalty for serious offences.

### Drugs

All illicit drugs are illegal except khat, a local stimulant. Khat is illegal in several countries. Don’t attempt to export it.

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect lengthy jail sentences and heavy fines.

Ethiopia is used as a drug trafficking hub between Western markets and southern Asia for heroin.

* Carry only your personal belongings, and don’t leave them unattended
* Don’t agree to carry packages that are not your own

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Ethiopian law prohibits sexual acts between individuals of the same sex. Those convicted can face up to 15 years in prison.

2SLGBTQI+ persons should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Ethiopia.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Ethiopia.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of Ethiopia, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Ethiopia.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Ethiopia by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Ethiopia to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Identification

You must carry photo ID with you at all times, as local authorities can ask you to prove your identity.

Keep a photocopy of your passport in a safe place, in case it is lost or confiscated.

### Firearms

It’s illegal to carry a firearm in Ethiopia.

### Ivory

It’s illegal to own any quantity of ivory, including in jewellery.

### Antiques or religious paraphernalia

You may not export real antiques or religious items.

Tourist souvenirs are often copies of Ethiopian antiques or religious paraphernalia.

If buying such items, ensure that you have a receipt, clearly indicating that it’s a souvenir and not authentic. However, be aware that authorities may confiscate items purchased for export or for personal use, especially ceremonial knives, even if you present a receipt.

### Photography

It’s strictly prohibited to photograph:

* military installations
* police and military personnel
* industrial facilities
* government buildings and infrastructure, including roads, bridges, dams and airfields

Never stop near a restricted area, no matter the reason, on foot or in a vehicle.

### Street vendors

It is illegal to give money to, or purchase something from, people who approach vehicles stopped in traffic, including children.

If caught, both the beggar/vendor and the vehicle operator face fines.

### Social media

Writing on blogs or social media about political subjects could lead to detention and arrest.

### Cell phones

You can use one cell phone or tablet on the network of the sole, state-owned telecommunications provider, Ethio Telecom.

Additional devices are subject to a customs fee of 10% of the total cost of the device, as well as the activation fee.

### Other electronic devices

You must declare all laptop computers and video equipment other than those for personal use upon arrival and departure. Some recording devices may require special customs permits.

If you will be using these items for work, obtain permission to bring them into the country from the Embassy of Ethiopia in Ottawa or the Consulate of Ethiopia in Toronto.

### Ramadan

In 2025, the lunar month of Ramadan is expected to begin on or around February 28.

In public, between sunrise and sunset, be discreet when:

* drinking
* eating
* smoking

### Orthodox Christian

The Ethiopian highlands population is predominantly Orthodox Christian. There is fasting in this region every Wednesday and Friday, and during Lent.

* Always obtain permission from religious authorities before visiting churches
* Dress conservatively, behave discreetly, and respect religious traditions to avoid offending local sensitivities

### Time of day

Many people in Ethiopia use the Ethiopian clock.

According to the Ethiopian clock, unlike the convention in most countries, the start of the day is dawn rather than midnight. As a result, daytime hours are counted beginning from what would be 6 a.m. For instance, the time at one hour after dawn – 7 a.m. –  would be 1 a.m. on the Ethiopian clock.

Most hotels and larger organisations, including all airlines, use the global clock. However, many individuals or smaller organisations continue to use the Ethiopian clock.

Check with your host if you are unsure which clock is being used for a meeting or an event.

### Driving

You must have a local driver’s licence to drive in Ethiopia. You must present your valid Canadian driver’s licence or an International Driving Permit to obtain one.

If you're involved in an accident, don’t move your vehicle before a police officer arrives. It's illegal to do so.

### Money

The currency of Ethiopia is the birr (ETB).

Credit cards are not widely accepted except by large hotels, travel agencies and a few shops and restaurants in Addis Ababa. ATMs are very limited outside urban areas and may run out of cash without notice.

Make sure you have access to hard-currency cash in case of emergency.

It is illegal to enter or exit Ethiopia with more than 1,000 birr.

You may enter or exit Ethiopia with up to US$3,000 or its equivalent in any convertible foreign currency. This doesn’t include birr. However:

* if you enter with more, you must declare the funds upon arrival
* if you exit with more, you must have at least one of the following:
  + a bank document certifying the purchase of the foreign currency and approving travel with the funds or
  + a customs declaration form made upon entry

Be aware that even the provision of such documents may not safeguard you against confiscation of the extra funds, imprisonment or fines. Policies may change at any time without notice.

Exchanging money on the black market is illegal. Exchange foreign currency at banks or official foreign exchange offices only as you may face heavy fines or detention.
