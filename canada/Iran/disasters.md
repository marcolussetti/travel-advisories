The weather is very dry and hot from May to October. Dust storms and sand storms may occur during the summer months.

Sand-laden winds can blow at high speeds for days, creating difficult driving conditions. Poor visibility can also affect flights. These storms can also cause respiratory problems, which can be fatal in some individuals.

If a dust storm is occurring:

* stay indoors

* be prepared to change your travel plans on short notice, including cutting short or cancelling your trip
* monitor local media for up-to-date information on the situation

### Rainy season

The rainy season extends from November to March. During the rainy season, flooding, including flash flooding, can occur.

Seasonal flooding can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable, due to mudslides and landslides. Bridges, buildings and infrastructure may be damaged.

* Monitor local media for the latest updates, including those on road conditions
* Stay away from flooded areas
* Monitor local news and weather reports
