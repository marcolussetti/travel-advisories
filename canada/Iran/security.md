### Tensions in the Middle East

There are ongoing tensions in the region and hostilities could resume with little or no warning. During previous attacks, drones, missiles and other projectiles struck targets in Iran.

Iranian airspace is open, however commercial flight options may be limited.

Heightened tensions could result in:

* travel disruptions, including flight cancellations and airspace closures
* military debris falling in various locations

Canada is unable to provide assistance within Iran, including transportation to the border. It’s possible to cross the land border into Türkiye and Armenia.

Restrictions to movement could occur.

You must have valid travel documents. If you have dual Canadian-Iranian citizenship, Iranian border officials require you to exit Iran on your Iranian passport.

You should:

* ensure your travel documents are up-to-date
* monitor local and international media to stay informed of the rapidly evolving situation
* follow the instructions of local authorities at all times
* register or update your personal information through the [Registration of Canadians Abroad service](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/registration "https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/registration") to receive the latest information from the Government of Canada
* ensure that you have sufficient supplies of cash, medication, food, fuel and water in case you need to shelter in place

If you encounter any debris or fragments:

* move away from them immediately
* contact local authorities

### Demonstrations

In December 2025, protests erupted across Iran for several weeks, including in Tehran, resulting in clashes between protestors and security forces. The violence led to mass casualties and arrests.

The possibility of renewed demonstrations and a violent response from security forces remains.

There are ongoing disruptions to telecommunications services, including internet access, social media and messaging applications.

Large-scale political demonstrations, gatherings and violent protests take place unpredictably across Iran. Security forces may strongly repress demonstrators, which may lead to numerous arrests, injuries and casualties. In some cases, arrested individuals were sentenced to death for charges arising from their participation in the demonstrations.

The situation is volatile and could escalate without notice. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. Security forces could use excessive and lethal force to disperse crowds. Protests can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Monitor local and international media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Increased surveillance and scrutiny

Canadians in Iran are likely to be subject to increased surveillance and scrutiny by Iranian authorities, including for activities and behaviours that would be considered normal in Canada, including:

* taking photographs in public places
* travelling to remote areas not usually frequented by tourists
* interacting with the local population

Keep a low profile and don’t share your personal information with strangers.

### Border areas

#### Pakistan and Afghanistan

Bandits in border areas with Afghanistan and Pakistan are usually involved in drug trafficking and use kidnapping to secure the release of group members from prison.

Sistan-Baluchistan, which borders Pakistan, is regularly affected by ethnic conflicts and is also a known route for smugglers. Foreign nationals have been the target of kidnappings.

Terrorist attacks may also occur in this province.

If you decide to travel overland to Pakistan and Afghanistan despite this warning:

* travel only on main roads
* travel in organized groups
* avoid travel after dark

#### Iraq

The province of Khuzestan borders Iraq. It is regularly affected by ethnic conflicts. Foreign nationals have been the target of kidnappings.

Border with Iraq is usually closed. It can be opened on a case-by-case basis to allow the passage of certain foreigners or to give refugees access to containment camps located on the Iranian side of the border.

#### Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan

The borders with Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan are open only to citizens of those countries.

Foreigners travelling in the vicinity of these sensitive borders often attract the attention of local security forces, which can result in short periods of detention.

### Terrorism

There is an increased threat of attacks against Western interests and of terrorist attacks in general. The security situation could worsen rapidly and with little warning.

Attacks have targeted:

* foreign interests
* Iranian military and government establishments
* tourist attractions and popular public places
* nightclubs and entertainment venues
* public transportation
* airports

Further attacks may occur, and terrorists may also target:

* crowded places
* places with high pedestrian traffic where foreigners may gather
* commercial establishments
* local government offices
* public transit stations
* busy streets
* places of worship

Exercise a high degree of caution at all times.

### Crime

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping for ransom can occur, especially in Baluchistan and in the border areas with Afghanistan and Pakistan. Foreign nationals have also been the target of kidnapping.

Use varied and unpredictable routes and schedules when moving from one place to another.

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs. Violent crime affects both Iranians and foreigners.

Thieves often target four-wheel-drive vehicles.

Plainclothes individuals may pose as police officers and ask to see foreign currency and passports. If you are approached, you should politely decline to cooperate but offer to go to the nearest police station.

* Avoid showing signs of affluence, such as flashy jewellery
* Ensure personal belongings, including your passports and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Carry a photocopy of your passport’s identification page at all times and leave a photocopy with a relative
* Don’t surrender any documents or cash
* Stay in touch with family and friends, especially if you’re travelling alone
* Avoid walking after dark

### Women's safety

Women may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse. Gender-based violence is common in Iran.

Some Canadian and Canadian-Iranian women have been stranded in Iran or mistreated by an Iranian husband or a male relative. Local authorities consider domestic violence to be a private matter and rarely discuss it in public.

Women and children require the permission of the husband, or an Iranian male head of household, to obtain a passport or travel document. They also require permission to leave the country.

The dress code is strictly enforced in Iran. Women must wear a headscarf and a long jacket that covers the arms and upper legs while in public.

### Water shortages

Drought regularly contributes to severe water shortages in Tehran and several provinces. Local authorities may ration water supplies, and running water may not always be available.

If you’re in Iran:

* keep supplies of bottled water and water purification tablets on hand
* expect limits on the availability of drinkable water

monitor local media to stay informed of the evolving situation

### Power outages

Power outages occur frequently, especially in winter, and can last for several hours.

They can affect the following services and businesses:

* public lighting and traffic lights
* telecommunications and security systems
* stores and food supply
* hotels and other accommodations
* banks and ATMs

If you are in Iran:

* be prepared for prolonged power outages
* make sure you always have a complete emergency kit on hand, including several flashlights
* always carry a cell phone, power banks, chargers and keep a list of emergency numbers handy

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety can vary greatly throughout the country, and city streets are poorly lit. The highway system is relatively well developed.

Trucks run mostly at night, often without headlights. Motorists are reckless and don’t respect traffic laws. They almost never give way to pedestrians at designated crossing points. Parked cars may obstruct sidewalks on main roads in urban areas. Sidewalks are rare in residential areas.

Expect roadblocks and checkpoints.

* Avoid travelling at night
* Consider hiring a personal driver who’s familiar with local conditions
* If you are involved in an accident, remain at the scene until authorities arrive

### Public transportation

#### Taxis

Most taxis don’t have meters. Drivers often overcharge foreigners.

* Only hire official taxis from agencies or hotel-based companies
* Take pre-booked official taxis, which are safer than those hailed from the street
* Negotiate fares in advance, or insist that the driver use the meter
* Never enter a cab if it already has one or more passengers
* Note the licence plate number and name of the driver when you travel
* Immediately communicate this information to family or friends

#### Railway transport

Trains are comfortable and punctual, but service is limited and slow.

### Sea travel

Iran and the United Arab Emirates both claim sovereignty over the islands in the Gulf and the military patrols the waters. Foreigners navigating Iranian waters have been arrested and detained. In September 2019, Iranian authorities specifically called for the seizure of Canadian assets and vessels.

Exercise caution if travelling by sea, including for recreational purposes, particularly around the disputed islands of Abu Musa and Tunb.

### Air travel

We don't make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.
