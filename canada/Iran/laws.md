## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

Iran is under [international and Canadian sanctions](https://www.international.gc.ca/world-monde/international_relations-relations_internationales/sanctions/iran.aspx?lang=eng). While these sanctions don’t prohibit travel to Iran, they could be relevant to your travel.

### Legal system

The Iranian legal system differs from the one in Canada.

You may be held for lengthy periods without access to legal counsel or consular officials if you are suspected of or witness to offences.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs and alcohol are severe. Convicted offenders can expect severe penalties, including the death penalty.

[Drugs, alcohol and travel](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/drugs)

### Religion

Iran is an Islamic theocratic republic. A conservative interpretation of Islamic practices and beliefs is closely adhered to in the country’s customs, laws, and regulations.

Islamic law is strictly enforced. Breach of public morality, non-compliance with dress-code and making disparaging remarks about Islam, the clergy and religious symbols, including on social networks, are considered serious offences. They are punished severely.

Former Muslims who have converted to other religions have been subject to arrest and prosecution.

* Respect local traditions, customs, laws and religion at all times
* Be aware of your actions and behaviour

### Ramadan

In 2025, the lunar month of Ramadan is expected to begin on or around February 28.

In public, between sunrise and sunset, refrain from:

* drinking
* eating
* smoking

### Dress and behaviour

Iranian customs, laws and regulations reflect the conservative interpretation of traditional and Islamic practices and beliefs adhered to by the Iranian authorities.

To avoid offending local sensitivities:

* dress conservatively
* behave discreetly
* respect religious and social traditions

Shorts are considered inappropriate attire for both men and women.

Women should carry a headscarf to cover their head at all times while travelling in Iran.

There are reports indicating that the police are using surveillance cameras to identify and monitor women who don’t wear the hijab in public places, as required by Iranian law. Employers and owners of businesses such as stores, restaurants, cafés and shopping malls face closure and prosecution if they don’t enforce the hijab law.

If you promote unveiling while you are in Iran, you could face criminal charges.

Women who fail to comply with the law may face:

* arrest and detention
* jail sentences
* restricted access to public institutions such as hospitals, schools, airports and other social services.
* restricted access to mobile phones and Internet
* fines

### Intimate and extramarital relations

Public displays of affection between two people of the opposite sex, especially between a non-Muslim man and a Muslim woman, is not well socially accepted.

If you engage in extramarital relationships, you may be subject to severe penalties, including the death penalty.

### Marriage

Canadian women who register their marriage with the Iranian authorities automatically become Iranian citizens. They are treated as such by Iranian law.

Marriage between an Iranian and a foreigner is subject to the rules of conduct and Islamic laws. As such, an Iranian husband may prevent his wife and children from leaving Iran, even if they are of foreign nationality.

### Family law

Iranian and Canadian family law systems are significantly different.

Iran doesn’t automatically recognize the orders of Canadian courts in matters of family law.

#### Divorce

A Canadian divorce certificate is not automatically recognized in Iran.

You must get the Canadian divorce certificate authenticated by a Canadian Embassy prior to have it sanctioned by an Iranian Court for it to be recognized under Iranian law.

If an Iranian court doesn’t sanction your divorce, and you return to Iran as a woman, your ex-husband may request the Iranian authorities to confiscate your passport. As a husband, authorities may not allow you to leave Iran if you have not paid the dowry to your wife after divorce.

#### Children custody

Iran isn’t a signatory to The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction.

Children of a male Iranian national, including Canadian-Iranian citizens, are in the sole custody of their father. They require their father’s permission to leave Iran.

To avoid any difficulties in Iran, consult a Canadian and an Iranian lawyer before travelling. If you're involved in local legal proceedings such as divorce or custody, seek legal advice regarding your rights and responsibilities.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Iran.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Iran by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Iran to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

Iranian law criminalizes sexual acts and relationships between persons of the same sex.

2SLGBTQI+ persons could also be discriminated against or detained based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or sex characteristics.

If you are convicted, you could face corporal punishment, imprisonment or the death penalty.

2SLGBTQI+ persons should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Iran.

### Dual citizenship

Iran doesn’t legally recognize dual citizenship.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of Iran, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

If you're a Canadian-Iranian citizen, you must enter and exit Iran using your Iranian passport. You may also not be able to leave Iran unless you meet certain conditions.

Canadians, particularly dual Canadian-Iranian citizens, are at risk of:

* being arbitrarily questioned, arrested or detained
* having their passport confiscated

Canadian-Iranian dual citizens should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Iran.

#### Mandatory military service

Military service is mandatory for male Iranian citizens aged 18 to 34, unless exempt. This also applies to dual Canadian-Iranian citizens, even those born in Canada.

If you are a Canadian-Iranian citizen older than 17 years, and planning to visit Iran, check your military service obligation prior to your travel. You may not be allowed to leave Iran without first having completed your military service.

### Communications and political activities

Communications are closely scrutinized by local authorities. You may face severe consequences if you discuss, share or publish information on the political situation or criticize the regime in place, including on social media.

### Photography

It is prohibited to photograph (including with drones);

* government buildings
* security forces, military and police installations and vehicles
* public buildings, including airports, ports, bridges, embassies and power plants

Such sites are not always well identified. In doubt, seek permission, or refrain from taking the photo.

Always ask permission before taking photographs of local residents.

The currency in Iran is the Iranian rial (IRR).

The economy is exclusively cash-based. Credit cards aren’t accepted in Iran. ATMs exist only for local banking, for the use of Iranians. Due to international sanctions, it’s not possible to transfer funds to Iran using commercial banking system or money transfer company.

* Bring sufficient cash, preferably in U.S. dollars or euros
* Note that U.S. banknotes used must be in crisp condition
