## Safety and security

### Tensions in the Middle East

The security situation remains unpredictable and could deteriorate significantly with little or no warning.

This may result in travel disruptions, including flight cancellations and airspace closures.

You should:

* monitor local and international media to stay informed of the rapidly evolving situation
* be vigilant and follow the instructions of local authorities at all times
* Register or update your contact information with the [Registration of Canadians Abroad](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/registration "https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/registration") service to receive the latest information from the Government of Canada

### Border with Yemen

Avoid approaching the Yemeni border due to the ongoing conflict in Yemen. Crossing the Yemen–Oman border can be difficult and very dangerous. Houthi militias and other forces operating in Yemen do not normally engage in cross-border exercises. However, you should be extremely cautious near the border due to the potential spillover of violence.

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism. On July 16, 2024, a shooting took place at a mosque in the Wadi Al Kabir area, in Muscat, resulting in several casualties.

Additional attacks could occur.

Targets could also include:

* government buildings
* schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* Western interests
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners
* cultural venues

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.

Be particularly vigilant during:

* sporting events
* religious holidays
* public celebrations
* major political events, such as elections

Terrorists may use such occasions to mount attacks.

### Crime

The crime rate is low and violence is rare. Robbery and auto theft occur. Do not show signs of affluence, and ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times.

* Do not travel alone after dark
* Lock car doors and keep windows closed
* Do not leave vehicles unattended
* Upon returning to your vehicle, inspect both its exterior and interior for any attached device or suspicious package
* Be suspicious of mail and packages from unfamiliar sources
* Contact your visa sponsor or the police if you suspect anything unusual

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations may occur. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Women’s safety

Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse.

Women have been detained when reporting sexual assault, as they must prove that the sex was not consensual to avoid being charged. Oman’s laws criminalize extramarital sex.

### Road safety

Roads conditions in Oman are generally good. Exercise caution when driving in rural areas, especially after dark, because of roaming animals, insufficient lighting, speeding drivers and limited visibility.

Rainfall can cause significant flooding on roads, particularly during the rainy season.

Off-road driving can be hazardous. If engaging in off-road driving:

* drive in a convoy of four-wheel-drive vehicles and with an experienced guide only
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary
* be well prepared and equipped with gasoline, water, food and a cellular or satellite phone if you are driving in the desert areas of Wahiba and Rub’ Al Khali

Cell phones may have limited or no service in remote areas, which can become especially dangerous if you experience vehicle problems while driving in desert areas.

### Public Transportation

Taxis are generally safe.

* Use only officially marked taxis
* Negotiate fares in advance, or insist that the driver use the meter, as you may be overcharged

### Air travel

We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.

### Sea travel

Exercise caution if travelling by sea, including for recreational purposes, in the Gulf of Oman and the Northern Arabian Sea regions due to an increased risk of maritime attack.

### Piracy

Pirate attacks and armed robbery against ships occur in coastal waters of the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean and, in some cases, farther out at sea. Mariners should take appropriate precautions.

### Adventure tourism

Only undertake adventure sports, such as zip-lining and rock climbing, with a well-established and reputable company that has insurance.

Tour operators may not adhere to international standards. If you have any doubt concerning the safety of the installation or equipment, refrain from using them. Ensure that the recreational activities you choose are covered by your travel insurance.

If engaging in adventure tourism:

* never do so alone and always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* ensure that you’re properly equipped and well informed about weather and other conditions that may  pose a hazard
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary
* obtain detailed information on each activity before setting out and do not venture off marked trails
