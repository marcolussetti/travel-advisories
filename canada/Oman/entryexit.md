# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

The authorities of a country or territory decide who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from Omani authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

The Government of Canada can’t facilitate your entry into or exit from Oman.

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond the date of entry to Oman.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

The Omani authorities may deny you entry if your passport shows an X in the “sex” field or if it includes an observation to that effect.

### Visas

Tourism visa: not required for stays up to 14 days  
 Business visa: required  
 Student visa: required

You can obtain and pay for a visa upon arrival at Muscat International Airport. You can also apply for an e-visa before you travel through the Royal Oman Police portal.

### Employment

Omani employers must obtain a work visa and a single-entry for you, either before or after you arrive. Omani employers often insist on retaining foreign employees’ passports as a condition of employment. This practice is illegal. Do not agree to this, as it could restrict your ability to travel and provide leverage to the employer in disputes.

### Regional travel

Canadians have been denied entry into Oman because their passports bore an Israeli visa, an Israeli border stamp, or an Egyptian or Jordanian border stamp issued by an office bordering Israel. Such a stamp would indicate the traveller has been in Israel.

### Restricted zones

Some areas of the country are considered of strategic importance and cannot be visited without authorization from Omani authorities.
