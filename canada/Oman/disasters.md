## Natural disasters and climate

The rainy season extends from May to September. Seasonal flooding can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable and bridges damaged.

Flooding occurs in the far south during the rainy season. Heavy rains may cause wadis (dry riverbeds) to overflow, flooding underpasses and tunnels. Oman is subject to cyclones and tropical depressions, which are accompanied by strong winds and heavy rain. Flash floods and mudslides may occur.

Sand and dust storms occur during the dry season.
