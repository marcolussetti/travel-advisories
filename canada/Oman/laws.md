You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect lengthy jail sentences and heavy fines. The death penalty could apply.

Respect restrictions concerning the consumption of alcohol. Do not drink alcohol outside licensed hotels. Public intoxication is an offence.

#### Prescription drugs

Prescription or over-the-counter drugs that are legal in Canada, such as those containing codeine, may be restricted in Oman. Possession of such drugs could lead to a jail sentence. Carry your original prescription and keep prescription medications in their original container.

### Driving

You should carry an international driving permit.

Drivers involved in an accident must move their vehicles to the side of the road to reduce congestion. Anyone deemed responsible for a motor vehicle accident may be detained for 48 hours. Consult the [Royal Oman Police](http://www.rop.gov.om/english/index.html) for more information on traffic rules.

Follow traffic laws diligently. Penalties for violations, such as driving under the influence of alcohol, excessive speed, using a mobile phone, running a red light and failure to wear seat belts, are stringent. It is forbidden to use cellular phones while driving.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Oman.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of Oman, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

Children of an Omani father automatically acquire Omani citizenship at birth and must enter and leave the country on an Omani passport.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Oman.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Oman by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Oman to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Identification

You must carry photo identification. Keep a photocopy of your passport in a safe place, in case it’s lost or confiscated.

### Photography

Do not take photographs of individuals without prior authorization. It is prohibited to photograph public buildings and military or police vehicles.

### Child Custody

Child custody decisions are based on Islamic law (Sharia). It is difficult for a Western woman, even a Muslim, to obtain custody of her children through a court decision. Minor children of an Omani-national father must have their father’s permission to leave the country.

### Legal process

Witnesses to incidents, as well as suspects, may be held for lengthy periods without access to legal counsel or consular officials. If access is granted, it may be severely limited by the Omani authorities. Authorities may withhold the passport of an individual involved in a legal process, pending resolution of the case. This could result in the delay of a planned departure.

### Dress and behaviour

The country’s customs, laws and regulations adhere closely to Islamic practices and beliefs. Dress conservatively, behave discreetly and respect religious and social traditions to avoid offending local sensitivities. It is prohibited to wear military or similar clothing and accessories. Certain public areas may be restricted to men or women only. The work week is from Sunday to Thursday.

Sex outside legal marriage is forbidden. It is against the law to live together or share the same hotel room with someone of the opposite sex to whom you aren’t married or closely related. Adultery and prostitution are illegal and are subject to severe punishment, including the death penalty. Avoid physical contact or displays of affection in public, including kissing and holding hands.

Omani authorities do not permit criticism of the government, the sultan or the society in general.

### Ramadan

In 2025, the lunar month of Ramadan is expected to begin on or around February 28.

In public, between sunrise and sunset, refrain from:

* drinking
* eating
* smoking

### Offensive language

Exercise particular care in your behaviour with others, especially officials, to avoid offending local sensitivities. Do not use aggressive, vulgar or abusive language or gestures in public, including on social media. Verbal insults and obscene gestures may be considered a criminal act and, if found guilty, you could face deportation, fines and a prison sentence.

### Culturally acceptable content

Books, videotapes and audio tapes may be reviewed by airport and other customs authorities prior to being released to the owner to ensure that their content is culturally acceptable

Possession of pornographic material is forbidden.

### Money

The currency of Oman is the Omani Rial (OMR).

Credit cards and U.S. dollar traveller’s cheques are widely accepted.
