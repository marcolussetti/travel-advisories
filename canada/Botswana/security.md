# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Crime

Crime occurs throughout the country, including in Gaborone, but especially in border areas with South Africa, Zimbabwe and Namibia.

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and bag snatching, occurs frequently.

The following crimes are also common:

* theft, including of cars
* “smash-and-grabs” from parked cars and those stopped in traffic

Police may take longer than expected to respond. Police services may be below Canadian standards.

During your stay:

* keep doors and windows locked at all times
* avoid isolated areas
* keep your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, in a secure place and out of sight
* do not carry large sums of cash or valuables unnecessarily
* do not show signs of affluence or wear expensive jewellery

#### Violent and organized crime

Organized criminal networks smuggle weapons into Botswana. Illegal arms trafficking and use lead to violent spillovers and crime.

Violent crime occurs, including home burglaries and carjackings. Tourists are not usually targeted. However, you could be in the wrong place at the wrong time.

* Be aware of your surroundings at all times
* Avoid walking alone after dark
* Do not resist an attack

### Demonstrations

Although rare, demonstrations may occur, especially in Gaborone and around elections. Security forces have used force to disperse crowds. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### National parks and wildlife

National parks may not automatically provide you with a guide when you enter a park on your own. You should plan to hire a guide from a reputable company before travelling to a national park. Take your safety seriously at all times.

Wildlife areas are not always fenced, and there are few warning signs. Wild animals can be dangerous, particularly if you are on foot or at close range.

* Be aware of your surroundings at all times
* Only exit a vehicle when a professional guide or warden says it’s safe to do so
* Only use reputable and professional guides or tour operators
* Closely follow park regulations and wardens’ advice
* Do not go beyond the authorized limits, especially after dark, due to the risk of attack by wild animals

### Roads

#### Road safety

Fatal accidents are frequent in Botswana, especially due to:

* driving under the influence
* pedestrians, wildlife and stray livestock on the road
* cell phone use while driving

Emergency responders may take longer to reach you in rural areas.

#### Road conditions

Road conditions vary greatly throughout the country. Roads are generally in good condition in urban areas, but in rural areas, they can be dangerous due to:

* potholes
* unpaved roads
* uneven surfaces
* insufficient lighting

Driving conditions can be hazardous during the rainy and dry seasons. Roads and highways can quickly become flooded and slippery, and dust storms may significantly reduce visibility.

If you choose to drive in Botswana:

* always drive defensively
* plan your trip in advance and fill your gas tank before you travel, especially if you are visiting a rural area
* familiarize yourself with your itinerary before you leave
* avoid travelling after dark
* always carry a cell phone and a charger

#### Driving habits

Drivers can sometimes be extremely aggressive and/or reckless.

### Public transportation

#### Taxis

Taxis are widely available in major cities such as Gaborone and Francistown. You should only use taxis from reputable and licensed companies.

* Confirm the fare in advance
* Ask for your taxi at the front desk if you’re using hotel services
* Avoid hailing taxis on the street

#### Minibuses

Avoid using minibuses called “kombis”. They are often overcrowded and not always well maintained.
