### Climate change

Climate change is affecting Botswana. Extreme and unusual weather events are becoming more frequent and may affect your travel plans. Monitor local media for the latest information.

### Rainy season

The rainy season extends from November to March.

It can lead to severe flooding, especially in the Chobe District in northeastern Botswana, due to high water levels in the inland Okavango Delta, which floods the dry land of the Kalahari Desert every year.

Seasonal flooding can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable due to mudslides and landslides. Infrastructure may be damaged.

* Monitor local media for the latest information, including on road conditions
* Stay away from flooded areas
* Monitor weather reports
* Follow instructions from local authorities, including evacuation orders

### Drought

During the summer months, before episodes of rain, severe drought can significantly reduce the food and water supply, especially in the Kgalagadi, North-East and Central districts.

During droughts:

* plan accordingly
* always keep water supplies on hand
* follow the instructions of local authorities
