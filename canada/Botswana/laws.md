## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Identification

You must carry photo identification, such as a photocopy of your passport. Keep another photocopy of your passport in a safe place, in case it’s lost or confiscated.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized up to the age of 21 in Botswana. Dual citizens must renounce their foreign citizenship before they turn 21 if they want to keep their Botswanan citizenship.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of Botswana, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Botswana.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Botswana by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Botswana to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.
