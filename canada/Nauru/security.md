# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Tourist facilities

Tourist facilities are extremely limited.

If you travel to Nauru, plan adequately to minimize safety risks.

### Crime

The crime rate is low. Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, may occur.

Ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times.

### Water activities

#### Swimming

Lifeguards don’t usually supervise beaches. Tidal changes can cause powerful currents, and riptides are common.

Rescue services may not be consistent with international standards.

* Consult residents and tour operators for information on possible hazards and safe swimming areas
* Wear reef shoes to protect yourself against coral cuts and stonefish
* Follow the instructions and warnings of local authorities

#### Diving

Tour operators may not adhere to international standards.

If you undertake adventure sports, such as diving:

* choose a well-established and reputable company that has insurance
* ensure that your travel insurance covers the recreational activities you choose

If in doubt concerning the safety of the facilities or equipment, don’t use them
