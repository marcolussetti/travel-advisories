### Cyclone and monsoon seasons

The cyclone and rainy (monsoon) seasons occur from November to April. During this period, even small storms can quickly develop into major typhoons.

Severe storms can put you at risk and can hamper the provision of essential services.

If you decide to travel to Nauru during this time:

* know that you may expose yourself to serious safety risks
* be prepared to change your travel plans on short notice, including cutting short or cancelling your trip
* stay informed of the latest regional weather forecasts
* carry emergency contact information for your airline or tour operator
* follow the advice and instructions of local authorities

### Tsunamis

Nauru is located near an active seismic zone. Tsunamis may occur.

A tsunami can occur within minutes of a nearby earthquake. However, the risk of a tsunami can remain for several hours following the first tremor. If you’re staying in Nauru, familiarize yourself with the region’s evacuation plans in the event of a tsunami warning.
