# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Crime

#### Petty Crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs regularly, particularly in urban areas.

Thefts commonly occur:

* in popular tourist areas, including viewpoints
* on buses, at bus stations as well as in airport terminals
* in hotel lobbies
* at restaurants, including on patios located near streets

While in French Guiana:

* ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* avoid isolated or deserted areas
* avoid walking alone after dark
* avoid showing signs of affluence

#### Violent crime

Violent crime occurs occasionally.

Violent incidents commonly include burglaries of private homes, during which acts of violence are committed against the occupants.

* Stay in reputable accommodation with adequate security measures
* Keep doors and windows locked at all times
* In case of an attack, do not resist

### Fraud

Credit card, debit card, and ATM fraud can occur.

When using credit or debit cards at an ATM or with a card reader:

* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

### Adventure tourism

Outdoor activities, such as jungle expeditions and other adventure sports can be dangerous if unprepared. Trails are not always marked and weather conditions can change rapidly, even in the summer.

Some gold miners operating in the Amazon rainforest also carry out illegal activities. You could find yourself in the wrong place at the wrong time.

You may need a permit to access certain parts of the Amazon rainforest.

If you intend to participate in adventure tourism activities:

* never do so alone, and don’t part with your expedition companions
* obtain detailed information on your activity and on the environment in which you will be before setting out
* consider hiring an experienced guide from a reputable company
* inquire with the local authorities if the area where you plan to travel requires a special permit or permission
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* avoid venturing off marked trails
* ensure that you’re adequately equipped and bring sufficient water
* stay informed of weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* refrain from using facilities or equipment if you have doubts on their safety
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary

### Water activities

Coastal waters can be dangerous.

Tidal changes and strong winds can cause hazardous currents and riptides.

#### Swimming

Some beaches are unsupervised.

* Don’t swim alone
* Consult residents and tour operators for information on possible hazards and safe swimming areas
* Don’t dive into unknown waters, as hidden rocks or shallow depths can cause serious injury or death
* Always obey warning flags advertising dangerous conditions
* Watch out for weather alerts or warnings
* Follow the advice of local authorities

#### Boating

The rivers of French Guiana are, along with air travel, the only way to access the interior of the territory.

If you plan to navigate the river network:

* be sure that you have a good understanding of local laws and regulations
* engage an experienced guide from a reputable company
* do not overload your boat
* have personal safety devices available for all passengers
* carry a VHF marine radio to signal your position in case of an emergency

### Telecommunications

The telecommunications network is not always reliable.

Cellular service might be intermittent, especially outside of cities. It is non-existent in certain regions of the Amazon rainforest.

* Don’t rely on your cellphone in an emergency, especially outside of population centres
* Avoid travelling alone
* Inform a family member or friend of your itinerary

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations may occur.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

### Road safety

Road safety is overall very good throughout the territory.

#### Road conditions

Major roads are paved and well maintained.

Driving in remote areas could be dangerous due to:

* inadequate lighting
* insufficient road signage
* less-developed rural roads

#### Driving habits

Motorcyclists have little regard for traffic regulations. They could be reckless and drive at excessive speeds.

If you choose to drive in French Guiana:

* plan your route in advance, especially if you plan on travelling to rural areas
* avoid travelling after dark
* always carry a cellular phone and charger
* check local cellular phone coverage, which remains unstable in the Amazon rainforest
* advise a relative of your anticipated itinerary and route
* ask about insurance coverage options for roadside assistance when you rent a vehicle

### Public transportation

Public taxis and vans are relatively safe.

#### Buses

A bus service serves the communes of:

* Cayenne
* Montsinéry-Tonnegrande
* Remire-Montjoly

#### Taxis

Taxis and shared taxis are available in coastal areas.

Shared taxis don’t follow a set schedule. They leave for their destination when the van is full. In addition to shared taxis operated by private companies, the government provides a public shared taxi service, the TIG. Every TIG vehicle carries an identifying “TIG” sticker.

#### Ferry

A ferry service operates on the Maroni river, allowing passengers to cross the river border with Suriname.

#### Pirogues

Pirogues or dugout canoes equipped with outboard motors are the essential mode of public transportation along French Guiana’s river network. They are registered and security standards are generally respected.

Fares vary depending on the distance travelled.

Ensure to have life jackets available for all passengers.

### Air travel

We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.
