# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Crime

The crime rate is low. There are no serious security or safety concerns. Take normal security precautions and ensure personal belongings, including passports and travel documents, are secure at all times.

### Road safety

There are no roads or railways between towns. Travel is only possible by air, sea, ski, snowmobile or dogsled.

Arctic weather conditions may cause delays and interruptions in transport services. Carry enough funds to cover unexpected expenses.

### Adventure and arctic tourism

Adventure tourism may lead to serious safety concerns if not well-organized. Weather conditions can change rapidly, even in summer. In winter, heavy snowfall can make it difficult to reach certain areas. There is also a risk of avalanches, some of which can be fatal.

Most areas of Greenland are remote and inaccessible. Emergency services may not be able to respond in isolated areas.

Tourist facilities are limited. Main tourist centres are in:

* Nuuk
* Ilulissat
* Disko Bugt (or Disko Bay)
* southern Greenland
* Tasiilaq, in eastern Greenland

You must apply for a special permit at the Ministry of Domestic Affairs, Nature and Environment of Greenland to explore glaciers, mountains or the National Park in northeast Greenland.

If you undertake adventure tourism or climbing in Greenland:

* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary if going alone
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* ensure that you’re properly equipped
* ensure that you’re well informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* obtain detailed information on each activity before setting out

### Cruise ship travel

Unpredictable weather in Greenland may disrupt cruise ship travel and lead to rough seas, cancellation, delays and itinerary changes without notice. Rescue operations may also be very limited for ships in distress or stuck in mud and silt. In the winter season or during severe weather, rescue operations may not be possible.

If you decide to take a cruise in Greenland:

* choose a well-established and reputable cruise company
* ensure that your travel insurance covers cruise ship travel and includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
