# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Danish authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

Greenland is an autonomous territory the Kingdom of Denmark but not a part of the European Union nor the Schengen area. Greenland has its own entry and exit requirements.

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you're travelling with.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 3 months beyond the date you expect to leave from Greenland.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination.
