## Natural disasters and climate

### Climate change

Climate change is affecting Greenland. Extreme and unusual weather events are becoming more frequent and may affect your travel plans. Monitor local news to stay informed on the current situation.

### Extreme weather

The climate is extreme, especially during winter, with severe cold weather. The region is prone to heavy snowfall and snowstorms.

The interior of Greenland is cold, dry and windy. Â The vast majority of the island is covered in ice year-round. These conditions put you at risk of frostbite and sun overexposure, which can result in dehydration and eye damage.

Ensure that you have equipment and clothing that meet Arctic standards.
