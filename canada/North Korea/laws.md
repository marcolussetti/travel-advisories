You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

North Korea is subject to international and Canadian sanctions. These sanctions could be relevant to and affect your travel.

### Tourist laws

Foreigners will be met by a guide from the host organization upon arrival.

You must be accompanied by an official guide at all times. Follow all instructions from your guide.

Any behaviour deemed inappropriate by North Korea could lead to fines, arrest or detention, including everyday interactions such as:

* unauthorized conversations with locals
* currency exchange
* making a purchase in a store not designated for foreigners

Foreigners are prohibited from using public transportation.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect jail sentences and heavy fines.

* Pack your own luggage and monitor it closely at all times
* Never transport other people’s packages, bags or suitcases

### Imports and exports

Importation of satellite telephones and shortwave radios is prohibited. Such items are confiscated upon entry and usually returned upon departure.

You cannot enter or leave North Korea with local currency.

Authorities may seize any material that they deem to be pornographic, political or intended for religious proselytizing. The same applies to any material or literature printed in South Korea.

If you plan to bring material written in the Korean language, ensure that it will not be interpreted by local authorities as being against the interests of the North Korean regime.

You could be arrested and detained if you are involved in unsanctioned political or religious activity.

### Photography

It is prohibited to photograph:

* airports
* roads
* bridges
* seaports
* rail stations
* military personnel/facilities

Any photos or videos taken outside of tourist areas could result in the confiscation of your equipment or detention. Seek permission from your tour guide before taking photographs.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in North Korea.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of North Korea, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and North Korea.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in North Korea by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in North Korea to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Political criticism

* Kim Il Sung
* Kim Jong Il
* Kim Jong Un

### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

The status of 2SLGBTQI+ persons in North Korea is uncertain. North Korean law does not mention sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and sex characteristics. 2SLGBTQI+ persons are neither discriminated against nor protected under North Korean law.

Homosexuality is not widely accepted in North Korean society. 2SLGBTQI+ persons have experienced harassment and verbal abuse.
