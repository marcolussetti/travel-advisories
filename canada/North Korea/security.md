# Safety and security

## Safety and security

North Koreaâ€™s borders have been closed to travellers from most countries since 2020.

Entering North Korea could be extremely difficult. If you choose to travel to North Korea despite the advisory in place, register with the Embassy of Canada to the Republic of Korea, in Seoul, and the Embassy of Sweden to North Korea, in Pyongyang.

### Safety information

If you are detained, particularly outside of Pyongyang, Canadian and Swedish officials may not be able to provide consular assistance. The North Korean government exercises strict control over consular access. There is limited knowledge of the North Korean police and judicial systems, which may further affect our ability to assist you.

There are serious shortages of food, electricity and clean water.

You have no right to privacy. Your movements and communications may be under surveillance at any time. Your personal belongings may be searched, and authorities may review the contents stored on your electronic devices.

### Tensions on the Korean Peninsula

Tensions on the Korean Peninsula could escalate with little notice and the security situation could deteriorate suddenly. Tensions may increase before, during and after North Korean nuclear and missile tests, military exercises or as the result of incidents or military activities at or near the inter-Korean border.

There is extremely limited access to international media broadcasts in North Korea, and you may be taken by surprise by events that could affect your security.

### Crime

Petty crime occurs, especially at the Pyongyang Sunan International Airport. Keep your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, in a secure place.

### Roads

Foreigners are not allowed to drive, and travel is severely restricted. Tour guides or authorities provide transportation. Major highways are in good condition, while rural roads can be hazardous.

### Checkpoints

Police checkpoints are common throughout the country. You may be asked for identification at any time.

* Expect a heavy presence of security forces
* Be prepared to show your identification
* If stopped, follow the instructions of security forces

We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.
