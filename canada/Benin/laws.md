### 2SLGBTQI+ persons

The laws of Benin law do not prohibit sexual acts between individuals of the same sex. However, homosexuality is not widely accepted in Benin. Homosexual behaviour could lead to arrest under laws such as indecent exposure.

2SLGBTQI+ persons should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Benin.

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Benin.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Benin, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Benin.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Benin by an abducting parent:

* act as quickly as you can
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Benin to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.
