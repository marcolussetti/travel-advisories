## Natural disasters and climate

### Rainy season

In the south, there are two rainy seasons: from April to mid-July and mid-September to October. In the north, the rainy season extends from June to September.

Seasonal flooding can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable due to mudslides and landslides. Bridges, buildings, and infrastructure may be damaged.

* Monitor local media for the latest updates, including road conditions
* Stay away from flooded areas
* Monitor weather reports
* Follow instructions from local authorities, including evacuation orders

### Seasonal wind

The harmattan, a hot, dusty, sand-laden wind, blows from the Sahara from December to March.

The harmattan can disrupt travel and reduce visibility. It can also severely affect the health of people suffering from respiratory ailments.

* Keep informed of local weather forecast
* Plan your activities accordingly

### Wildfires

Forest and brush fires are frequent between July and August, especially in the northern part of the country.

Air quality in areas affected by forest fires can deteriorate due to dense smoke.

In the event of a major fire:

* stay away from affected areas, especially if you suffer from respiratory problems
* follow the instructions of local emergency services personnel
* monitor local media to stay informed of the evolving situation
