Armed groups operate along the borders with Burkina Faso, Niger and Nigeria, including in national parks, in the departments of Atacora, Alibori and Borgou, as well as the area north of National Highway 7. Attacks and kidnappings occur in these areas.

There is also a risk of incursion by Nigerian militants into the Nigerian border regions in the Collines, Plateau and Ouémé departments.

### Crime

Petty crimes, such as purse snatching and pickpocketing, occur.

Theft is frequent in Cotonou:

Terrorists may use such occasions to mount attacks.

### Road safety

Many fatal accidents occur due to poorly maintained vehicles and roads, and failure to observe speed limits. Helmets should be worn when riding motorcycles, as emergency services have variable response times.

#### Road conditions

Road conditions vary considerably throughout the country. Roads are paved and in fairly good condition in Cotonou, along the coast and as far north as Niger. Elsewhere, most secondary roads are unpaved and can become impassable during the rainy season. Drivers may change lanes without warning because of broken-down vehicles and potholes.

Driving can also be dangerous due to:

* insufficient lighting
* vehicles not using their headlights at night
* lack of guardrail
* lack of traffic signs
* the presence of pedestrians on the road
* overloaded vehicles

#### Driving habits

Drivers don’t always follow traffic laws. They can be reckless.

If you choose to drive in Bénin:

* always drive defensively
* plan your trip in advance, especially if you're visiting a rural area
* avoid traveling after dark, especially:
  + on the freeway along the coast;
  + in areas close to the Togo and Nigeria borders;
  + on the road between Cotonou and Parakou.

#### Road blocks

Roadblocks are common throughout the country.

You may be asked for identification.

* Be prepared to show your identification
* Keep a certified copy of your passport with you at all times
* Do not pass through a roadblock without stopping, even if it appears to be unattended

### Tourist infrastructure

Tourist facilities are limited outside Cotonou.

If you plan to travel outside Cotonou:

### Water activities

Coastal waters can be dangerous.  Changing tides and strong winds can cause dangerous riptides.

#### Swimming

Beaches are generally unsupervised.  Not all have warning flags to warn of dangerous conditions.

Rescue services do not always meet international standards.

Many drownings occur every year.

* Never swim alone
* Keep a safe distance from boats and prohibited areas
* Consult local residents and tour operators for information on possible risks and safe swimming areas;
* Monitor weather alerts

### Public transportation

Public transport services are limited and unreliable.

The quality and safety of private long-distance buses varies widely. Collective taxis, taxis brousses or bush taxis, are generally overcrowded and poorly maintained.
