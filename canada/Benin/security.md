Armed groups operate along the borders with Burkina Faso, Niger and Nigeria, including in national parks, in the departments of Atacora, Alibori and Borgou, as well as the area north of National Highway 7. Attacks and kidnappings occur in these areas.

There is also a risk of incursion by Nigerian militants into the Nigerian border regions in the Collines, Plateau and Ouémé departments.

Petty crimes, such as purse snatching and pickpocketing, occur.

Theft is frequent in Cotonou:

### Road safety

Many fatal accidents occur due to poorly maintained vehicles and roads, and failure to observe speed limits. Helmets should be worn when riding motorcycles, as emergency services have variable response times.

#### Road conditions

Road conditions vary considerably throughout the country. Roads are paved and in fairly good condition in Cotonou, along the coast and as far north as Niger. Elsewhere, most secondary roads are unpaved and can become impassable during the rainy season. Drivers may change lanes without warning because of broken-down vehicles and potholes.

Driving can also be dangerous due to:

* insufficient lighting
* vehicles not using their headlights at night
* lack of guardrail
* lack of traffic signs
* the presence of pedestrians on the road
* overloaded vehicles

Drivers don’t always follow traffic laws. They can be reckless.

### Water activities

Coastal waters can be dangerous.  Changing tides and strong winds can cause dangerous riptides.

Many drownings occur every year.
