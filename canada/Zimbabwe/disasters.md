## Natural disasters and climate

Since the beginning of January 2026, heavy rains have caused flooding and landslides, resulting in numerous casualties and damage to buildings and infrastructure.

The following essential services are disrupted in some areas:

* transportation
* power distribution
* telecommunication networks

If you're in or around an affected area:

* exercise caution and avoid flooded roads and low-lying areas
* monitor local news and weather reports
* confirm the status of roads with local authorities
* follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders

### Rainy season and cyclones

The rainy season extends from November to March. Seasonal flooding can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable and bridges damaged.

During this season, cyclones also occur.

If you travel to Zimbabwe during this time:

* stay informed of the latest regional weather forecasts
* carry emergency contact information for your airline or tour operator
* follow the advice and instructions of local authorities

### Bushfires

Veld (bush) fires are common during the dry season (April to October). They are very unpredictable and extremely dangerous. They can spread very quickly and travel at speeds of 60 km/h or more, due to high winds.

* Stay clear of active fires
* Always verify local conditions with relevant authorities before going on bush walks, particularly during the dry season
