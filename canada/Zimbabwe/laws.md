### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Zimbabwe.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Zimbabwe, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Zimbabwean court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Zimbabwe to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

You can bring in any amount of cash into Zimbabwe. However, you can only leave the country with a maximum of US$10,000 in cash, or the equivalent in other foreign currencies, unless you completed a blue Baggage Declaration form upon entry at the airport.

* Check with your tour operator or hotel which payment methods will be accepted
* Change currency at registered currency exchange offices only
