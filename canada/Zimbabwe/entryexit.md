# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.

We have obtained the information on this page from the Zimbabwean authorities. It can, however, change at any time.

Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

### Passport

Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you use for travel.

Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.

#### Regular Canadian passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond the date you expect to leave Zimbabwe.

#### Passport for official travel

Different entry rules may apply.

#### Passport with “X” gender identifier

While the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Other travel documents

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.

#### Business visa and work permit

If you enter Zimbabwe with a business visa or work permit, you cannot extend it from within the country.

You will need to exit the country and either:

* re-enter as a visitor
* or apply for a new business visa or work permit and wait for its delivery before re-entering

#### Working or living in Zimbabwe

It’s very difficult to arrange a work permit or residential visa after arriving in Zimbabwe.

If you plan on working or living in Zimbabwe, you should contact the nearest Zimbabwean diplomatic office before your arrival.

Volunteering and missionary activities are considered work. You will require a business visa to engage in these activities.

#### Journalists

Foreign media organizations must obtain prior accreditation for their journalists visiting or working in Zimbabwe.

Journalists attempting to enter the country without proper advance accreditation may be denied entry or deported. Journalists working in Zimbabwe without accreditation risk arrest and prosecution.

If you are seeking registration to enter Zimbabwe as a journalist, contact the nearest Zimbabwean diplomatic office well ahead of your planned departure.
