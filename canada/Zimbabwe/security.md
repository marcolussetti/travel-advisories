# Safety and security

## Safety and security

### Demonstrations and civil unrest

Demonstrations and civil unrest may occur. They usually take place in the central business district and high density suburbs of major cities such as Harare and Bulawayo. They have led to violence in the past.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Don’t attempt to cross roadblocks, even if they appear unattended
* Always carry photo identification, such as your passport, with you

### Marange mining area

Security forces restrict the access to the Marange diamond mining fields in Chiadzwa, Mutare.

Don’t attempt to enter the area.

### Crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs regularly. Crime also includes incidents such as:

* muggings
* house robberies
* passport theft
* carjacking

Highway robberies are common, particularly at night. Robberies from vehicles have occurred on the road to and from the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport and when travelling through the Beitbridge area. There is also an increased risk of crime near the border with Mozambique.

In addition, you should particularly cautious:

* in large cities such as Harare and Bulawayo
* at tourist sites such as Victoria Falls and Honde Valley waterfalls, including Mterazi Falls and Pungwe Falls
* at popular safari camps in the Hwange and Mana Pools national parks

Criminals target both foreigners and residents.

Local police are often unable to travel to the site of a reported crime. The police are likely to ask you to travel to a local police station to file a report, or to make arrangements to transport police officers to your location.

* Be vigilant and avoid travelling alone at all times
* Avoid walking after dark
* Be particularly cautious when leaving banks and after using ATMs
* Drive to the nearest police station if you suspect that you are being followed by an unknown driver
* Drive with your doors locked and windows up at all times
* Park in a guarded parking lot overnight
* Ensure that your personal belongings are secure at all times

### Fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud occurs. When using debit or credit cards:

* pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others
* use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements

There have also been fraud attempts through emails.

Carefully scrutinize any unsolicited business proposal.

### Outages and shortages

Power outages are common. Many regions, including the city of Harare, regularly experience long and frequent interruptions to the electrical and water supplies. Outages may be scheduled by local authorities or occur without notice. This can affect telecommunications networks.

Food and fuel shortages also occur.

Keep supplies of food, water and fuel on hand in the event of lengthy disruptions.

### Wildlife viewing

Wildlife viewing can be risky, particularly if you are on foot or at close range.

* Always keep a safe distance when watching wildlife
* Leave a vehicle only when a professional guide or warden says it’s safe to do so
* Use only reputable and professional guides or tour operators
* Closely follow park regulations and wardens’ instructions

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety are poor throughout the country.

#### Road conditions

Most roads don’t have street lights. Potholes are common and cause many road accidents. Highways are often narrow and have sharp downhill stretches. Pedestrians often walk on the roads, even at night. Domestic and wild animals roam major roads, also posing a risk.

Avoid driving after dark.

#### Road safety

Drivers are reckless and don’t respect traffic laws. Traffic lights are frequently broken, and drivers don’t treat non-functioning lights as four-way stops.  They instead use hazard lights when entering these intersections. This often results in accidents.

Vehicles are often poorly maintained. Drivers may not have functioning lights on their cars, which makes driving at night even more dangerous. Pay close attention before proceeding through an intersection.

#### Roadblocks

Security forces may erect roadblocks anywhere without notice. They use them to enforce order and collect fines, particularly in urban centres and on major roads.

Security forces can search you and your vehicle any time, as well as any person travelling with you. They can seize any items they deem suspicious during a search. Police officers may ask you to accompany them to the police station or to pay a fine on the spot.

* Drive carefully and always cooperate if you are stopped
* Don’t go through roadblocks without stopping, even if they appear unattended
* Ask for a ticket to be issued if you are fined by local authorities, as fines on-the-spot are illegal

### Public transportation

Public transport is very limited and services are not reliable.

#### Bus

Commuter buses or “combis” are often overcrowded, uninsured and poorly maintained. Drivers are reckless.

Avoid using intercity bus services.

#### Trains

The rail system is underdeveloped and poorly maintained, resulting in numerous accidents.

Avoid using rail services.

#### Taxis

Taxi service is only available in major cities. Taxis will normally not take you more than 20 km outside the city limits.

Major hotels usually have their own taxis, which are safe for intra-city travel.

Taxis recommended by hotels are normally reliable and in good condition.

* Only use a reputable taxi company
* Book taxis through your hotel or an authorized taxi centre
