## Natural disasters and climate

### Climate change

Climate change is affecting Spain. Extreme and unusual weather events are becoming more frequent and may affect your travel plans. Monitor local news to stay informed on the current situation.

### Wildfires

High temperatures create dry conditions, which can lead to large fires throughout Spain, particularly during the summer. Fires can lead to railway and road closures, including major highways, and affect air traffic.

Heavy smoke may deteriorate the air quality in areas near active fires.

In case of a major fire:

* stay away from the affected area, particularly if you suffer from respiratory ailments
* follow the instructions of local authorities, including any evacuation orders
* monitor local media for the latest information

### Flooding and landslides

Heavy rains can cause flooding and landslides. Roads may become impassable and infrastructure damaged.

* Exercise caution, particularly in areas around rivers
* Stay informed of the latest regional weather forecasts
* Follow the advice of local authorities, including evacuation orders

### Storms

Torrential rainfall and storms are common during the fall on the Mediterranean coast, particularly in the Valencian Community and the Balearic Islands.

Winter storms and heavy snowfall may also occur, particularly in northern and mountainous areas.

### Mountainous areas

The weather in mountainous areas can be unpredictable. If you plan a mountain or skiing holiday, stay informed of the latest weather and safety conditions.

Hazardous winter conditions, such as heavy snowfall, blizzards and freezing temperatures, may put pilgrims at risk on the French route of St. James Way (“Camino de Santiago”). As a result, between November 1 and March 31, the East access through Navarra via Lepoeder is closed.

Follow signage and take the West route (Luzaide/Valcarlos) during this period.
