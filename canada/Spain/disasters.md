## Natural disasters and climate

### Storm Leonardo

Heavy rains caused by storm Leonardo are forecast for parts of Spain until at least February 4, 2025. The storm is expected to hit especially hard in Andalusia, in the southwest, and Galicia, in the northwest.

Many of the affected areas are still recovering from damages due to the recent impact of storm Kristin. Storm Leonardo could bring further damage to infrastructure and cause severe disruptions to travel and transportation in the area.

If you are in an affected area:

* monitor local news and weather reports
* confirm your flight status before going to the airport
* follow the instructions of local authorities

### Climate change

Climate change is affecting Spain. Extreme and unusual weather events are becoming more frequent and may affect your travel plans. Monitor local news to stay informed on the current situation.

### Wildfires

High temperatures create dry conditions, which can lead to large fires throughout Spain, particularly during the summer. Fires can lead to railway and road closures, including major highways, and affect air traffic.

Heavy smoke may deteriorate the air quality in areas near active fires.

In case of a major fire:

* stay away from the affected area, particularly if you suffer from respiratory ailments
* follow the instructions of local authorities, including any evacuation orders
* monitor local media for the latest information

### Mountainous areas

The weather in mountainous areas can be unpredictable. If you plan a mountain or skiing holiday, stay informed of the latest weather and safety conditions.

Hazardous winter conditions, such as heavy snowfall, blizzards and freezing temperatures, may put pilgrims at risk on the French route of St. James Way (“Camino de Santiago”). As a result, between November 1 and March 31, the East access through Navarra via Lepoeder is closed.

Follow signage and take the West route (Luzaide/Valcarlos) during this period.
