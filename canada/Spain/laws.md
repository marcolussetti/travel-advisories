## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Transfer to a Canadian prison

Canada and Spain are signatories to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in Spain to request a transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both Canadian and Spain authorities.

This process can take a long time, and there is no guarantee that the transfer will be approved by either or both sides.

### Identification

Local authorities may ask you to show ID at any time. You must carry an adequate ID, such as a passport, to show upon request. You could be detained until you can prove your identity.

Keep a photocopy or digital copy of your passport’s photo page in a safe place should your passport be lost or seized.

In Spain, foreign visitors must present a passport upon check-in at a hotel. Restaurants, hotels, shops and other such establishments also routinely request passports or other pieces of government-issued photo identification, such as a driver’s licence, to process credit card transactions.

* Don’t leave your passport or any other ID document with anyone
* Wait until they have taken the details or made a copy of it and have given the document back to you

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect jail sentences or heavy fines.

#### Alcohol

In several autonomous regions and municipalities, including Madrid, Barcelona and the Balearic Islands, alcohol consumption in the street is prohibited. If you don’t comply, you could be fined.

### Photography

It is illegal to photograph military installations.

### Beachwear

Some municipalities, including Barcelona, have banned beachwear outside of local beaches, including on beachfront promenades.

If caught, you could face on-the-spot fines.

### Counterfeit merchandise

It is illegal in certain municipalities to buy counterfeit merchandise from street vendors, such as sunglasses or purses.

Local authorities may impose heavy fines on tourists caught buying counterfeit merchandise.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Spain.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of Spain, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Spain.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Spain, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Spanish court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Spain to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

### Driving

You can drive in Spain with your valid Canadian driver’s licence and an international driving permit for up to 6 months. For stays longer than 6 months, you must obtain a local driver’s licence.

Vehicles must be equipped for emergency situations. You must carry the following items:

* 2 red warning triangles, of which one must be placed in front of the vehicle and one behind in case of accident or breakdown
* a reflective jacket, kept inside the car (not in the trunk), that you must wear when leaving a vehicle stranded or involved in a highway accident
* a spare tire and a repair kit
* a full set of spare light bulbs, plus the tools to change them
* snow chains if travelling in adverse winter conditions

You may be subject to on-the-spot fines if you fail to comply with these laws.

#### Emission zones

Certain cities have put in place low-emission or zero-emission zones (Zona de Bajas Emisiones [ZBE] and Area Central Cero Emisiones [ACCE]) to reduce air pollution. Access to these zones is restricted, and speed limits are lowered.

You may need to obtain a permit to prove that your vehicle responds to environmental standards.

### Money

The currency of Spain is the euro (EUR).

If you are carrying €10,000 or more, or the equivalent in other currencies, you must make a declaration to customs when you enter or leave the European Union. It includes sums in:

* banknotes and coins
* bearer negotiable instruments such as cheques, travellers’ cheques, promissory notes and money orders
* bonds, shares
* gold coins with a gold content of at least 90 %
* gold bars, nuggets or clumps with a gold content of at least 99.5 %
* any other convertible asset

This does not apply if you are travelling within the European Union or in transit to a non-EU country.
