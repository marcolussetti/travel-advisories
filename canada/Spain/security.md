## Safety and security

### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, is common. It’s most prevalent in larger cities and particularly during holidays, festivals and weekends.

Thieves work alone or in groups and may use various techniques to distract you and steal your belongings, such as asking for directions or informing you of a stain on your clothes.

Individuals posing as plainclothes police officers may ask to see your passport, IDs or wallets. In this situation, politely ask to see their official identification badge to verify that the request is legitimate.

Thieves are especially active in crowded areas, such as:

* airports and public transportation facilities
* hotel lobbies
* restaurants, patios and outdoor cafés
* beaches
* tourist attractions

#### Madrid

In Madrid, thieves are particularly active in the following areas:

* Atocha train station
* Gran Vía
* Plaza Cibeles and Paseo del Prado
* Puerta del Sol area, Plaza Mayor and surrounding streets
* Retiro park
* the subway system

#### Barcelona

There has been a significant increase in stolen passports in the Barcelona region during the last few years.

In Barcelona, thieves are particularly active in the following areas:

* Barceloneta beach
* El-Prat airport and on the airport shuttle bus (the Aerobus)
* Güell park
* Las Ramblas, including in Internet cafés
* Passeig de Gràcia
* Plaça de Catalunya
* Plaça Reial and surrounding streets of the old city (Ciutat Vella
* Sagrada Família Basilica
* Sants train and bus station

While in Spain:

* ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* carry a photocopy or digital copy of your passport identification page, driver’s licence, train or airline tickets and credit cards
* at the beach, bring only the essentials
* expect travel delays and additional expenses if your passport is stolen
* don’t leave luggage unattended at airport check-in or ticket counters, car rental desks or hotel lobbies
* avoid frequenting unlit areas

#### Violent crime

Violent crime is rare but does occur. Home burglaries happen in larger cities and coastal areas and sometimes affect homes or vacation rental apartments offered through online accommodation apps.

#### On the road

Thieves have been known to simulate or provoke road-related incidents, such as flat tires. When a motorist stops to help, the thieves steal the motorist’s car or belongings. The reverse scenario has also occurred, whereby a thief offers to help a motorist in distress and steals the motorist’s car or belongings.

In the event of a road-related incident, be extremely cautious about accepting help from anyone other than a uniformed officer from the National Police Corps or Civil Guard.

There is also a high threat of theft from rental and parked vehicles.

* Be particularly vigilant in service areas on coastal highways
* Use secure parking facilities
* Avoid leaving any luggage or valuables in the vehicle
* Always lock your doors and keep windows closed

#### Foreign Tourist Assistance Service

Several municipalities have dedicated police units for foreign tourists (SATE) and offer services in English and other languages.

You can also call the tourist hotline to file a police report with the assistance of a translator.

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in Europe. Terrorists have carried out attacks in several European cities.

In Spain, attacks causing deaths and injuries have taken place. Further attacks in Spain cannot be ruled out. Further attacks elsewhere in Europe are likely.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

 Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places. Be particularly vigilant if attending sporting events and during religious holidays and other public celebrations, as terrorists have used such occasions to mount attacks.

The Spanish government maintains a public alert system on terrorism and communicates threat level changes online and through local media. The current threat level for Spain is level 4 (“high”) on a scale of 5.

### Fraud

#### Internet scams

Unsolicited emails offering enticing business or financial opportunities are most likely fraudulent.

These emails may involve the following scenarios:

* prizes won in the Spanish lottery (el Gordo)
* inheritance
* a friend or family member who appears to be in distress abroad

Never send funds to an unknown individual. Don’t travel to Spain to obtain restitution after losing money to a scam.

#### Romance scams

If you’re travelling to Spain to meet someone you’ve otherwise only met online, you may be the victim of a scam. Be wary of attempts at fraud by persons who profess friendship or romantic interest over the internet.

#### Investment scams

If you plan to buy a property or make other investments in Spain, seek legal advice in Canada and Spain. Do so before making commitments. Related disputes could take time and be costly to resolve.

#### Credit card and ATM fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud occurs.

When using debit or credit cards:

* pay careful attention if other people are handling your cards
* use ATMs located in public areas or inside a bank or business
* avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature
* cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN
* check for any unauthorized transaction on your account statements

### Spiked food and drinks

Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as the items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

### Demonstrations and strikes

Demonstrations and strikes occur regularly. They also take place sporadically in Catalonia, including in Barcelona, in response to political events. Violent clashes between demonstrators and police have taken place.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to traffic and public transportation disruptions, including access to roads, airports, and the railway and metro systems. Flight delays or cancellations, as well as disruptions at ports, are also possible.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations
* Be prepared to change your travel plans on short notice

### Swimming and water activities

Coastal waters can be dangerous. Always obey warning flags at beaches, lakes and rivers.

The main warning flags used in Spain are:

* Green: calm waters, swimming is allowed
* Yellow: agitated waters, swimming with precautions is recommended
* Red: dangerous waters, swimming or entering the water is forbidden
* Black: contaminated waters, avoid swimming

In marine areas, coral, jellyfish and other ocean life found along reefs can poison, sting or cause infection if touched or stepped on.

* Ask local authorities about the presence of such species and whether they are dangerous
* Immediately seek medical assistance if you get hurt

In the fall and winter months, be cautious when walking along beaches close to the water’s edge as waves can be unpredictable in size and may come onto shore further than expected.

* Don’t visit beaches or coastal areas during periods of severe weather warnings
* Look out for signs warning of cliff erosion and falling rocks
* Don’t dive into unknown waters, as hidden rocks or shallow depths can cause serious injury or death
* Exercise caution and follow the advice of the local authorities

### Mountain activities

If you intend to do mountaineering or skiing:

* never do so alone and always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* ensure that you’re adequately equipped and well informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* inform a family member or friend of your itinerary, including when you expect to be back
* know the symptoms of high-altitude illnesses, which can be fatal
* obtain detailed information on trekking routes or ski slopes before setting out and do not venture off marked trails or slopes

### Road safety

Road conditions and road safety can vary throughout the country. Some drivers are aggressive and drive at excessive speeds.

Travellers may experience delays crossing between Spain and Gibraltar due to increased border controls.

* Be sure you are prepared for lengthy delays
* Plan for an adequate supply of fuel, food, and water
