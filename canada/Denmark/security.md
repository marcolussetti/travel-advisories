## Safety and security

### Crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing, luggage snatching and purse snatching, occurs in large cities. It is most common during the tourist seasons, in the summer and winter holidays. The areas most affected include:

* tourist areas
* public transportation
* hotel lobbies
* restaurants

Pickpockets and purse snatchers may work in teams. One person will distract the victim while another commits the robbery.

Professional, well-dressed thieves target hotel lobbies and restaurants These thieves blend in with the guests and target their bags, passports and purses while they are distracted.

* Be especially vigilant in hotel lobbies and restaurants
* Ensure that your personal belongings, including passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
* Avoid poorly lit areas, particularly at night

### Gang-related crime

Gang-related violence has occurred in certain areas of Copenhagen., particularly in the neighbourhoods of:

* Christiania
* Nørrebro
* Brønshøj- Husum

### Christiania

Violent confrontations between law enforcement authorities and organized crime have happened in the past and could occur again.

On August 26, 2023, a fatal shooting linked to gang violence and the drug trade occurred in Freetown Christiania in Copenhagen. This was the fourth fatal shooting connected to the drug trade since 2020. Residents have called for an end to the previously tolerated drug trade in the area. If you are in Christiania, avoid areas where an open trade in illegal drugs takes place.

There is zero tolerance for photography in Christiania and tourists have become victims of assault and robbery after taking pictures. If you travel to this area:

* be vigilant and aware of your surroundings
* don’t take pictures while you’re there

### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in Europe. Terrorists have carried out attacks in several European cities and further attacks are likely.

Targets could include:

* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners

Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places. Be particularly vigilant if attending sporting events and during religious holidays and other public celebrations, as terrorists have used such occasions to mount attacks.

The Danish Security and Intelligence Service maintains a public alert system on terrorism. It communicates threat-level changes on its website and through local and social media. Denmark's current threat level is 4,«significant», on a 5-step scale.

### Demonstrations

Demonstrations occur from time to time in large cities. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* Follow the instructions of local authorities
* Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations
