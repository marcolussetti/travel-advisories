## Laws and culture

You must abide by local laws.

Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention).

### Transfer to a Canadian prison

Canada and Denmark are signatories to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in Denmark to request a transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both Canadian and Denmark authorities.

This process can take a long time, and there is no guarantee that the transfer will be approved by either or both sides.

### Identification

It’s illegal to cover your face in public places. Exempted purposes include protecting yourself against the weather or wearing a face mask for health reasons. Failure to comply can lead to a fine.

### Drugs

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect prison sentences or heavy fines.

### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Denmark.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Denmark, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit).

### Compulsory military service

Male Danish citizens who reside in Denmark are subject to compulsory military service. You may still be subject to this requirement if you’re a dual Canadian-Danish citizen.

### International Child Abduction

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and Denmark.

If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Denmark, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the Danish court.

If you are in this situation:

* act as quickly as you can
* contact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention
* consult a lawyer in Canada and in Denmark to explore all the legal options for the return of your child
* report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre

If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.

Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

The currency of Denmark is the Danish krone (DKK).

Some stores will add a surcharge to the total amount when payment is made with a foreign credit card.

If you are carrying €10,000 or more, or the equivalent in other currencies, you must make a declaration to customs when you enter or leave the European Union. It includes sums in:

* banknotes and coins
* bearer negotiable instruments such as cheques, travellers’ cheques, promissory notes and money orders
* bonds, shares
* gold coins with a gold content of at least 90 %
* gold bars, nuggets or clumps with a gold content of at least 99.5 %
* any other convertible asset

This does not apply if you are travelling within the European Union or in transit to a non-EU country.
