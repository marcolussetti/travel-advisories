# Entry and exit requirements

## Entry and exit requirements

Antarctica is governed through an international treaty system and is not owned by any one nation.

### Passport and visas

You may need a Canadian passport and/or a visa for the countries you transit as you travel en route to and from Antarctica.

Refer to the separate [Travel advice and advisories](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/advisories) for those countries.

### Expedition permits

All Canadian travellers require a permit to visit Antarctica. Expedition tour operators will usually make necessary arrangements to obtain it on your behalf. Confirm this information with your tour operator before travelling.

Should you need to apply for a permit yourself, you must submit your request to the Antarctic Environmental Program at Environment Canada.
