## Natural disasters and climate

The weather in Antarctica is extreme. From March to September, temperatures can drop to -60C near sea level, and even lower in the interior. At the peak of winter, the continent receives little to no sunlight. Organized tours don't operate during this period.

During mid-summer, from December to January, temperatures are around -2C to 4C. On the Antarctic Peninsula, temperatures can reach the low double-digits. There is sunlight up to 24 hours per day, depending on the location.

Blizzards are rare. However, in coastal areas, katabatic winds regularly reach speeds of more than 100 km/h. Gusts of up to 160 km/h are not uncommon.
