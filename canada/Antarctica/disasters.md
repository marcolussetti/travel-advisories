## Natural disasters and climate

The weather in Antarctica is extreme. From March to September, temperatures can drop to -60C near sea level, and even lower in the interior. At the peak of winter, the continent receives little to no sunlight. Organized tours donâ€™t operate during this period.

During mid-summer, from December to January, temperatures are around -2C to 4C. On the Antarctic Peninsula, temperatures can reach the low double-digits. There is sunlight up to 24 hours per day, depending on the location.

Blizzards are rare. However, in coastal areas, katabatic winds regularly reach speeds of more than 100 km/h. Gusts of up to 160 km/h are not uncommon.
