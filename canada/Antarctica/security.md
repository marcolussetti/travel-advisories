## Safety and security

### Weather conditions

Antarctica is subject to extreme and unpredictable weather conditions. It is cold, dry and windy, with 99% of the continent covered by a permanent ice sheet.

These conditions put you at risk of frostbite and sun overexposure, which can result in dehydration and eye damage.

Ensure that you have equipment and clothing that meet Antarctic standards.

### Communications

There are no public phone or other public communication services in Antarctica. In case of an emergency, you may have difficulties in obtaining outside assistance.

Research stations can house satellite telephones and postal facilities. However, they are fully dedicated to scientific research and, with rare exceptions, have no capacity to provide support of any kind to tourists or casual travellers.

If you plan to visit Antarctica as an independent traveller, ensure to be self-sufficient from the time that you leave the departure country until your return.

### Tourism

There are no tourist facilities on land, except a privately run base on the interior ice that caters to mountaineering-type expeditions.

Travelling to Antarctica may have a potential harmful impact on the environment. As a result, you should avoid any travel that is not part of an international scientific expedition or organized through a tour operator. Various tourism companies can arrange excursions to the continent.
