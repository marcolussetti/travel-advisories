# âž¤ travel-advisories

This project maintains an unofficial history of travel advisories from various governments.

This is stored as git history, so that you can see changes over time via the git history. You can learn more about this approach, often called "git scraping" by reading [this blog entry by Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/). In particular, Simon developed a tool called [git-history](https://github.com/simonw/git-history) that allows analyzing this history in an easy way.
